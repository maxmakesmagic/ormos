It's time for the final [*Eventide* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/eventide/home) update.


There's a new weekly puzzles and wallpaper, a new flavor piece by Doug Beyer, and, of course, the constantly updated Visual Spoiler with all the officially previewed cards so far. That includes cards that have been previewed in magazines, so there might be cards in there *right now* that you haven't seen. And it all exists in *nine different languages*! Exciting!


So what are you waiting for? The [*Eventide* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/eventide/home) is waiting!
