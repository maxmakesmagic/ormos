During Round 1 of Pro Tour **Theros**, competitor Gaudenis Vidugiris was disqualified for Unsporting Conduct - Cheating.


He was found to have drawn an opening hand of eight cards and then not drawn during his first turn.

This was not believed to be a premeditated action but is not permissible at this level of play. As a result, he was disqualified from this event.
