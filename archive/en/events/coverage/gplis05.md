GRAND PRIX LISBON 2005
----------------------


Local Levels Lisbon!
====================




April 22-24











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplisb05/fin.jpg)It really couldn't ended in any other way, could it? Marcio Carvalho breezed through the tournament without even picking up a scratch. His only "non-wins" came from two Intentional Draws. If on Day 1 he was helped by an outstanding card pool, on the second day he showed how well he knows this drafting format.


The final was a crowning moment for Portuguese **Magic**  this year, with two good players battling for the title. Luis Sousa did the best he could but there was no stopping the Marcio Carvalho Express.
