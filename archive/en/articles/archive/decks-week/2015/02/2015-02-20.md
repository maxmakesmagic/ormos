Last weekend at Grand Prix Seville, Standard format with *Fate Reforged* made its big debut on the Grand Prix stage. Immanuel Gerschenson earned his second Grand Prix title courtesy of his Blue-Black Control deck, sporting new cards such as [Crux of Fate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate) and [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon). Along with this event's Top 8 decklists, our coverage staff also brought you the remaining 82 decklists from Day Two's competitors.



Go ahead and jump in and explore what Standard options are out there, because this is your last chance to qualify for Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*—taking place April 10–12 in Brussels, Belgium—at [a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/content/eventsscheduleprotourqualifiers)! The format is Standard, and you've got 90 decklists to reference when building your PTQ deck, so best of luck!



In addition to that, we've also got some Deck Diaries from four of the competitors from Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*. The deck builders documented the process of how they arrived at the Modern decks they used at the Pro Tour, so if you're looking for a pro's insight into deck selection, dive in!
