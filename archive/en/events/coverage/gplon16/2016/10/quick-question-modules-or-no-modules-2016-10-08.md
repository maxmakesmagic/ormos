As always with a new Limited format, in the early days, you get some wildly differing opinions on certain cards or group of cards. In *Kaladesh* Limited, some people won't touch the more clunky artifacts like [Whirlermaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirlermaker) at all, while others are actually glad to have such a mana sink available. The same goes for the trio of [Animation Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animation+Module), [Decoction Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decoction+Module), and [Fabrication Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabrication+Module). At the heart of this debate lies the all-important question: How fast, how aggressive, how tempo oriented is the Limited environment? Too fast for Modules?

**2016 World Championship finalist Márcio Carvalho:** It depends on the deck of course. All of these cards are good in Sealed. Games tend to be long and grindy. Well, unless you run into [Renegade Freighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Freighter) at least. In Draft things go a lot faster obviously, but the format is still way slower than *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited or *Shadows over Innistrad / Eldritch Moon* Limited.

**Hall of Famer Bram Snepvangers:** I think [Whirlermaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirlermaker) is way too slow for this format.

**Pro Tour Prague 2006 quarterfinalist Quentin Martin:** No way I'll use the clunky artifacts. This is a very tempo oriented format. I spent all day chump blocking with [Cloudblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) with a flicker effect still in hand because there just was no time to ever set that up. How can you get a [Decoction Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decoction+Module) going then?

**24-time Grand Prix Top 8er Martin Jůza:** You need to have the right deck for it. [Animation Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animation+Module) is super strong if you have the green-white fabricate deck, and generally is a nice thing to do in the late game. [Fabrication Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabrication+Module) is too slow if you really go for the activated ability, but is alright in a focused energy deck. [Decoction Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decoction+Module) is great with [Whirler Virtuoso](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirler+Virtuoso) at least, and [Whirlermaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirlermaker) is a great card for Sealed Deck, sometimes too slow for Booster Draft.

**Grand Prix Rimini 2016 champion: Arne Huschenbeth:** The Modules are all sweet in energy decks. [Animation Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animation+Module) is good everywhere. [Whirlermaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirlermaker) is okay, strong in Sealed.
