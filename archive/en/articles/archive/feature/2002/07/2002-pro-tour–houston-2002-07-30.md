### Artist Appearances

**Donato Giancola**

Donato Giancola balances modern abstract concepts with realism in his paintings to bridge the worlds of fine and illustrative arts. He recognizes the significant cultural role played by visual art, and makes personal efforts to contribute to the expansion and appreciation of the science fiction and fantasy genre that extend beyond the commercial commissions of his clients. Since beginning his professional career in 1993 Donato's list of clients has continued to grow. From the major book publishers in New York to design firms on the West Coast, his commissions include companies such as LucasArts, National Geographic, DC Comics, HarperCollins Publishers, Penguin, Playboy Magazine, Sony, Tor Books, The Franklin Mint, Milton-Bradley, Hasbro, and Wizards of the Coast. 

His illustrations have won numerous awards, including four nominations for the Artist Hugo Award, a 1998 and 2000 Chesley Award for Best Gaming Product Illustration, and Gold and Silver Awards from Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art. In addition, his work has been exhibited in dozens of shows at New York's Society of Illustrators and various galleries around the country. 

Donato appears as a guest lecturer at various colleges, institutions, Magic tournaments and science fiction conventions, where he interacts with fans and displays original paintings. A comprehensive listing of his work, technique, and in depth biographical information is available on his website at [www.donatoart.com](http://www.donatoart.com).

Donato currently resides with his wife and daughter in Brooklyn, New York.

**John Matson**

John Matson developed his love of fantasy and science fiction at an early age, regularly covering his school folders and homework with doodles of an alien and barbarian persuasion. Born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he attended Milwaukee High School of the Arts and graduated in 1994 from the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design with a major in Illustration.

He credits the 1970's book cover artwork of Darrell K. Sweet, the sci-fi/fantasy movie boom of the late 70's and early 80's and Richard Amsel's movie poster art for *Raiders of the Lost Ark* as his primary springboards for pursuing a career in art of this genre. Despite a few "suggestions" from instructors to shy away from this type of subject matter, John has done his best to make a go of it, having gotten his start by shopping his portfolio around at GEN CON 1994.

John jumped on the **Magic** locomotive beginning with *Alliances*, and has more or less stayed on the train ever since. He loves being able to tell people that he draws spacemen and such for a living, and keeps his sanity by staying in touch with all the other industry and genre artists he gets to meet at various conventions.
