The match-up, according to most of the top players present, is very tilted towards Wolfgang Eder. The four Tsabo's Decrees, four Juntu Stakes and the four Spite/Malice seem just way too much for Zink to handle.


So can Wolfgang get his revenge or will Zink be the only German still standing after this battle?


### Game 1


They went about shuffling their unsleeved decks, amongst many funny German comments, with great ease. It seems the huge set-up of cameras, stage and lights was not enough to shake up the solid Germans. Strangely Daniel was wearing Felix Schneider's tournament badge. Could it be a good luck charm? Most of the crowd felt he really needed one.


Eder won the roll and thus got a chance to be the first to say "Go". Zink played a second turn Meddling Mage naming Tsabo's Decree after a short deliberation. Eder dropped his Nether Spirit tapping out but Daniel could only play a Defiant Vanguard.


The darker half of a Spite/Malice brought down the Mage letting the threat of a Decree hang in the air once again while the Spirit attacked. Zink reached five mana and brought up a Lin Sivvi. Again there was an air of Malice as Eder tapped four mana for a Spite/Malice flipping Lin into the graveyard.


The Nether wonder nibbled away and when Zink fetched out another Lin Wolfgang was once again ready. He had just peeled his third Spite/Malice! He commented on it with a smile and blew up the legendary Rebel still leaving mana open for an Undermine or a Counterspell.


The Vanguard fetched another Defiant Vanguard and the young Zink was off to the races attacking with one Vanguard bringing the score to Eder 18, Zink 12. Rebels have a way of multiplying very, very fast. The next one was a Fresh Volunteer. Zink sent two Rebels into the Red Zone and Wolfgang used a Recoil to bounce a Vanguard, which Zink promptly discarded.


With three counters in his hand Wolfgang was still in trouble. He had to keep his Nether Spirit back to block. Feeling his trouble Daniel Zink brought up a third Lin Sivvi to get the Rebel chain going at full speed.


Unknown to him, major help was on Wolfgang's way. Eder's next draw was the feared Tsabo's Decree. A Sky Marshall entered play; leaving Zink with only four mana open and Daniel tried to Lapse it. About to tap his lands to counter it, Wolfgang Eder stopped to consider it for a very, very long time. He could let it resolve and try Decreeing again on the next turn.


He checked his life totals and decided he couldn't risk it, so he countered it. Zink let that counter resolve and used a second Memory Lapse to stop the Decree. The Marshall not only ruled the skies: he also ruled the Red Zone at least for one turn.


Again Eder drew the Decree and Zink recruited a Defiant Falcon. Both players sighed loudly and got ready for another Decree-led Counter battle. Zink tried to Absorb it, Eder countered that Absorb but Daniel had another one. Not only had he gotten rid of one of the Decrees he also gained six life in the process.


The flying Rebels brought Eder down to nine and he played a main phase Opt to find an answer. All he saw was land. Lin and her goons called up two Sergeants and everyone stepped into the Red Zone to finish the first game.


Daniel 1-0 Wolfgang


### Game 2


**Sideboarding action:**  

Wolfgang took out two Recoils, four Undermines and two Dazes to side in the four Juntu Stakes, two extra Decrees and two Misdirections. Daniel took out Defiant Vanguards and the Reverent Mantras to side in three Disrupts, two Global Ruins and the fourth Absorb.


This time they shuffled in pure silence as the large crowd laughed about one of the other games being broadcasted, maybe due to some witty remark from Sideboard commentators Gary Wise and Ben Ronaldson.


Zink's headache started on the second turn when Wolfgang dropped a Juntu Stakes. His small searchers were now only able to search, or attack, once. He stared at it for a very long time but snapped back playing a Meddling Mage, naming Spite/Malice.


We locked into a pattern: they both dropped lands and the Mage attacked. Finally Eder played his stellar Nether Spirit to stop this damage dealing nonsense. Zink seized the opportunity to take a daring risk: he tapped out to cast Sky Marshall.


That would give him a chance to search up more Rebels, ignoring the Stakes or simply attack at will. Sadly for him Eder was ready with a Counterspell. In fact Wolfgang's hand was as good as it gets: Tsabo's Decree, Misdirection, Counterspell and Spite/Malice.


They went back to dropping lands and saying Go, with Wolfgang using two Accumulated Knowledges to find a second Tsabo's Decree. As the game dragged on Daniel Zink's chances dwindled. The Spirit wanted to attack so Eder Recoiled the Mage, with Zink taking the chance to cycle a Disrupt.


When the Spirit starts swinging you know you are in trouble. Daniel knew that. He tried to replay the Mage and Wolfgang threw a Counterspell at it. Zink slumped back before using an Absorb which Eder Misdirected (the hard way: paying five mana). Daniel let that resolve and played Global Ruin!


Wolfgang's eyes bulged! He wasn't expecting that, at least not at that point. They both went down to two mana, Zink disenchanted the Stakes and dropped a Sergeant. Still Eder had more topdecking skills to display: another Juntu Stakes showed up.


That spelled trouble for Zink once again. He used the Sergeant to find a Falcon hoping to at least stop the Spirit from swinging freely. Zink lapsed into his think tank but emerged quickly with the obvious, yet risky, option: he tapped out to fetch Lin.


Eder had a Spite/Malice but since it was his only counter he decided to keep it, hoping instead to draw two extra lands for the juicy Dominate. Zink played a Meddling Mage on his following turn calling Spite/Malice.


He didn't find lands but he did find an Opt and then a Fact or Fiction. When he tried to cast it Daniel had the perfect Disrupt ready. Wolfgang really wanted that Fact of Fiction so he pitched the now useless Spite/Malice to cast a Misdirection. Still Zink would not let go: he Memory Lapsed the Misdirection.


Again Wolfgang tried to Opt into land and this time he got it. His next draw was the sixth land he needed although now he had no counter back. Zink got the Marshall back into the deck and Wolfgang launched one of the three Decrees in hand.


Zink had an Absorb for that and he had another Absorb for the second one. The difference was Eder had just found his second Misdirection and blew the Absorb away. Zink revealed a Ramosian Sergeant and Global Ruin in his hand and lost his entire Rebel crew. When Tsabo sent out an order the table gets cleaned.


The last two Accumulated Knowledges refilled Wolfgang's hand as the Spirit and Mage traded blows. Zink was losing the race and things got even worse when Eder played another Spirit. Daniel found another Ramosian Sergeant and played it followed by an attempt to Global Ruin.


Wolfgang had one Counterspell and two possible Misdirections for that but instead used a Tsabo's Decree to clean up the Mages in response. Zink tried to counter that but Wolfgang Misdirected it. The Ruin resolved with Eder keeping enough mana to counter any recovery attempts and the Spirits did their dirty jobs amongst desperate chump blockers.


Daniel 1-1 Wolfgang


### Game 3


This time Daniel seemed to finally feeling the pressure as he had to leave the stage for a few minutes to recover. After sideboarding the match up is a nightmare for the Rebel player. Zink thought about trying a new trick this time: Bringing in his Obsidian Acolytes. That would give him a way to sneak by the annoying Spirit. In the end he decided to stick to his usual sideboard plan.


This time Zink came out very slowly with no play until his third turn: a Meddling Mage. Eder considered using his lone Counterspell for a long time and when he did Zink was ready it the Disrupt. The Mage locked Tsabo's Decree out the table.


When Eder played an Opt and Juntu Stakes on his turn Zink didn't seem very impressed. He played out his Lin Sivvi, with Eder tapped out, and the best Eder could do was drop a Nether Spirit to stop the incoming flood.


The young German Champion didn't want to search with Lin until he could get the Sky Marshall so he played out a Defiant Falcon. Wolfgang kept drawing lands and played out his second Nether Spirit.


He finally drew a Spite/Malice and bid his time until Zink searched up the Marshall. The Marshall stayed on the table for five seconds before a dose of Spite/Malice sent it into the graveyard.


Although he drew the Spite/Malice in the right moment Wolfgang was still seeing land like a real estate agent. He sent in one of his Spirits keeping the other one back in case the Mage tried something funny like attacking.


To make matters worse Daniel Zink had a full hand. Who knew what trouble lurked ahead? Zink brought down the hammer with an ironic Global Ruin. Even if Wolfgang would have any counters I doubt he would stop that. He lost six lands and finally drew a spell: Accumulated Knowledge. When he tapped to cast it Zink got rid of the Juntu Stakes, which troubled Eder so much he forgot to use the Opt he got out of the Knowledge.


That was especially bad when he found a Fact or Fiction with it. He had just lost a full turn. Again he sent both Spirits in bringing the score to Daniel eight, Wolfgang eighteen. Free to search again Zink got a Lieutenant and again sent his Falcon in before playing another Falcon.


The Fact or Fiction revealed three lands, Tsabo's Decree (remember the Mage was set on Decree) and Fact or Fiction. Zink split it in the following way.


**Pile one:** Salt Marsh, Fact or Fiction.  
**Pile two:** Decree, Swamp, Island.


Wolfgang got the first one. On his next turn he drew and played a Juntu Stakes, which Zink tried to stop with a Counterspell. Wolfgang desperately used the second Fact or Fiction and Daniel gave him the following piles, after thinking for a few minutes:


**Pile one:** Juntu Stakes, Misdirection.  
**Pile two:** Underground River, Misdirection.


Again Eder kept the first one and let the Counterspell resolve. The Falcons came in and the second Juntu Stakes announced another minute of silence. Carefully considering his options Zink tried to Counterspell it which Wolfgang misdirected.


Another factor came into play at this point: Daniel frequent use of the Adarkar Wastes brought him down to six and unknown to him Wolfgang Eder was holding an Undermine.


With the Stakes now on the table Daniel was once again in a semi-lock. Eder tried to play another Stakes to stay away from any Disenchant surprise but Zink used an Absorb to go up to eight (since he had to once again use the Wastes).


When Wolfgang found a Dominate with Recoil, Misdirection in hand we were in for another fight. Zink brought up the huge Sky Marshall and Eder Recoiled it, with Zink discarding a useless Lin Sivvi.


He played the Marshall out of his hand and Eder let in without a fight, perhaps setting up for a very juicy Dominate. He tapped out to cast the Dominate and Zink tried to Memory Lapse it. Wolfgang emptied his hand to Misdirect that.


Zink was now at six and had just lost his huge flyer. The treacherous Marshall made a brief Red Zone appearance once and after drawing another card Daniel Zink conceded.


Daniel 1-2 Wolfgang


### Game 4


Again they discussed the match briefly before buckling down to shuffle with Zink again considering sideboard chances. He needed all the tricks he could get. After staring at Memory Lapse and Obsidian Acolyte for a few moments he traded the Acolyte for the remaining Defiant Vanguard.


He also came out as fast as he could with Ramosian Sergeant and Meddling Mage, naming Tsabo's Decree, before Wolfgang could even get mana to counter! Eder used an Accumulated Knowledge to get more cards but Zink was smoking.


He climbed the chain while dealing as much damage as possible. When Eder reached four mana, he could finally stop the bleeding with a Spite/Malice, possibly on the Mage to free up the two Tsabo's Decree he had in his hand.


As sure as Swiss clockwork, when Daniel fished up his Lin, tapping out, Wolfgang gave the Mage a hearty goodbye. The problem was a Decree costs six and after being mana flooded in the previous game Eder couldn't get past four now. Even without that Lin Daniel had a smooth recruiting machine going.


Wolfgang Eder tried to find land with a Fact or Fiction but again a nasty Disrupt knocked the wind out of that option. The Rebels kept showing up like rabbits. Another swing brought Wolfgang down to ten before he finally found his fifth land. He also had a Dominate so if push came to shove he could pull some tricks while waiting for the sixth land.


Daniel felt he already had enough Rebels so he sent everyone in bringing Eder down to four. Desperate Wolfgang stole a Defiant Falcon and drew his sixth land. After a deep breath he passed the turn.


We were now in the decisive turn. Zink sent five Rebels in forcing Wolfgang to cast a Decree. Daniel tapped two Blue mana and a Counterspell later the game was over.


Daniel 2-2 Wolfgang


### Game 5


So speed seemed to be the answer. For a match-up most called doomed from the start, Daniel Zink had carried the quarterfinals into the fifth, and decisive, game. Could he overcome the highly favourite Wolfgang Eder and his NetherGo? They changed tables to get under the watchful eyes of the cameras. For the first time since the second game Eder reflected on his sideboard options but decided it was too late to change anything.


We ran into a small problem when Daniel's deck came out one card short when he counted it. After looking for the Dominated Falcon we found out that Daniel had it so it couldn't be that. Furious searching went on for a few minutes until someone remembered the last play. When they picked up the cards Wolfgang had probably gotten Zink's game winning Counterspell in his deck. Sure enough there it was. After a few laughs and a deep sigh of relief from Zink the shuffling got underway.


They sat in silence waiting for the word to start from the TV control room while on the other table John Ormerod and Eivind Nitter played at a glacial pace. Finally John won the third game and gave the Germans a chance to shine under the TV spotlights.


Things did not start well for Daniel Zink as he had to take a mulligan due to mana problems. The friendly Wolfgang talked to him about the mulligan with both openly discussing the situation, both to support each other and ease the camera jitters.


A Defiant Falcon came into play on the second turn while Eder playing Opting games. He got himself a nice creature on his third turn: Nether Spirit. Zink then dropped a sideboard nullifying Meddling Mage, for the first time naming Juntu Stakes.


The Nether Spirit attacked but felt so lonely Wolfgang gave it another Nether Spirit to play with. They took frequent trips to the Red Zone together while Zink searched up a Lin Sivvi. Wolfgang has a huge grudge on the legendary Rebel so he once again killed it with Spite/Malice.


The Falcon's small nibbles were no match for Spirit cavalry riding in every turn. To make matters worse a Spite/Malice got rid of the Mage allowing Eder to possibly play Juntu Stakes.


Daniel was falling behind on the race and Wolfgang was approaching the Decree mana level. Still Eder's hand only had two Misdirections and an Accumulated Knowledge, so he decided to hold his Spirits back and let Zink's Falcons ruled the Red Zone.


The Knowledge gave Wolfgang his third Misdirection! The deck was surely not helping him at all and his nervous feet tapping rumbled through the stage. Zink searched up Lin Sivvi and figured Eder was in trouble when he didn't immediately kill it.


Finally Wolfgang found a Juntu Stakes and they got into a Counter war over it. An Absorb, two Counterspells and one Misdirection later the Stakes got into the table stopping the Rebels. The Spirits were now back in the Red Zone with Lin Sivvi blocking one of them.


Zink locked the Lin under the Stakes for a chance to get the Sky Marshall unto the table. Sadly for Wolfgang he had no immediate way to stop that. Despite the Marshall blood lust Daniel thought long and hard before sending him in setting the score at Daniel 13, Eder 11.


He then dropped the bomb: Global Ruin. Wolfgang bluffed a Counterspell before letting it resolve. They were both down to two mana. Eder drew his fourth Misdirection and sent the Spirits bringing Zink down to nine.


The Marshall and Spirits were trading blows with Eder winning the race. But Zink still had a Sergeant untapped so he chumped with it and used it to get another Sergeant in play. Eder finally found a Tsabo's Decree but it was too little, too late. He would never reached six mana in time.


The cruel Marshall kept swinging in while the Sergeants sacrificed themselves to give Zink the win nobody thought he could pull when Wolfgang ended the game with five lands.


**Final Result:** Daniel 3-2 Wolfgang
