The war between the Phyrexians and the Mirrans is [coming to your store](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/warleague-mbs) in the form of the War League. Everyone's going to pick a side, and then every match everyone plays will help establish your store as either Phyrexian or Mirran turf. Soon (or possibly already) there's going to be a chart like this up on the wall:

And every match you win, you get to put a sticker up on the chart, moving it toward either Phyrexia or Mirrodin. But that's not the War League itself.

The actual War League is a recommendation from Wizards of the Coast. Everyone starts with a Sealed Deck (made without faction restrictions; your side is represented by you, not your deck) and adds one booster each Friday. It's fun!
