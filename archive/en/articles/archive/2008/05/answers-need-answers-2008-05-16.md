On turn three, [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) floats gracefully to your opponent's side of the board. You know from experience that the Elf lord is a powerful token-generating threat that can quickly crush you if you don't find a way to stop it. You anxiously draw your card for the turn and... Yes! It's [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)! Down goes [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect). The threat is averted. The problem is solved.


You've drawn "The Answer."


The back-and-forth that makes *Magic* fun is all about threats and answers. Ever since the days of Alpha, one player drops a [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) and the other player has to suffer the righteous angelic beatings until he or she can find a [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror). And whether it's Alpha, *Shadowmoor*, or any *Magic* set in between for every threat in the game, there's an answer. For every [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator), there's a [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter). For every [Calciform Pools](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciform+Pools), there's a [Demolish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish).


![Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Imperious%20Perfect&options=) Answers serve many purposes. First and foremost, they provide interactivity ensuring that every move has a countermove. Secondly, answers give you something to hope for off the top of your deck, a chance to draw your way out of whatever mess you get in. Finally, when you're building decks and evolving your strategies, answers give you tools you need to make your deck better for a certain matchup or a certain environment. When you start to get annoyed by your opponents doing something again and again, answers give you tools to use to defeat whatever has been annoying you.


But *Magic*'s answers have a lot more depth than "[Elvish Hexhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Hexhunter) your [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)." That's because *Magic* not only has threats and answers, it has answers to those answers (and then other answers to *those* answers). -1/-1 counters are the perfect example of these answers to answers, primarily through the vehicles of persist and wither.


Say you're playing green-blue against your friend's red-black deck in a *Tenth Edition* league. It's your second turn, and you have a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Your friend has played tons of [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s and [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)s in previous games, and it has been almost impossible to make your turn-two creature survive. No matter what creature you have played on turn two, it has instantly died in a fire.


You think about all the green or blue creatures for one and two mana in *Tenth Edition* and there is nothing that survives [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate). No matter what threat you present, your friend's [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) seems to be the universal answer.


Then -1/-1 counters, *Shadowmoor*, and persist enter the story. All of a sudden you can play turn-two [Safehold Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safehold+Elite), and your friend's [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) isn't nearly the universal answer it seemed to be.


You've answered the answer.


### Persist vs. *Tenth Edition*


![Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Assassinate&options=) If you unleashed all the persist creatures of *Shadowmoor* into a *Tenth Edition* Limited environment, they would wreak havoc. From the dominating [Twilight Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd) to the humble [Gravelgill Axeshark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravelgill+Axeshark), the whole persist crew would run rampant over *Tenth Edition*. That's because the creature removal answers of *Tenth Edition* Limited are cards like [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) and [Spitting Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Earth), and persist creatures answer those answers extremely effectively.


In this bizarre "*Tenth Edition* Limited plus fourteen persist cards" format, persist would be so powerful and so hard to answer that it would threaten to get really annoying and cross the line to not playing well. After all, there would be very few ways to stop the persist creatures in that world, and it would get frustrating that there wouldn't be enough ways to get around having to kill your opponent's [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) twice in a row.


Fortunately, persist didn't debut in *Tenth Edition* at all and is instead nestled in the dark realm of *Shadowmoor*. Why does persist have so much better game play in *Shadowmoor* Limited than it would in *Tenth Edition* Limited? In a word: answers.


Just as -1/-1 counters keep *Shadowmoor* creatures alive through persist, those counters also doom persist creatures to a painful, tortuous, true death through wither, [Incremental Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Blight), [Puncture Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puncture+Bolt), and many other hideous fates. Those -1/-1 counter effects provide powerful answers to persist that keep persist in a more interactive place, which is that sometimes your 5/2 persist trample [Scuzzback Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuzzback+Marauders) powerfully trades with your opponent's 5/5 [Crabapple Cohort](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crabapple+Cohort) AND 5/4 [Roughshod Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roughshod+Mentor)... and sometimes your [Scuzzback Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuzzback+Marauders) just get permanently killed by your opponent's two-mana [Puncture Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puncture+Bolt).


Part of the beauty of *Magic* is that for every threat, there's an answer. And for every answer, there's a different answer. [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) answers [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect). [Safehold Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safehold+Elite) answers [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate). Boggart-Ram Gang answers [Safehold Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safehold+Elite).


And the answers don't stop there. Can you think of a totally, totally sick answer to [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang), also built into *Shadowmoor*? [Dusk Urchins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Urchins)! If you play [Dusk Urchins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Urchins) and block [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang) with it, you kill the Ram-Gang and draw *three* extra cards. If you attack with your [Dusk Urchins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Urchins) into an opponent's [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang) and the opponent blocks, you kill the Ram-Gang and draw *four* extra cards.


So then is [Dusk Urchins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Urchins) the ultimate answer? The top of the food chain? The unanswerable answer? Of course not. What's a great answer to [Dusk Urchins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Urchins)? Good old [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)! And so the quest for the perfect answer returns to where it started. No single answer is the be-all and end-all. There's always another step down the path.

### From Microcosm to Macrocosm


This phenomenon of answers to answers plays out on many levels. When you're playing with a casual *Magic* group Tuesday nights and Jeff starts beating everybody up in duels with his [Tattermunge Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac) / [Flame Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) deck, then the next week you'll probably see people playing more protection from red creatures like [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight). That week people get beat up a bit by [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight), so the next week they start playing more [Llanowar Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Sentinel)s and 2/3s. Then people see that and next week they play [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel)s. Then next week people play [Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal)s to kill the [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel)s.


That cycle provides a new puzzle to solve every week as you try to tweak your decks to work best against whatever decks you think your friends will be running. And that puzzle is part of the fun of deckbuilding.


The same phenomenon occurs in single matches of *Shadowmoor* Limited. Maybe you didn't start out maindecking [Lockjaw Snapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lockjaw+Snapper), but in Game 1, you see your opponent is playing black-red with multiple [Gravelgill Axeshark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravelgill+Axeshark)s and multiple [Scuzzback Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuzzback+Marauders). You can sideboard in the answer, [Lockjaw Snapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lockjaw+Snapper), to fight those persist creatures.


![Tower Above](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tower%20Above&options=) And the same phenomenon occurs in *Shadowmoor* Standard Constructed. Say you are playing green-red in Standard and you start out with [Tattermunge Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac) and [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) on your first two turns off of a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and a [Fire-Lit Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Lit+Thicket). No matter what your opponent plays on his or her turn three, you plan to [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) it on your turn three and keep hitting. But your opponent plays [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks)! Your shoulders slump. [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) is an amazing answer to your [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) plan there. The Finks gain 2 life for your opponent, and when you [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) them, they just persist back into play, gain 2 more life, and *still* block your [Tattermunge Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac).


But if this keeps happening to you for a couple of weeks, you can change your deck around to find an answer to the answer of [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). Then the next time this situation happens, you untap on turn-three, play a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), play [Tower Above](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Above) on your [Tattermunge Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac), and attack with everything. Your spell forces the opposing [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) to block your 6/5 trample wither [Tattermunge Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac), you deal 6 damage to the opponent and kill the [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), the Finks don't persist back into play, and you lose nothing. You've answered the answer to your answer.


### Answers in Standard Tournaments Beyond -1/-1 Counters


In maindecks or sideboards, [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) is a powerful weapon in Standard. Putting a [Twilight Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd) into play answers [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) hard since the [Twilight Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd) persists back into play and brings your other [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation)ed creatures back to your hand. But [Twilight Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd) isn't immune to being answered itself. [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) answers [Twilight Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd) hard, removing it from the game without ever triggering persist.


[Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), and other white removal effects that remove creatures from the game or put them into their owner's library give white a nice role to play in a persist world: the color whose creature control is the best answer to persist. R&D definitely intended that as a nice angle for white to have in Constructed formats that include *Shadowmoor*.


One of the things that keeps Standard tournament *Magic* vibrant and fun is the fact that you can find answers to answers far beyond the interactions of -1/-1 counters. They're woven throughout all the mechanics in the format, and you can find them if you look.


![Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Riftsweeper&options=)


For example, players who got sick of declaring their attack with a vast army only to be tapped out by [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) have found that a timely [Guttural Response](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guttural+Response) consistently sent their whole army charging in for the win. In metagames where [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) has been the kill spell of choice, players who sought answers to [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) found them in [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) and [Phyrexian Ironfoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Ironfoot), both of which shrugged off [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw)'s comes into play effect then outfought the Elemental for less mana. Players who got bludgeoned hard by [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) found powerful answers to the Siege Tower by playing [Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark).


Creature decks have found they are far more effective against Faeries when they back up a low curve of cheap, aggressive weenies with [Squall Line](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squall+Line), [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher), [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast), or [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) than when they don't bother to play enough of those answers. And just as [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast) can answer Kithkin and Merfolk rushes, Kithkin and Merfolk decks in turn have found that [Burrenton Forge-Tender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender) can be a very effective answer to the [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast). Players who have sought powerful answers to an opposing turn-one [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) have found success by answering with turn-two [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper).


Much like the -1/-1 counters of wither provide the perfect answer to the -1/-1 counters of persist, everything in *Magic* can be answered by something else and each of those answers can in turn be answered by something else in a beautiful, never-ending, spiral fractal called the metagame. Which of those fractal paths you explore is up to you.


### Last Week's Poll




|  |
| --- |
| **Should we have printed [Gathan Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gathan+Raiders) as is?**  |
| Yes | 6192 | 85.0% |
| It's complicated | 658 | 9.0% |
| No | 438 | 6.0% |
| **Total** | **7288** | **100.0%** |

I'm glad so many people agreed that we were right to print [Gathan Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gathan+Raiders) as is, even though it's a hellbent card you can play without any red mana. For those who voted "It's complicated," I definitely agree. It's always tough to navigate the maze of reasons for when you should break your own rules and when you shouldn't. Such cases often lead to lively multiverse discussions and ad hoc debates in the Pit.
