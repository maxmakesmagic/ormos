We are deep into *Khans of Tarkir* previews, which puts writers such as myself in a somewhat odd spot. We clearly want to talk about all the awesome and exciting new cards, but *Magic* cards are very context-dependent, and it's tricky knowing exactly how good something is going to be while missing a lot of the information about the format. Some cards are so insane they stand on their own ([Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) spring to mind), but where something like Savage Knuckleblade lands is tricky to figure out. The card is clearly awesome, but three-color cards have a high bar. And aggressive cards that cost three colors are even trickier. Still, nothing is more fun than some good, old-fashioned speculation. So today I'll be looking at some of the best cards from *Theros* block (including some that saw very little play previously) and taking a stab at figuring out how they fit into the new format (from what we know of [previewed cards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ktk-cig-en) so far), as well as what they might need in order to make a big splash.

The best place to start is one of the loudest mechanics in *Theros*: devotion. Devotion decks are taking a big hit with rotation. The departure of Return to Ravnica means that all the hybrid cards (like [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird), [Burning-Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary), [Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner), and [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter)) are gone, as well as non-hybrid hits like [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor) and [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections). *Magic* *2014* takes with it [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), which was one of the biggest reasons that monocolored decks were so pushed this last year (and I, for one, will not be too sad to see it go—it's just unfair that you can play a turn-one Dragon).


The cards that pay you for devotion are all still around, and each of these decks has varying chances of recovery. But a three-color block does not bode well for decks that want to accumulate as many of one colored pip as possible. Still, cards like Thassa, Gray Merchant, and Nylea are all very strong, so it would be foolish to dismiss them out of hand.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thassa, God of the Sea)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa, God of the Sea)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Master of Waves)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master of Waves)





The two centerpieces of the Mono-Blue Devotion deck remain, but whether they have enough followers is what we really have to figure out. Losing [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor), [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar), [Galerider Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galerider+Sliver), [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage), [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird), and [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) (as well as [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and [Rapid Hybridization](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rapid+Hybridization)) is a huge hit. I suspect any deck we see playing Thassa or Master will look very different. First of all, there's no strong reason to actually be mono-blue anymore. So much of the power in Khans will be distributed among gold cards that it's going to be tough to stick to just one color. And without [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and a strictly blue curve of creatures, you don't have to be on the mono-Islands plan.


That makes me doubt the inclusion of Thassa at all, even if her Bident and [Jace, the Living Guildpact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Living+Guildpact), are still strong enablers. I just don't see there being enough U and UU low drops to make Thassa a reality, as she needs to be animated almost all the time to really be worth it. The fact that there's no card that gets her three-fifths of the way there by itself anymore is tough. Unless Khans has a bunch of uncharacteristically blue cards yet to be revealed, Thassa might sink under the waves of obscurity for at least a little while. Note that I'm not saying the same thing about [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves), mainly because Master takes way less devotion to reward those who choose to follow him, which is exactly the Zen-like attitude I'd expect from the kind of guy whose grand ambition is just to catch killer waves.


[Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) making even two tokens is already very reasonable. Even if there are just a couple of blue permanents that you would be happy playing anyway, I could see Master doing some work in Standard. It's also not completely irrelevant that Master works with Elementals such as [Frost Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Lynx) and [Vaporkin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin), both of which are cards that also complement [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) quite well. I'm not saying this deck will be nearly as dominant as Mono-Blue Devotion is currently (which isn't a bad thing), but that there was almost a mono-blue deck in *Theros* Block. And if just gets a few new cards in Khans and *Magic 2015*, it might be plausible.

Mono-Black Devotion is another deck that keenly feels the loss of [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), although it doesn't care all that much about [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) leaving. [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), and [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) are the real losses, and as a result I think the main [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) deck is going to see a vast overhaul. It was certainly less reliant on both devotion enablers and devotion cards than Mono-Blue, and some versions didn't even really have either (although by the end, [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) was fairly standard).


Instead, the loss of [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), and [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) make this deck care a lot less about playing multicolor lands, as there's no pressing need to play 25 Swamps anymore. That also kicks out poor

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hammer of Purphoros)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer of Purphoros)





Mono-Red Devotion was already somewhat on the fringe. Without [Ash Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ash+Zealot), [Burning-Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary), and [Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner), it seems like a tough sell. I do like Purphoros with various token makers (Xenagos and Elspeth are still more than happy to take advantage of what he offers), but the Nykthos-based version of Red Devotion is unlikely to continue to exist. [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel), [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), and now Sarkhan are poised to make heavy red decks very strong, so I'm not putting away my Beta Mountains just yet.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chord of Calling)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord of Calling)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nylea, God of the Hunt)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea, God of the Hunt)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Polukranos, World Eater)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos, World Eater)

Of all the Nykthos decks, Mono-Green Devotion looks like it's by far the most likely to survive. I like that, because it also happens to be my favorite one to play, and I'm looking forward to a Lifebane-less Standard that will let me cast all my giant green monsters without fear. In fact, even without knowing every card that Khans brings, this deck loses the least and gains the most (especially when you count [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) rotating).

He already cut the [Burning-Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary)s, so look at how few cards this deck loses once Standard rotates:



3 [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade)  




That's an absurdly low number of cards, and [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) can almost just be straight-up replaced by [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills). Losing Domri is unfortunate, especially given how important good low drops are for [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra), but I'm sure a replacement can be arranged. I'd also be interested in getting a Chord package in there. Something like this:



3 [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling)  




It is also very possible (in fact, even likely) that this deck could transition into a three-color version. It might seem strange to be three-color mono-green, but it actually doesn't sound crazy. Between [pain lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+%5b%22deals+1+damage+to+you%22%5d&set=+%5b%22Magic%202015%20Core%20Set%22%5d) and [fetch lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+%5bsearch%5d+%5byour%5d+%5blibrary%5d&set=|%5b%22Onslaught%22%5d) you have a lot of untapped mana sources. And using some [tri-lands](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arc/khans-tarkir-tri-lands-2014-09-05) instead of [Temples](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5bscry%5d&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&format=+%5b%22Theros+Block%22%5d) could get you to the point where casting Savage Knuckleblade or Siege Rhino isn't that hard. The rewards for doing so are great. There are all these awesome and cheap multicolor creatures that have low converted mana costs in exchange for costing lots of colors, and that makes [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) a convenient way to cheat them into play.


Just look at these Beasts (and/or Humans):

That doesn't even take into account the accompanying spells these colors give you access to, and we've already seen a bunch of exciting ones. Of the clans, Temur does seem like the frontrunner right now, but I could see Abzan stepping up, too. Chording out a Siege Rhino does have a particular appeal, although so does just casting a Savage Knuckleblade on turn two....

Brimaz has always seemed like the king without a throne. He's clearly an awesome card, but besides winning the [Block Pro Tour](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptjou14) (which certainly is something), he hasn't made any sort of catastrophic impact on Standard. That could easily change post-rotation, especially now that [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon) is ready to just go off. When your one-drop blanks three- and four-drops with ease, you have a heavy incentive to play a lot of Plains. And when there are good decks with lots of Plains, Brimaz can't be far behind. [Spear of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod) and [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) also stand out as awesome additions, and not just because Brimaz and the Lion have some shared tribal pride.


As much as the rotation of [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) disincentivizes monocolored decks, there's still plenty of room for an aggressive deck that takes advantage of everyone else playing lands that hurt them or enter the battlefield tapped, and Mono-White or Green-White may well be that deck. Green-White got 2nd at [the last Pro Tour](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15) and already didn't play [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). Even with the big loss of [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), [Experiment One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One), and [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm), it still has plenty of great options to choose from.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anger of the Gods)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger of the Gods)
While I don't have a specific deck in mind for [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods), I thought it worth highlighting. It never found a great home in Standard. But now that [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) is gone (may it rest in peace, along with actual [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace)), there's not only more need for a sweeper but more decks that can potentially play one. [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) combines very well with 4+-toughness creatures, and we have our pick of those, many of which take red mana to cast.

I've said a lot about this pair (and they even showed up in the Mono-Green deck already), so I'll keep this brief. Courser was already one of the best cards in Standard, and now it could easily be the actual best. A ton of different decks are going to play these cards, and they by themselves give extra weight to the clans that contain green and can utilize them. Don't leave your house without being prepared to play against Courser, even if you are choosing to play with it.

Mono-Black Aggro was definitely a player in *Theros* Block, and the addition of Bloodsoaked Champion (along with potentially Grim Haruspex and Mardu Skullhunter) it's looking pretty strong.


Here's a list that went 8–1–1 at [Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*](http://magic.wizards.com/node/164916), showing that a monocolor deck can thrive in a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)-less world:

Adding four Bloodsoaked Champions seems like a good start, and as we see the rest of the cards today, I wouldn't be surprised if this picks up another good add or two.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Keranos, God of Storms)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos, God of Storms)
Keranos is strong enough that he's seeing a reasonable amount of Modern play (and I've heard rumors of some Legacy sightings as well). The strength of Azorius made it tough for Keranos to find a home over these last few months, but between all of that rotating and [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) looking better (plus Temur and Jeskai make UR a supported color combination), I think Keranos might take Standard by storm.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Satyr Wayfinder)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr Wayfinder)
The last card I want to highlight is [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder). Wayfinder was already seeing play in various graveyard-based decks (and keep in mind that [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) is still legal and good), but now that the Sultai clan is hell-bent on delving in the graveyard, [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) is starting to look awesome. It enables so many different things, both by filling up your graveyard and by giving you a "free" 1/1 body, and decks that can make use of it are going to be very strong come Khans.


At the same time this article publishes we'll have the whole set and the floodgates will open, but until then I'd keep an eye on many of the cards I just talked about. Some get worse (mostly the devotion ones), but many get much better. And that's without even knowing all of what Khans has to offer. Exciting times lie ahead!
