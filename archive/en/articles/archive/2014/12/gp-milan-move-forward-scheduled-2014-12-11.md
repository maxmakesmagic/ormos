A public transport strike in Italy for December 12, 2014, [has been announced](http://www.milanomalpensa-airport.com/en/airport/news?selectedMonth=12&_ptltpl=V3PG_NOTIZIE&selectedYear=2014&newsId=1316), which may impact players who are traveling to Grand Prix Milan this weekend. No flights between Milan Malpensa and Milan Linate airports will take place on that day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. An air traffic control strike is set from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.



In addition, this strike also impacts trains in Italy from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., as well as the bus and metro stations from 7 p.m. to midnight.



Grand Prix Milan will still be open on Friday, and anyone who is planning to attend that day will still be able to do so.



The main event for Grand Prix Milan will still continue on Saturday. However, the main event will be split into two shifts. The first shift begins at the previously announced time of 9 a.m. A second shift, which will be available for players impacted by the travel strikes in Italy, will begin at noon on Saturday. For players whose flights are canceled for Friday, the second shift provides an option for those able to fly in on Saturday morning, so as few players as possible are impacted by the strikes.



Because of the strikes, online registration is a must if you are unable to arrive at the venue on Friday. If you are impacted by the strikes and have not done so, [preregister for this Grand Prix as soon as possible](http://events.tournamentcenter.eu/event/grand-prix-milan-14--2).



Tournamentcenter.EU, the tournament organizer for Grand Prix Milan, is looking into additional shuttles that can transport players from Malpensa airport to the venue. They will have more information tomorrow around 9 a.m. local time. For the latest information, please visit the [GP Milan website](http://events.tournamentcenter.eu/event/grand-prix-milan-14--2) and follow [Tournamentcenter.EU on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tournamentcentr).



We strongly advise you to call your airline regarding any potential cancellations as well as alternative options to arrive in Milan as soon as possible. Phone information for airlines flying into Malpensa can be found below:

**GP Milan Tournament Details**


In order to protect the integrity of the Grand Prix, and to allow for as many players whose travel to Grand Prix Milan was impacted by the strikes to compete, the tournament structure for Grand Prix Milan has been adjusted.


* Day One will consist of two flights. The first flight begins at 9 a.m. local time. The second flight begins at 12 p.m. local time. Both flights will be nine rounds.
* Players may not play in both Day One flights.
* The two flights on Day One will likely differ in size. Grand Prix byes apply to either flight, and players with 21 match points advance to Day Two.
* Day Two will be a new tournament. Tiebreakers from Day One will not apply to Day Two.
* As soon as a player has 21 match points on Day One, he or she will be dropped from the Day One tournament and will automatically be added to the Day Two tournament.
* Day Two is a brand-new tournament, with new tiebreakers, that includes all players who finished with 21 match points or greater in one of the two Day One flights.
* Players must play the same Modern deck on Day Two that they played on Day One.
* Day Two will consist of *seven* rounds of Swiss before a cut to the Top 8. *(Editor's Note: the number of rounds of Swiss has been lowered to seven since the original announcement.)*
* The three tournaments (both Day One tournaments and the Day Two tournament) will be reported as a single Grand Prix tournament.

**Pro Point Payouts for Grand Prix Milan**
