Vintage Cube Continues
----------------------


Drafting is already fun, but what if every pack you opened was made up entirely of superpowered cards drawn from the entire history of *Magic*? That's what you get with Vintage Cube. [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) out a [Blightsteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus), draft the full suite of original Moxen, play a five-color storm deck—do whatever your heart desires! This cube has it all.


Vintage Cube runs through July 6. To see the full card list and the most recent changes, go [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).

MOCS Open June 30
-----------------


Saturday, June 30, there will be a *Magic Online* Championship Series Open Event beginning at 7 a.m. PT. The format is *Dominaria* Sealed Deck, and players may join with 40 Event Tickets or 400 Play Points. The winner will qualify for the 2018 *Magic Online* Championship as well as Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica* in the fall.

Team Standard Super League Tonight
----------------------------------


The latest offering in our roster of Team Super League shenanigans is Team Standard Super League. The format is a bit different from the "Conqueror" rules used for TMSL and TVSL, but the basics are the same: team-wide deck-building restrictions, rotating players, and weekly elimination tournaments. See what kinds of crazy brews these teams bring to the table in the world of *Dominaria* Standard!


TSSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).




---

Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!



TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).
