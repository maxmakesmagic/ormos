Member of England's World Magic Cup team in 2015.

I would want my friend, Pro Tour competitor Ed Hughes, to have been here. He passed away on Tuesday and I dedicate this to him.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


The eight [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb)s.

### Giuseppe Reale

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Top 8 at the Rochester Draft Grand Prix in Paris.


**What deck did you play and why?**


[Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End), because it's well-positioned in the metagame.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Add one [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) to the main deck, remove [Ricochet Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap) from the sideboard.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage).

**Age:** 33


**Occupation:** Magic shop


**Hometown:** Massa, Italy

Top 4 at Grand Prix Turin, Top 4 at Grand Prix Utrecht.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Bant Company. Cammilluzzi gave me a good list, and with some changes it became the greatest deck!

Nothing. Or maybe add another [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique).

[Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage).

### Alberto Mattioli


**Age:** 22


**Occupation:** Mechanic


**Hometown:** Piacenza, Italy


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Some minor Grand Prix finishes.


**What deck did you play and why?**


I chose White-Blue Eldrazi because the Eldrazi are really unfair.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I would change nothing.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) by far.

### Jaroslav Boucek


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Magic player/traveler


**Hometown:** Samotišky, Czech Republic


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Top 8 at Grand Prix Lille, Top 32 at Grand Prix Rimini, some Top 64s.


**What deck did you play and why?**


White-Blue Eldrazi. It's busted, way too good and consistent to be Modern legal.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Definitely add something to the sideboard. Probably Ulamog and maybe [Stubborn Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stubborn+Denial). I saw way more [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End)s floating around than I expected.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple)/[Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin).

Affinity. I don't trust the Eldrazi.

None.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


All of them.

### Mattia Rizzi


**Age:** 22

This season, Top 8 at Grand Prix Prague and ninth at Grand Prix Lyon. Top 8 at Grand Prix Portland 2013. Silver level pro status.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Red-Green Eldrazi, because Fabrizio Anteri told me that it's the best deck in this metagame.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I don't like [Matter Reshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matter+Reshaper). I would like to replace it with another card.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin), for sure!

### Fabrizio Anteri


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Soon-to-be Platinum pro player


**Hometown:** London, England


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Won back to back GPs in 2014 and just won the last Grand Prix I played. I'm just saying.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Red-Green Eldrazi. Good friend and giocatore fortissimo [MVP] Humberto Patarca gave me his list and convinced me to work together to improve it. Great choice! Thanks, bro!


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Maybe cut the [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) for a [Warping Wail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warping+Wail) to beat [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End), which seems to be one of the best non-Eldrazi options.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker).
