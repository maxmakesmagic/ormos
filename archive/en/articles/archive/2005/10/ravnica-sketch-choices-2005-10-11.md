Once a **Magic** artist has read the art description of a card-to-be, his or her first job is to submit one or more sketches of his or her vision of that art description. When the artist submits more than one, it's the job of the **Magic** art director to choose which direction would look best on the finished card.


How closely does your artistic eye match the art director's? Can you tell which of these submitted sketches ended up on the finished *Ravnica* card?


*For each pair of sketches, decide which one ended up on the finished card. Click one side or the other to reveal whether you guessed right.*
