Eldritch Moon Update Bulletin
=============================

By Matt Tabak




Matt Tabak is the reigning, defending, and undisputed rules manager for Magic: The Gathering, Kaijudo, and Duel Masters. Matt Tabak is Gruul. Matt Tabak tries to laugh, think, and cry every day. Matt Tabak is hungry. Matt Tabak doesn't want you to sass him. Matt Tabak loves puppies.
 






Whether you're a diehard Melvin or just rules-curious, new *Magic* sets can be pretty exciting. There are new abilities to enshrine in the rules and tweaks galore to the existing rules, and some cards in Oracle get shiny new text. And this article summarizes it all. Welcome to the Update Bulletin.


In the previous edition of this series, I mentioned that Eli Shiffrin had joined the rules team. This update brings even more changeâ€”he's now a full-fledged rules manager. Exciting! I'm fully embracing the greener pastures of editing and dipping my toes in the icy waters of brand management. I'll still be a mostly trusted member of the templating team, and you'll still hear from me in the form of mechanics articles and Spotlight videos. It's been a pleasure serving you. Please come again.


Now, on to the changes!
