 Q: Where is the podcast? 


**A: Trick Jarrett, DailyMTG.com Editor-in-Chief & DailyMTGCast Host**


There has been a plague circulating the Wizards offices and it took hold of the podcast last week such that we weren't able to record. We'll be back as soon as we can get the next episode recorded and edited (meaning: next week!).


 Q: Why isn't the podcast weekly? â€”Jackson 


**A: Trick Jarrett, DailyMTG.com Editor-in-Chief & DailyMTGCast Host**


I'd love to make the podcast run weekly but the problem is twofold:


1. I'm always worried about overusing internal content. There's a feeling that we'll always have interesting stories and people to talk to internally, but that's not necessarily true. Sure, we can talk to Mark Rosewater every week, but that's not true for every other member of R&D.
2. There is a time commitment involved, not only in recording it but also in taking several hours to edit the episode. We record roughly an extra half hour to allow plenty of wiggle space with editing and trying to ensure the topics carry us through the episode. Unfortunately, my time for editing is a real limited factor.

I do, however, want to make the podcast a weekly feature. It's just a matter of finding the system to support that, whether by finding someone to offload the editing to or doing something else.


Thanks for listening, Jackson!
