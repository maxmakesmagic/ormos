Things started out crazy this weekend in Atlanta: an airport security breach forced many players and staff to arrive late (or in some cases not at all), but once things got into a familiar groove, the tournament played out fantastically.


After 13 rounds of Swiss and a hard-fought Top 8, Team CMU showed their mastery of the *Odyssey* limited format again, this time placing two members in the final match of the Grand Prix: US National Team member Eugene Harvey and Andrew Johnson of Car Acrobatic Team fame.


In the end, it was Harvey who was victorious, his blue/white deck proving too powerful for Johnson's red/green beats, but I'm sure it's all the same to the two of them. Who better to lose to than your roommate?


In other news, it appears that the invitations to Pro Tour San Diego dropped down as far as 18th place due to the star power around the top of the standings. So many people will head home from Atlanta winners this weekend.


I hope everyone enjoyed the fine coverage on the Sideboard this weekend, thanks in no small part to the hard work of dedicated **Magic** players like Eric Taylor, Brian Kowal, Kurt Hahn, Ben Bleiweiss, David Jafari, and Joshua Claytor, among many others. My thanks go out to them, and with that, I'm signing off from lovely Atlanta, Georgia.
