 After three rounds of *Kaladesh* Draft at the Super Sunday Series Championship, five players remained undefeated and in a great position going into the four rounds of Modern that were awaiting them.



The first player to lock up his 3-0 record was New Zealand's Jason Chung, who quickly wrapped up under the feature match lights. His deck gave him a total of six games across three matches.

"You have to be very proactive in this format," Chung explained. "My deck had a lot of removal and had cards that are only really good if you are attacking." In this case, [Built to Smash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Built+to+Smash) and creatures like [Bomat Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier) were an example of that, and the Courier got some sick value in that Round 3 match.


Andrea Mengucci wrapped up his feature match not too long after that, showcasing a deck that presented two highlights that he was more than happy to display.

He explained that his draft deck was short on playable creatures, and thus he was left with some rather questionable gremlins to fill out a deck that otherwise had a lot of powerful stuff going on, despite the glaring holes.


The next 3-0 was Shin'ya Saito, who wrapped up his match against Ivan Jen in the third round.

"Saito's deck was too good," Jen said, and he wasn't wrong, as Saito sported a very powerful white-blue deck with [Cataclysmic Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cataclysmic+Gearhulk), multiple big threats on the top end, and plenty of early game stall to get there.


Shortly after that, the results between Qi Wentao and Gianmaria Ruggiu came in, with Ruggiu coming out on top.

Ruggiu's Red-White deck was blunt and to the point, with a relatively low curve, lots of removal, and some hard-hitting vehicles.



 And finally, Mamoru Nagai was one of the last matches to conclude in Round 3, as his match against Yuki Mitsunaga went very long. He ultimately prevailed, making him the fifth and final 3-0 at the end of *Kaladesh* Draft.

Nagai's deck was a very solid black-green build featuring plenty of +1/+1 counter synergies.


These five players had a nice lead going into the four rounds of Modern for today. Would their leads hold, as Modern propels them to the Top 8? Or would a rough metagame call leave them tumbling?
