Hélène Bergeot started her career with Wizards of the Coast in France in December, 1995; afterwards, she spent a few years in the European headquarters based in Belgium and eventually relocated to the Renton office. She is currently the director of organized play and trade marketing. 





Due to major changes in how Pro Points are awarded this season to players, we have decided to reexamine our [Pro Players Club](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-players-club) thresholds mid-season to evaluate whether the new system is working as intended. During this re-evaluation, we have determined that the difficulty of achieving Platinum status is harder than intended with the new system.



As a result, we are reducing the threshold required for Platinum status from 48 Pro Points to 46.



This change is effective immediately. There will be no changes made to Silver and Gold Pro Player Club thresholds.
