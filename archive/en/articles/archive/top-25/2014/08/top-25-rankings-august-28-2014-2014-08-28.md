Welcome to our latest look at a busy week in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. There were two Grand Prix last weekend, and both had an impact on the standings.



In [Sydney](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsyd14http:/magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsyd14), the format was *Magic 2015* Limited. Given that [Kōbe](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpkob14) was the location for the other Grand Prix, it seemed at least possible that none of our Top 25 would put in an appearance. In the event, three intrepid travelers took their chance to see one of the world's iconic cities and participate in a weekend of Sealed and Draft. Jacob Wilson made it to the Draft portion of the event on Day Two, finishing up with a rock-solid 11–4 record, enough for a single pro point. Fellow Canadian standout Alexander Hayne missed out, ending Day One on 6–3. As a result, Hayne falls two spots to No. 18 and Wilson rises to No. 15,.



Meanwhile, Kobe was the home for more than 2,000 players packing Modern decks as their weapons of choice. The undoubted rankings star of the weekend was Yuuki Ichikawa. Making it onto the Sunday stage of [Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptjou14) was impressive. Repeating the feat at [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15) was extraordinary. Now he has opened his Grand Prix Top 8 account, and in doing so is easily the biggest mover of the week, up seven places to No. 7. Further down the standings, Lee Shi Tian delivered another strong weekend and gains a single pro point, and two places, as a result.



Next up, Salt Lake City plays host to a Limited Grand Prix the first weekend in September. In the meantime, join us next week for another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
