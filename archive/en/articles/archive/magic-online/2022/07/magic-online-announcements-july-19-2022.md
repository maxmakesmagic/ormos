Showcase Challenge Weekends
---------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend.


These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and, starting with this season, invitations to the 2023 World Championship!


First up this Saturday, July 23, we have the Modern Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC), and on Sunday, July 24, we have the Pioneer Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC).


Then the following week we finish things off on Saturday, July 30, with the Pauper Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00) and on Sunday, July 31, with the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00).


Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in August.
