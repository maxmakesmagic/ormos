![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/tour2.jpg)*It still took close to an hour but finally we arrived.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/tour3.jpg)*Everyone converges on the Convention Center. Thankfully the Lakers stunk this season, or this could have been a real headache with the playoffs. The Staples Center is across the street.*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/tour5.jpg)*The wait was not over for people who did not get badges ahead of time.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/tour6.jpg)*Fortunately for the players they were able to zip right up the escalators…*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/tour7.jpg)*…past shiny objects…*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/tour8.jpg)*…through the entrance to the West Hall…*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/osypdance.jpg)*Osyp breaks out the dancing shoes. Is a "virtual" Salsa challenge against Pierre Canali in the near future?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/kurodaking.jpg)*What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/osypandfriend.jpg)*Ah, the life of a professional card player.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/apac.jpg)*Kuroda, Fujita and Soh finished atop the standings, once again showing the power of the APAC region.*
