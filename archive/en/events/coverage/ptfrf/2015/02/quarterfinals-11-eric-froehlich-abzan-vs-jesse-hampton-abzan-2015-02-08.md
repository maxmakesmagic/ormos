Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





It's been a long strange trip for Jesse Hampton. His journey started a few months ago; Hampton agreed to play the Team Limited Grand Prix in Nashville with his close friends Matthew Nass and fifteenth-ranked Jacob Wilson. After missing a connecting flight to get there, Hampton rented a car and drove through the night. He barely made it in time to play in the first round. When all was said and done though, Nass, Wilson, and Hampton hoisted trophies in the air and Hampton was qualified for the Pro Tour.


Hampton is the definition of raw talent. This is his second Pro Tour Top 8 and, by his own admission, he didn't practice at all for either event. It's clear that Hampton thrives at the highest levels of competition.


His opponent, Eric Froehlich, is widely considered the best *Magic* player in the world by other professionals. With this Top 8, Froehlich has, astoundingly, already locked up Platinum status in the Pro Players Club for the coming year. This Top 8 all but secures Froehlich's Hall of Fame berth in the coming year. Coming off a Grand Prix victory last weekend in San Jose, Froehlich is white hot and very capable of proving his talents on the game's biggest stage.

The Games
=========


Froehlich led things off with [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). He carefully wrote down all the cards in Hampton's hand and thought about his options before choosing to take [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), the only threat for Hampton.


Hampton fired back with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to pick a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) from Froehlich's grip.


[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) came off the top for Froehlich and he followed it up with [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) on the next turn, by far the most important card for Game 1 in the Modern Abzan mirror match.


Froehlich started attacking without resistance and added another copy of [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) before using the flashback on his [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls).


[Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township) on the following turn put Hampton in an awkward spot. Froehlich's army of spirits and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s would start growing with each turn. All Hampton could do was activate [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood) and use [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) to deal with one of Froehlich's [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/ptfrf/qf1_froehlich.jpg)  



Hampton couldn't find the necessary [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) to stay alive and Froehlich made a lethal attack on the following turn.


It's clear that [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) is important in the Abzan mirror. [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township) lets a player win the [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) war and has been one of the most important pieces of technology to come out of this weekend. This first game provided a vivid illustration of card's importance in the match-up.


In the second game, it was Hampton's opportunity to play first. Both players kept their opening hands and Hampton fired off a turn one [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to take a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) out of Froehlich's hand.


Again, Froehlich found [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) on the top of his deck and deployed it on the second turn. [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) was next again, and things were shaping up in an eerily similar manner to the prior game.


Hampton had [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) to get back into the game, but Froehlich had [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) and used the [Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash)back on [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) after attacking for another six damage.


Hampton tapped his hand on the table. "You're just a [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) master," he said.


Again, things were looking grim for Hampton. Froehlich had an airforce of four spirits alongside a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and Hampton could only play another [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). It wasn't the worst card he could draw in that spot, but he would need a [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) or [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) of his own if he wanted to keep up.


Again, [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township) came down and Froehlich sent his team at Hampton. Hampton had [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) for Froehlich's [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), but now Froehlich's spirit army was growing and threatened to attack for lethal on the following turn.


It was Hampton's turn to be lucky as he found the perfect card, [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse), on the top of his deck. The versatile removal opting cleared Froehlich's board and left only Hampton's [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) in play.

Hampton advanced his board-state further with Tasigur, The Golden Fang. Suddenly, things were looking very good for Hampton.


Froehlich tried to get back in the game with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), but Hampton had [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and his attack with [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang), [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), and [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood)s on the following turn would be enough to force a third game.


In the third game, Hampton kicked things off with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to take [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) out of Froehlich's hand.


Froehlich played [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and, once again, it looked like he would be the early aggressor in the match-up.


Hampton had [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) to deal with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) was next at bat for Froehlich.


Hampton played a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) of his own, but it was quite bad in the face of Froehlich's [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Froehlich's [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) dealt with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) gobbled up a pair of creatures to become a 4/4 before he attacked with it.


Hampton also had [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), but the card is significantly weaker when an opponent already has one in play being activated. Froehlich used [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and another activation from [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) to attack for five.


But when each player had a fifth turn [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), it seemed like the game could go very long.


Hampton settled in his chair. "This happened in testing. We had one game that went on for well over an hour before we decided to just stop playing."


Hampton had [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) for [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) and it seemed as though he was able to pull ahead when he returned [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) to his hand to recast with a fresh germ token.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/ptfrf/qf1_froehlich2.jpg)  



Froehlich was able to equip [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) with his own [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) to win the race, but Hampton found [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) and quickly latched his [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) on to a Spirit token.


Froehlich had a [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) of his own and the game looked like it might last forever with each player gaining life by attacked the other so as to remain at parity.


"We both gain five," started to become a common saying.


Here, Froehlich had a number of turns where he could have drawn [Zealous Persecution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Persecution) to simply win the game. It wasn't meant to be, though, and the life totals quickly swelled out of reach while the tokens traded.


Once again, neither player had an out to simply win the game without resistance.


Hampton continued to get in with [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) on Spirit after Spirit. His life total swelled well above twenty.


Froehlich was doing the same. Each cycle of turns, Hampton was gaining ten life while Froehlich was gaining five. This may seem like its hugely in Hampton's favor, but there's very little one could do about it given the situation.


The life totals continued to rise as each player continued to attack with spirits equipped with [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


Froehlich ran out of spirits and tried to go a bit bigger when he had enough land to equip [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) with [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


Parity was finally broken when [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) came down for Hampton. Froehlich had [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) and immediately used the minus two ability to get rid of Hampton's [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull)-equipped Spirit token, but it seemed like his options were running out.


In the coming turns, Hampton started activating [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) to get back seemingly endless amounts of gas from his graveyard. Froehlich saw no way out and was forced to concede.


**Jesse Hampton defeats Eric Froehlich 2-1 and advances to the semifinals!**
