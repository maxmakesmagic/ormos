Here's the art description for *Planeshift*'s [Mogg Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mogg%2BSentry):


> This card represents Red magic. The image must include at least one major element that is Red.  
>  Location: Stronghold  
>  A big, burly mogg leans against a large pike presumably guarding a Stronghold door. He ain’t moving.

And here's Edward P. Beard's painting:

*[Mogg Sentry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mogg%2BSentry) art by Edward P. Beard, Jr.*Now here's the art description for [Mogg Jailer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Jailer), also from *Planeshift*:


> This card represents Red magic. The image must include at least one major element that is Red.  
>  Location: Stronghold  
>  A big, burly mogg leans against a large pike presumably guarding a Stronghold door. He ain’t moving.

Mark Romanoski turned this in:

*[Mogg Jailer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Jailer) art by Mark Romanoski*So what happened? Well, there was a mix-up in the art assignment stage, and the same card was assigned to two different artists. And both of them turned in good pieces, so the team went ahead and let the moggs have a sentry *and* a jailer.
