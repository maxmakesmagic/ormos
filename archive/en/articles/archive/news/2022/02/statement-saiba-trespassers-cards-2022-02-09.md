It has come to our attention that the English printed version of Saiba Trespassers from *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* does not list the appropriate creature type.

Their creature type is Moonfolk Rogue, which will be reflected correctly in all other languages, on *Magic: The Gathering Arena*, and on *Magic Online*.
