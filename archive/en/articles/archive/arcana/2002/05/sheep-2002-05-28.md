The *Visions* card [Ovinomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ovinomancer) turns creatures into 0/1 sheep tokens (at quite a hefty cost). This card is a tribute to the Blizzard computer game [*Warcraft*](http://www.blizzard.com/war1/), in which the spell Polymorph turns opposing units into sheep. The game was an R&D favorite during the *Visions* design period.
