![Spike Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spike+Feeder)Literally thousands of man-seconds of labor have gone into bringing you this, a snapshot-style view of the Day 1 metagame of Grand Prix - New Orleans. Of course, with sixty decktypes being played across nearly four hundred competitors, full disclosure is impossible. However, all the statistics are there, eager for your perusal. What follows is a glimpse of the most-represented archetypes.**The Rock - 68**

As the saying goes, "Good ol' Rock. Nothing beats that." Plenty of early game to stem beatdown decks (with Spike Feeders helping to give Sligh fits), and then some of the biggest spells you've ever seen. Vampiric Tutor lets it run single copies of game-enders like Haunting Echoes, Recurring Nightmare and Living Death. Living Wish augments this. It can also play a strong disruptive game with Duress, Cabal Therapy and Dust Bowl. Certainly the mirror is all about mana control. Mid-range control decks are always a good choice against a varied field, and as you see below, there's plenty of variance here. 

**Blue-Green Madness - 60**

Ah, OBC, we thought we'd said goodbye to you. The standard madness package of enablers, undercosted creatures and Circular Logic is joined by such forgotten hits as Waterfront Bouncer and the disastrous Intuition. This deck was first championed by Jeff Cunningham at Houston, where he finished in the twenties. He was mocked, but after some serious success on the PTQ circuit, and particularly after Reims turned players on to Red Deck Wins, players are realising that the power of madness works even at this level. It probably doesn't hurt that it's pretty straightforward to play. There are a number of variations, and the spectrum starts to blend into more dedicated Tradewind builds as you see versions that run the abusive Gilded Drake - Waterfront Bouncer combination.

**Psychatog - 37**

![Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Psychatog)The surprise contender this weekend is Psychatog. The power of "Intuition for Accumulated Knowledge" is not to be denied. This deck has moved away from the quick-kill versions that sport Gush, in favor of more early game to combat the deluge of blue-green. Cunning Wish gives outstanding versatility, and there are good post-board answers for most of the decks out there. **Oath - 33**

What can you say? It won the Pro Tour for a reason. This number includes Gary-style Oaths, as well as some more arcane Battlefield Scrounger versions. The combination of Oaths and Pernicious Deeds give creature decks nightmares. The heavy Psychatog attendance should give them problems, though. 

**Red Deck Wins - 22**

Thought to be metagamed out of existence after taking Grand Prix - Reims by storm, the combination of mountain, Jackal Pup is a hard one to put down. It seems unlikely that they'll be able to dodge hate through fourteen rounds, though, but a string of favorable matchups could put them in a position where they'll only meet decks they're designed to beat. 

**Aluren - 10**

![Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aluren)Another deck that's disappeared but not quite. It made a big splash at Houston, but hasn't really been up to snuff since then. Whether it's because of the increased reliance on Duress, or the fact that most everyone knows how the deck works, it seems like no-one fears this deck anymore. These ten will be hard pressed to prove otherwise.**Benzo - 10**

The disciples of Dougherty take this page from his Houston performance. But with so many Gilded Drakes in attendance, anyone but the man himself will be hard pressed to push through with a straight-up reanimation strategy. Definitely not a deck you want to pick up and run. 

**The Five-and-Betters - 86**

Spanning fourteen decktypes, these decks showcase the possibilities that run rampant in Extended. They might not all be Tier 1 decks, but they bring a good game to the table. It's surprising to see Blue-Green Opposition on this list, but there are a lot of expecteds as well, such as Ghoul Burst, Draco-Explosion, Angry Hermit Part II, and Fiends. Traditional Goblin Sligh ranks way down here, outclassed by RDW2K2.
