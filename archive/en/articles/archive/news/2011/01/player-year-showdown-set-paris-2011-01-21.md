Brad Nelson and Guillaume Matignon will battle at [**Magic**  Weekend Paris](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/magicweekend/paris11) in a best-of-seven match featuring Constructed and Limited formats for the honor of joining such luminaries as Kai Budde, Jon Finkel, Gabriel Nassif, and Kenji Tsumura as the Pro Tour Player of the Year.


The showdown will take place Saturday, February 12 starting at 9 a.m., during the three-round bye period of Grand Prix Paris. Here's how the schedule breaks down:


* Games 1-2: Standard
* Games 3-4: Double Sealed Deck
* Game 5\*: Double Sealed Deck
* Games 6-7\*: Standard

 \* if necessary


Both players will use the same decks they played in the Standard portion of Pro Tour Paris. The Double Sealed Deck portion will consist of six *Scars of Mirrodin*  booster packs and six *Mirrodin Besieged*  booster packs.


Wizards of the Coast R&D and events staff reviewed multiple formats before deciding on Standard and Sealed Deck. One of the main considerations was allowing Nelson and Matignon to prepare for the Pro Tour and this match at the same time, rather than forcing them to work on two different Constructed formats.


"The challenge of traditional Sealed Deck play is to make the most of what cards you get. Doubling the card pool will allow the Player of the Year candidates more opportunities to display creativity and cleverness," said **Magic: The Gathering**  developer Tom LaPille. "We look forward to seeing what kind of 40-card decks they build with the embarrassment of riches they will be given."
