Ludvig Londos vs. Brad Nelson
-----------------------------


Coming in to Round 8, both Ludvig Londos and Brad Nelson were undefeated, having navigated a dangerous table 1 pod including Brian Kibler, Kai Budde and Guillaume Wafo Tapa. While Brad is now accustomed to the lights of the feature match arena, his opponent Ludvig Londos may have been a little tired after grinding in in last night's Last Chance Qualifier, which ran well past midnight.


### Game 1


Both players kept, and it was Nelson who got in the first play of the game with a [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). He had a little "Caw!" as Londos dropped a [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) onto the table, finding two more. Nelson let out a laugh and another caw as he cast [Prodigal Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer). These birds would not fly for long.


"Did you go to Gothenburg last weekend?" asked Londos.


"Nah, I stayed home, chilled, had a good time." Brad looked fairly chilled and was having a good time in the feature match arena.

Londos played out a [Cloud Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental), and got a single hit in with his Hawk before it was shot down in flames. Brad had a [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur) to start attacking with, and looked pretty happy with his position.


An [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) provided the next attacker for Nelson, letting a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) nip in hastily for more damage. While Londos had a [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), it looked a little impotent in the face of the power on the other side of the board. Londos dug with [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), then played an [Augury Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), looking for answers. Brad, meanwhile, had a new plan for his [Prodigal Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) if he ever ran out of targets on the other side of the board. [Protean Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hydra) came down, with X=3. It could easily grow thanks to his pinger.


[Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) on [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) was a brutal main-deck answer to the flyer, and with just a few swift swings, Brad Nelson put himself one game away from a perfect score for the day.

"So, are you jetlagged from travelling from the USA?" asked Londos.


"No," replied Brad. "I love to sleep. I have been sleeping all the time."


"I didn't get to sleep until 3 a.m."


"Why not?"


"I was qualifying for this Pro Tour."


"Maaaaaaaaan! I can't beat you now! Grinder goes to 8-0? What a story!"


### Game 2


The next game started with [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion) for Londos, while Nelson started with [Goblin Piker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker). Stuck on just [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, Nelson had little follow-up, while Londos played [Augury Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), and [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) finding two more.


"I once had a deck with four [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s and a [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) in this format. That was a *fun* deck," remarked Nelson, who eventually drew a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) to allow for some Llanoawar Elves.


[Prodigal Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) from Nelson was soon shut down by an [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage), but there was little Londos could do about [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion), which was a clear and present danger to his team of Birds.


Londos, however, was far from out of it. A [Vengeful Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Archon) from Londos met a small harrumph from Nelson, who tapped out for a 5/5 [Protean Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hydra). It got bounced by [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), and it was on to Game 3.

### Game 3


A quick keep came from Brad on the play, while Ludwig shuffled his hand nervously before starting with seven. Londos's turn-two [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) was so eager to get its friends that Londos ended up having to discard, dropping a [Siege Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon) in the bin. Nelson again had the trump in [Prodigal Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer), and soon followed up with [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) to launch into the ground and pound.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/r8_nelson.jpg)*Let it never be said that Brad Nelson is not a man who loves to sleep.*


After a little thought for his turn (and an attack that ate a [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)), Brad cast a [Fauna Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman). He looked on as [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) came down for Londos, and calmly cast a [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) on his next turn that, along with Pyromancer, tag-teamed to take the Angel down.


Attacks soon had Londos at 5, and when he tried again for a [Vengeful Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Archon), Brad had quite the response.


"[Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) my [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) at you?"


That will do.


Nelson 2, Londos 1


Both players then slunk off for a nap—Londos because he needed it, and Brad just because he likes to sleep.


Brad Nelson wins 2-1, advancing to 8-0 going into Saturday.
