Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






 This weekend is players' last chance to play a major Standard event before the release of Fate Reforged. Coming into this weekend, Standard seemed to have oscillated to a place where decks that took full advantage of [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant) and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) were becoming a dominant force. This weekend marks the return of Abzan as the deck to beat. Of the archetypes in Day 2, three different Abzan variants account for three of the four most well-represented decks. Let's take a look at the metagame breakdown for the second day of competition here in Denver.
