Welcome to the *Lorwyn* Block edition of the [Lexicon](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=lexicon), in which we explore the meanings of some of the more obscure words we use in the names of those cards. While many offbeat names in **Magic** (like “[Squeaking-Pie Grubfellows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squeaking-Pie%2BGrubfellows)”) are simply made up, we often dig around dictionaries for real little-used and archaic words for inspiration.

![Stonybrook Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stonybrook+Banneret)**ban•ner•et**  
*noun*

1. A small banner.
2. A feudal knight ranking between a knight bachelor and a baron, who was entitled to lead men into battle under his own standard.

![Cairn Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cairn+Wanderer)**cairn**  
*noun*

1. A mound of stones erected as a memorial or marker.

![Greatbow Doyen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Greatbow+Doyen)**doy•en**  
*noun*

1. A man who is the eldest or senior member of a group.

![Deglamer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deglamer)**glam•er** (also glam•our or glam•or)  
*noun*

1. An air of compelling charm, romance, and excitement, especially when delusively alluring.
2. *Archaic.* A magic spell; enchantment.

![Lammastide Weave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lammastide+Weave)**lam•mas**  
*noun*

1. 1. A feast formerly celebrated in England, during which bread from the season's first wheat was consecrated at Mass in thanksgiving for the harvest.
	2. A feast formerly celebrated in commemoration of Saint Peter's deliverance from prison.
2. August 1, the day on which these feasts were celebrated.

![Stingmoggie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stingmoggie)**mog•gie**  
*noun*

1. **Moggy** or **moggie** (plural **moggies**) is a British affectionate term for a domestic cat, but is also used as alternative name for a mongrel or mixed-breed cat whose ancestry and pedigree are unknown or only partially known. Because of this mixed ancestry and free-breeding, a moggy can either be very healthy, or, if from an inbred feral colony, genetically unsound and sickly. However, as feral colonies are often left without any form of human intervention and veterinary attention, the sickly generally do not live past kittenhood, leaving the colony as a whole healthy.

![Violet Pall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Violet+Pall)**pall**  
*noun*

1. A cover for a coffin, bier, or tomb, often made of black, purple, or white velvet.
2. A coffin, especially one being carried to a grave or tomb.
3. 1. A covering that darkens or obscures: *a pall of smoke over the city.*
	2. A gloomy effect or atmosphere: *"A pall of depressed indifference hung over Petrograd during February and March 1916"* (W. Bruce Lincoln).

![Plover Knights](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Plover+Knights)**plov•er**  
*noun*

1. Any of various widely distributed wading birds of the family Charadriidae, having rounded bodies, short tails, and short bills.
2. Any of various similar or related birds.

![Eyes of the Wisent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eyes+of+the+Wisent)**wi•sent**  
*noun*

1. The European bison (*Bison bonasus*) having a smaller and higher head than the North American bison.
