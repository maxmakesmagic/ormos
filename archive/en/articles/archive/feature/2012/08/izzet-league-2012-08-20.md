Izzet League
**My Ingenuity. My Obsession. My Guild.**
The Izzet are obsessive experimenters, the epitome of keen creative intellect combined with an unfortunately short attention span. The original mandate of the Izzet guild was to provide solutions for public works projects (sewers, boilers, roadways), but their experiments often produce mana geysers, spatial rifts, or arcane portals instead. As of late, their guildmaster, the dragon Niv-Mizzet, has driven the Izzet to delve deeper and deeper into more dangerous and experimental magic. The purpose of these experiments is unknown.

**Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind.** Niv-Mizzet, the leader and original parun of the Izzet League, is an ancient, vain, temperamental, and super-intelligent dragon. Niv-Mizzet rarely stoops to concern himself with the day-to-day running of the guild, preferring to craft long-range plans and let his underlings implement the details. Niv-Mizzet uses his personal court, the Izmundi, to guide his machinations and to keep him abreast of the happenings in the wider world. The Izmagnus are the most powerful members of the Izmundi, which typically has five to seven members, including some whose identities are kept secret. Even members of the Izmagnus are not privy to Niv-Mizzet’s highest-level plans and goals.

**Nivix, Aerie of the Firemind.** Nivix is the home of Niv-Mizzet and the central guildhall of the Izzet. Nivix is a massive tower, comparable in size to New Prahv. Every level of the tower houses Izzet alchemists, mages, and sages who are constantly theorizing, experimenting, and tossing miscalculated experiments across rooms. The very top of the tower is of course the aerie of Niv-Mizzet himself. Though none of the experimentations of the tower’s residences seem connected, the great dragon treats them all as if they were part of one grand experiment.
