A.J. Sacher shares his Extended build of [Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph+)  that turns faerie and plant tokens into [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn). Nice upgrade! A deck list will be provided after the event.
