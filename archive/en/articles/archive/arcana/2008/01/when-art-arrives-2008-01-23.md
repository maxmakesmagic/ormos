It's always exciting when art starts to arrive at the Wizards of the Coast offices. All of a sudden, walls that were once bare and uninspiring bristle with the first images of the new set.

Now, obviously we can't show you what the art wall looks like right now (although you might be interested to know that the future looks *awesome*), but we can give you a peek at what it looked like when the *Lorwyn* art started showing up.

![The Wall of Art](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1510_Wall.jpg)Let's take a closer look at some of these pieces!

![Knucklebone Witch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1510_Knucklebone.jpg)This is Jim Pavelec's [Knucklebone Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knucklebone+Witch) art. There's also a bit of Omar Rayyan's [Glen Elendra Pranksters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Pranksters) in the corner -- note that that's only a *printout* of the art down there, which is why it's taped to the wall.

![Changeling Hero and Wort, Boggart Auntie](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1510_Hero.jpg)Here, Jeff Miracola's [Changeling Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero) hangs out with Larry MacDougall's [Wort, Boggart Auntie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wort%2C+Boggart+Auntie).

![Swamp/Mountain Diptych](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1510_SwampMountain.jpg)You've seen Wayne Reynolds's Swamp/Mountain mural [before](/en/articles/archive/tenth-edition%E2%80%99s-preview-lorwyn-2007-08-07). But here's three of the *Lorwyn* two-land murals together:

![Land Diptychs](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1510_Diptychs.jpg)From top to bottom, that's Ron Spears (Swamp/Island), Larry MacDougal (Mountain/Plains), and Wayne Reynolds (Swamp/Mountain). They look pretty cool next to each other like that!
