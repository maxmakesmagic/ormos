Shipping and production delays will limit the availability of *Streets of New Capenna* products in Brazil for the upcoming Prerelease weekend. Stores can check with their local distributor for more information regarding their product schedule. Customers looking to take part in the Prerelease events this weekend should check with their local game stores for the latest status of those events.


All *Streets of New Capenna* product will be available in Brazil for the global launch as planned, except for English-language Commander decks, which will be delayed until later.
