With [Paris](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppar15) and [Atlantic City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpatc15) both playing host to Grand Prix last weekend, the Magic Top 25 Pro Rankings have shifted once more. Of the twelve ranked players who took part in Atlantic City, only five advanced their cause, but that still left room for some significant successes. Alexander Hayne, who has done nothing but impress [since he burst onto the Pro Tour scene with his win at Pro Tour Avacyn Restored](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/day-magic-insanity-2015-05-13), found his way to yet another Grand Prix Top 8, and the only surprise was that he was stopped from snaring yet another trophy. It took Christian Calcano, our new No. 23, to do it in the final, but Hayne still moves up five to No. 19.


Joining them in an excellent Top 8 was Jacob Wilson. Plenty of new fans were following Wilson this weekend as his star continues to rise. He finished third in Atlantic City and is the highest climber this week, netting six places, up from No. 14 to No. 8. Just outside the Top 8 was Andrew Cuneo, who has quietly climbed the table since joining it earlier this season. He’s up three at No. 16, which helps him stay ahead of Ondrej Strasky, who picked up a couple of places at Grand Prix Paris.


Speaking of Paris, there’s a second new entry to our chart, and it’s a prestigious one at that. Antonio Del Moral Leon of Spain, recent Pro Tour Champion in Washington, D.C., finished third in Paris, and he heads an impressive group of Spanish players who are all around the top tables when it matters. He joins the ranks at No. 24, just behind Calcano.


Next it’s on to the Team format at Grand Prix Florence, and we know at least one dream team—consisting of William Jensen (No. 14), Reid Duke (No. 21), and Hall of Fame pro Ben Stark—will be in attendance, looking to dominate the team format. And on the other side of the world, Grand Prix Shanghai features Standard once again for players who wish to stick to a more traditional format. We’ll tell you how they, and all the rest of the best, got on when you join us next week for more from the Magic Top 25 Pro Rankings.
