*What unexpected places have you run into other **Magic** players?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** The short answer here is "Just about everywhere I've played **Magic** in public," which I guess means it's no longer all that unexpected, really. About the only exception is late-night drafting in hotel lobbies at big events, when there aren't many people passing through the lobby and the hotel staff are ignoring all these weird people moving their chairs into groups of eight.

My wife and I play a lot of **Magic** in public places, from cafes to restaurants to ferries. It's pretty common for a waiter or a passerby (or, every once in an adorable while, a small child) to stop and say, "Hey, is that **Magic**?" I've had people notice the cards, or even just the logo on a box tucked under my arm, in coffee shops, on airplanes, at the mall, and wherever else. Heck, our waitress at a burger joint a couple nights ago asked us what our favorite colors were.

But probably the most surreal places I've run into **Magic** fans are airport security, customs, and immigration.

**Officer:** Point of departure?  
**Me:** Paris.  
**Officer:** Reason for trip?  
**Me:** Uh, business.  
**Officer:** What sort of business?  
**Me:** (sigh) I was working on web coverage at a trading card game tournament.  
**Officer:** Oh, was that the **Magic** Pro Tour?  
**Me:** Yes!  
**Officer:** I was following it all weekend. The Top 8 was awesome!  
**Me:** (gapes)  
**Person Behind Me:** (\*ahem\*)  
**Officer:** Oh, uh, you're all set, sir. Welcome back.
