You've seen quite a bit of *Shadows over Innistrad* revealed so far (and if by some chance you haven't and you're reading this article, check out the [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/shadowsoverinnistrad)), which means you've also seen a lot of the token-creating cards in this set.


But you haven't seen the tokens. Unless you scrolled down and then came back to read this. Which...well, fair enough.


At any rate, let's take a look at the tokens of *Shadows over Innistrad*. First up, the creatures, some of which are completely new creations of Innistrad. The Angel is probably my favorite, but I'll admit they all look fantastic.

But, of course, Jace's search for answers wouldn't be complete without Clue tokens—six of them, to be exact. Clue 16, the one with Avacyn's stained glass, is particularly awesome.

Finally, you've met Jace, Unraveler of Secrets and fashionable collar-popper, as well as Arlinn Kord. Now, meet their emblems.

And that's it! Friday the full set will be revealed, and a week later comes Prerelease Weekend! If you haven't gotten properly hyped up yet, now would be a good time to do so.
