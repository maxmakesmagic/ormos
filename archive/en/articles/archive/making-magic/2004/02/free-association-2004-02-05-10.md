Clichés themselves often get a bad rap. Clichés are popular because they so succinctly get the point across. In **Magic** terms, it's like faulting a repeat. Tweaks are nice but as [history](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-history) has shown sometimes you just want the classic. (You know, like *A New Hope*.)
