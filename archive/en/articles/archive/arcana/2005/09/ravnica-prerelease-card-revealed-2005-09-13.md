So you're thinking about going to the [*Ravnica* prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases). You've seen the animated trailer and the [ads on Adult Swim](http://archive.wizards.com/playravnica/default.asp?dcmp=ILC-ASTV). What you've seen of the [set so far](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/rav) looks great.


You've just got one question: you know you'll be receiving a special alternate-art premium card from the set, but you don't know what it's going to be.

Of course, pictures on a computer screen can only simulate the actual experience of holding one of these in your hand. For that, you'll just have to come to a prerelease and get one for yourself.
