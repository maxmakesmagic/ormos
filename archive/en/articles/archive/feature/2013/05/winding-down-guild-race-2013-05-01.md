Since we returned to the plane of Ravnica, players have been choosing their guilds on [PlaneswalkingPoints.com](http://www.planeswalkerpoints.com). Hopefully you've allied yourself with your chosen guild (which should probably be Boros...) and since doing so, your points have been tallied as part of your guild. With those accrued points all ten guilds are in a race to see who will earn the most points! With the release of *Dragon's Maze* this visit to Ravnica begins to wind down and the end of this guild competition nears.

It's not too late for you to choose your guild and join the guild race! We know new players, or players who might be coming back to **Magic**, identify strongly with their guild and still want to ally themselves with their guild, so you can still do it! Visit [PlaneswalkerPoints.com](http://www.planeswalkerpoints.com), sign in with your DCI number, and then click the "Choose Your Guild" button.


With the guild race nearing its end we will be disabling the ability for players to change from one guild to another on **May 9th, 2013**. After that you're committed to your guild!
