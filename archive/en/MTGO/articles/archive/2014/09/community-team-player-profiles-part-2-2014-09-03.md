The community's champions have been chosen to represent them as the 2014 Community Team! The internet cheers and throws roses at their computer screens and the floors of their local game stores! The masses stomp, stomp, clap vigorously, all while chanting the names of those who will represent them in the 2014 Community Cup—a test of *Magic* skill against the heroic Wizards of the Coast Team. The Community Team adorns its armor with the crowd's favors and toss hankies to its most excited fans, resulting in a swoon each and every time. As we speak, the Community Team gathers from far and wide, journeying to a glimmering citadel, or perhaps an internet message board, to discuss its strategies.


Keep your eye on the site on August 20, August 27, September 3, and September 10. We'll be featuring player profiles for every player on both team rosters! Once profiles post, links will be added in the [profile directory](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/2014-community-cup-player-profiles-2014-08-18).


The last set of profiles comes out two days before the 2014 Community Cup begins on September 12! The gauntlet of 2014 Community Cup events will run from that Friday until Sunday, September 14. We'll have video coverage of all of the events running on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) too, so remember to tune in!


Here are the player profiles we're covering today!

Erin Campbell
**How do you feel you fit into the *Magic* community?**


I fit in as both a woman and a transgender woman, at that. I feel I represent two different communities who are quite active, when it comes to *Magic*, but who we might not see represented that often at events or in the community at large. I'm also the host of a successful interview-style podcast, called The Deck Tease, which I've been recording for two years.


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


I started playing *Magic* in the seventh grade, shortly after *Ice Age* came out.


**What drew you to the *Magic* community**


Before I started playing *Magic* again, shortly after *Dark Ascension* came out, I had been playing MMOs for six or seven years. I spent much of that time being tethered to my computer and not getting out very much. I missed social interaction with people I could see and touch. I wanted something more personal. I liked the fact that there were so many different kinds of events that you could travel to and people you could see regularly, because of the game. Eventually, you start to form this network, and if anyone needs to borrow a card, or needs a place to crash for the weekend of an event, you have got each other covered. It's pretty awesome.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


Even when I'm not playing *Magic*, I'm still doing things related to it, somehow. I'm either researching decklists, or watching streams, or working on my podcast. I can't really think of anything I do in my spare time which doesn't involve *Magic*.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


I just recently started playing a lot of Modern and I really love it. I have a lot of respect for the different cards and the win conditions that are out there. It's really neat watching certain decks "go off" or seeing cards that seemed really harmless when I was growing up be these real haymakers now.


**How long have you been playing *Magic*? How long have you been on *Magic Online*?**


I have been playing *Magic* since the seventh grade and I just turned thirty-one, so between fifteen and twenty years now. I started playing on *Magic Online* two or three years ago.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**


I'm a black mage at heart, with a fondness for board wipes. I get a strange feeling of joy from something like [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate), [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation), or [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith). I've been playing *Living End* for the past year in Modern, and still get a rush when I can clear the board that way.


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


Burn decks. I don't like the feeling of helplessness that comes from just having someone throw spells at your dome over and over. I don't have fun playing against those types of decks and have kind of given up trying to even beat them. It is what it is.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


Definitely black. I remember listening to Mark Rosewater's Drive to Work episode about the color black and found myself nodding along through the whole thing, and thinking "That is me." After that, I have some green elements to my personality and certainly some red aspects, too. There is a reason Jund is my favorite shard!


**What impact has the *Magic Online* community had on you?**


As someone who enjoys the competitive side of *Magic*, I like seeing the ways that the online meta shifts around so much. Because there are events happening constantly, people have to really be on their toes to stay on top of things. I love keeping up with the decklists that come out every day and seeing what spicy new tech folks are using. It's fun to take something you have seen online and bring it to your LGS or an event and see people be caught off guard by it, because it hasn't quite reached the paper metagame yet.


**How did you feel when you learned you’d been selected to be on the Community Team?**


I was completely flabbergasted and overwhelmed. To think that I started recording my podcast, The Deck Tease, a little over two years ago and now Trick Jarrett is personally inviting me to be part of the Community Cup. It's been a wild ride and I'm super grateful to be included.


**Have you been to Wizards before? What do you expect to find behind our locked doors?**


I have not been to Wizards before. I expect to meet a bunch of really smart and talented people who I could perhaps convince to come on my podcast and let me interview them some time!


**What are you doing to prepare for the Community Cup?**


I'll most likely be getting together with friends through *Magic Online* and Skype and practicing whenever I can. Everything has happened so fast. I'm not even sure what formats I need to prepare for!


**What is your favorite movie and TV show?**


One of my favorite movies of all time is *Closer*, with Clive Owen and Julia Roberts. My favorite TV show is a toss-up between *Orphan Black* and RuPaul's *Drag Race*.


**Who would you want to play you in a movie about your life?**


Emma Stone.


**What is your favorite food?**


Chinese.


**If you had a theme song play every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


'Infinity Guitars," by Sleigh Bells.


**Which Planeswalker would you want as a roommate?**


Liliana!



Mariah Pagliocco
**How do you feel you fit into the *Magic* community?**


Everyone fits into the *Magic* community; it's a very accepting and caring community. I'm not sure how anyone couldn't fit into our community.


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


First tournament was Arizona State Championships in 2006 when I was 9. I got back into the game in 2011 when we moved to the New England area.


**What drew you to the *Magic* community?**


My dad had played for years and I just grew into the game and community.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


Art, knitting, MMORPGs, *Werewolf*, and games in general.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


My favorite format is Sealed because I like how you have to think out of the box when deck building.


**How long have you been playing *Magic*? How long have you been on *Magic Online*?**


Competitively since 2011, same goes for *Magic Online*.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**


Whatever card qualifies me for a Pro Tour someday.


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


Combo decks because of the lack of interaction.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


Black and white because I'm a Panda!


**What impact has the *Magic Online* community had on you?**


When I got in my accident, the *Magic* community as a whole put their arms around me and helped inspire me to keep going with my rehab, to never quit, and to not lose. It was just like a PTQ, you keep going even if the day is long and just not allow yourself to slow down until you've won the whole thing.


**How did you feel when you learned you'd been selected to be on the Community Team?**


I was extremely happy because it made me look forward to getting out of the hospital because I knew I could have one more chance to play *Magic* in a competitive setting, which I haven't been able to do because of DAD and his job at Wizards!


**Have you been to Wizards before? What do you expect to find behind our locked doors?**


Yes, my dad works there.


**What are you doing to prepare for the Community Cup?**


Physical therapy and occupational therapy……oh and some *Magic Online* grinding. :3


**What is your favorite movie and TV show?**


Currently, my favorite movie is *Dark Knight Rises* and my favorite TV show is *Law and Order SVU*.


**Who would you want to play you in a movie about your life?**


If he grew his hair out, Reid Duke, because he's the nicest person in the world next to Good Guy Ben Friedman.


**What is your favorite food?**


Anything with Alfredo sauce.


**If you had a theme song play every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


"I am the Best" by 2NE1.


**Which Planeswalker would you want as a roommate?**


Elspeth.



Sean Plott
**How do you feel you fit into the *Magic* community?**


Given my recent weight gain, I fit snugly.


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


I began playing *Magic* around age 10 (I'm 28 now). I was drawn in by the epicness of the art and the fact that *Magic* seemed like a "hard game." I always loved challenges and *Magic* wound up being a great way to feel powerful and clever, even though I completely misunderstand most of the core rules.


**What drew you to the *Magic* community?**


With so many cards and such a huge range of formats, *Magic* has always had plenty to discuss and debate. For instance, I loved going to [Grand Prix San Jose](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpsj12/welcome), where I could describe my deck to any player and immediately wind up in an involved discussion. That ability to quickly connect to the other players has always been a big draw to me!


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


I love drafting on *Magic Online* because it's a self-contained, two-hour experience. I don't need to do any planning or card hunting. I can quickly pick it up and BOOM, I'm playing!


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


I \_hate\_ blue-based control decks. Let me cast my spells for god's sake.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


I recently asked the Day[9]TV community what they thought, and they largely voted blue—my shows are all about knowledge and learning, after all. You can see why this is a difficult identity crisis for me.


**What impact has the *Magic Online* community had on you?**


About a 5.


**How did you feel when you learned you’d been selected to be on the Community Team?**


I was THRILLED! For me, *Magic* has been a perfect hobby as a "casual tryhard." I enjoy the complexity and trying to get better, but I play mostly to have a blast. I'm delighted to attend an event where that type of fun is the focus!


**What is your favorite movie and TV show?**


Favorite movie—*Sin City*.


Favorite TV show—*Avatar: The Last Airbender*.


**What is your favorite food?**


All of it.


**If you had a theme song play every time you entered a room, what would it be?**

Tom Ross
**How do you feel you fit into the *Magic* community?**


I'm a writer for [StarCityGames](http://www.starcitygames.com/) and a tournament player. I build decks that focus on underplayed cards that tend to be within a budget to attract new players to *Magic*.


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


Right after *Ice Age*, 1997.


**What drew you to the *Magic* community?**


Through writing and tournament finishes I grew in popularity. I think I'm an approachable guy to anyone and willing to give advice to those who ask.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


I'm fond of tennis and pool. I like a wide variety of games and dabble in as many as possible.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


One-on-one Booster Draft. It's a Limited format that you can play with just six booster packs and two people. The match really begins on your first pick and each pick is in response to what your opponent is drafting, so it's a game of outmaneuvering each other. Your decks end up being weaker than in an eight-man draft so each subtle synergy that you can find is important. You get games in with borderline playable cards that you otherwise wouldn't and get to see when they're worthwhile. It also helps your memorization skills, which is important for real-life booster drafting where you can't see the cards you draft mid-pack.


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


The decks I least like playing against are the decks that are extremely vulnerable to sideboard hate cards but otherwise have low interactivity, like Storm or Dredge.


**How did you feel when you learned you'd been selected to be on the Community Team?**


I felt honored. I asked the community and my local game store to nominate me and got a much bigger response than I expected. I see myself as just a guy playing the game I love and often underestimate the impact I have on the people around me.


**Have you been to Wizards before? What do you expect to find behind our locked doors?**


I haven't, but I've always wanted to. I expect to find an environment that's very conducive for letting creative ideas flow, which means letting the employees be as comfortable as possible. I wouldn't be surprised to see people walking around in sweat pants and working at their own paces.


**What are you doing to prepare for the Community Cup?**


I imagine my role will be to help design decks for my teammates when needed. There's no telling what formats will be thrown at us, so a deep knowledge of *Magic* in general will be vital to our success.


**Who would you want to play you in a movie about your life?**


Me.


**What is your favorite food?**


Beef Jerky.


**If you had a theme song play every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


Rick Ross—"Everyday I'm Hustlin'."
