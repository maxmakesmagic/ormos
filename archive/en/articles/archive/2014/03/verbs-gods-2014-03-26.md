It's God Week here at DailyMTG, so let's look at the Gods of—wait... [we've already done that](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1456). Fortunately, the gods of *Theros* interact with the plane directly[1](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1459#1), which is reflected in several *Theros*[2](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1459#2) and *Born of the Gods* cards. So let's look at the art from *those* cards!

1: Yes, "God-Favored" is an adjective, not a verb. "Parts of Speech of the Gods" just isn't as compelling a title.  [(return)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1459#b) 


2: No, this entire Arcana wasn't just to feature the awesome Elspeth art on [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing). Except it totally was. [(return)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1459#b)
