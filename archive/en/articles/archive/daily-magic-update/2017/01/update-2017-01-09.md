The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on January 9, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Promised Ends, Copters full of contraband, and Mages playing with reflections. Happy trails, you three, and best of luck in Modern.


What People Are Talking About

Hard to make anything else the top here, as it's all the community is talking about today, and rightfully so. The article itself [has all of the explanation](http://edit.magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-9-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-01-09) I can give. I expect this won't be the last we discuss this topic this week, but if somehow you haven't seen the article discussing the latest changes to the Banned and Restricted lists, I highly recommend [checking it out](http://edit.magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-9-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-01-09) before reading basically anything *Magic*-related on the internet today.

There was quite a bit of discussion this weekend about the merits of streaming the Super Sunday Series instead of Grand Prix Louisville. There was also a bit of confusion in the community that Helene attempted to clean up. First, as Helene's tweet states, we did not prevent StarCityGames.com from streaming the Grand Prix. Second, we made the choice to stream the Super Sunday Series because there was an opportunity to also stream an *Aether Revolt* Pre-Prerelease on Sunday with the Super Sunday Series competitors. We thought that was an opportunity that was worth it.


You can certainly disagree with that decision—many did—but the decision was made for that reason. Many people enjoyed watching the Sunday Super Series and a pair of Pre-Prerelease events over the weekend (including [LoadingReadyRun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGdg3WrzdQ)'s), and we're glad we could give those viewers a streaming viewing experience this weekend. For those who would have preferred Legacy, we've certainly heard the feedback and will take all of it into consideration in the future.

Many pros spoke up about the date for the B&R list affecting their testing for the next Pro Tour. We are not currently moving up the date for the regular, set-release timed announcement, but we've certainly heard the feedback.


Today's Must
============


1. [*Aether Revolt* Limited Set Review: White](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/aether-revolt-limited-set-review-white/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

The crème de la crème of set reviews, Luis Scott-Vargas has started his march through each of the colors in *Aether Revolt*. As usual, he kicks things off by looking at Limited. Also, as usual, puns are heavily involved.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Top 5 Moments of Grand Prix Louisville](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplou17/top-5-moments-2017-01-08) | Wizards of the Coast | Corbin Hosler

Reid Duke, Reid Duke, Reid Duke. Also, some other things happen, but I don't know of many other players in the community who elicit as much joy from the entire community as Reid Duke winning a Grand Prix. Hosler gamely covers the other highlights of the weekend, but Reid Duke!


1. [*Aether Revolt* Commander Review](http://articles.mtgcardmarket.com/the-command-zone-aether-revolt-commander-review/) | Troy Bishop | MTGCardMarket

There are six new Legendary Creatures in *Aether Revolt*, and Bishop evaluates each for its impact on Commander. Though, if you ask me, the answer to the question of "Which *Aether Revolt* legend will see Commander play" is "yes."


And if you want to take it a step further, Abe Sargent [actually builds with one of the Commanders](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/abesargent-01092017-dont-sweat-the-small-stuff/) (Sram) over on Gathering Magic.


1. [*Aether Revolt* Set Review: White](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/aliaintrazi-01092017-aether-revolt-set-review-white/) | Gathering Magic | Ali Aintrazi

Scott-Vargas isn't the only one leading the set-review train. Gathering Magic's entrant into that space also kicked off today, helmed by Ali Aintrazi. This one is Standard-focused, skipping the Limited rankings, but given today's announcement, Standard is going to be at the forefront of everyone's mind anyway.


1. [*Aether Revolt* Through a Modern Lens](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34340_Aether-Revolt-Through-A-Modern-Lens.html) | Jennifer Long | StarCityGames.com

While much of the talk over this coming week will be about Standard, Long has some ideas about *Aether Revolt*'s impact on Modern, and only one of them rhymes with Natal Shush.


1. [MTGO Academy Announcement: Content Cessation](http://www.mtgoacademy.com/mtgo-academy-announcement-content-cessation/) | MTGO Academy

Their content has slowed as of late, but ceasing is another thing entirely. We get new content creators every day, but sometimes that means others fade away. I expect we'll see many of these writers and content producers again in other forms on other sites. But in the meantime, Godspeed, MTGO Academy.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Jeskai Copycat](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/5mvwaq/standard_jeskai_copy_cat_control/)

This particular list comes [courtesy Reddit user jdmflcl](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/5mvwaq/standard_jeskai_copy_cat_control/), but is a version of a deck that, more or less, set the *Magic* world abuzz over the weekend. Much like the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combos of old, you can once again create an arbitrarily large number of hasty, 1/4s in Standard again by combining [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) and Felidar Guardian.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_4u408sr1Yq.png)


It works like this: Use [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai)'s -2 ability to copy Felidar Guardian. The copy comes in and lets you exile a permanent and then return it (what many call "blink"). You choose to blink [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai), and it comes back into play like it's a brand-new card with 3 loyalty. You can then use the "new" Saheeli's ability again, netting another copy, which blinks Saheeli, and so on.


This list, like many already being worked on, included [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage), a now-banned card, which certainly changes things, though Mage wouldn't have been *necessary* for the deck to function, just very good in it.


Still, don't be surprised to see a deck like this popping up at the Pro Tour in just a few short weeks.


(Note: Cards from *Aether Revolt* are not yet in Gatherer, so they will not show up the same in the deck list below. To view them, visit our [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/aether-revolt).)
