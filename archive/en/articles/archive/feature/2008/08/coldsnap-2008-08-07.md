#### The Gathering Dark


*by Jeff Grubb*
Terisiare lies in ruins. Nations have fallen, goblins raid the land, and an oppressive faith throttles the city-states. Now deep within the walls of the Conclave of Mages, Jodah must decide if unlocking his own immense power is worth taking a step into the dark lands. The epic of the Ice Age begins.


The first book of the Ice Age cycle and one of the most popular Magic novels ever, The Gathering Dark was first published in 1999 and will be included in Coldsnap Fat Packs.

*Terisiare, the island continent that was home to the Brothersâ€™ War and the Ice Age, is in a state of rebirth known as the Thaw. The icy shell that encased the continent is melting away. Most of the inhabitants of Terisiare rejoice as the ice gives way to warmth and the rebirth of the land. But, in this time of great change, there are some who see it as a time to angle for power: a secretive society of mages poised to shroud the continent with their icy brand of magic.*
