You want tokens? We've got tokens!


We've got 24 of them, to be exact. We've got your Angels, your Cats, your Drakes, Bears, Elephants, and Dragons. We've got Knights with first strike and Knights with vigilance. We have two types of Snakes, a few Spirits, and even a Shapeshifter. We have old classics (Saprolings, and Germs, and Zombies, oh my!) and new favorites (Lightning Rager and a certain token enchantment creature) to whet all appetites.


*(Editor's note: It was not clear in the original draft of this article that the tokens are doublel-sided. They are, in fact, double-sided.)*


Take a look at the list below, and collect them all November 13!
