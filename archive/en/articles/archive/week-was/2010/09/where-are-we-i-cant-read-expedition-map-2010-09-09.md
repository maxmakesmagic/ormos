It has been a crazy week. There is a lot of stuff to cover in the wake of [Pro Tour–Amsterdam](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptams10/welcome) and on the cusp of Grand Prix–Portland. Not to mention the fact that we are smack dab in the middle of *Scars of Mirrodin* previews and I just happen to have a card to show you.
