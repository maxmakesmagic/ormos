*In the US this week we're celebrating a day of Thanksgiving. So that the DailyMTG staff can spend more time with their families (and eating), we're bringing you a repeat of last week's column.   
  
 Happy Thanksgiving, Everyone!

Next week is a holiday here in the States called "Thanksgiving," which centers around gathering together with friends and family, often with a meal that features turkey as the main course. So, today, we are going to have a quiz about Birds in **Magic**.

Every time I do one of these quizzes I inevitably get emails and tweets saying how I forget about the Changelings and [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus).

Let this serve as an official disclaimer that I am purposefully and willfully ignoring them for the purposes of this quiz.

Q**1.** Birds appear in every color of **Magic**, with blue having the most. Which color has the fewest? (Note: We are talking mono-color birds.)

*(Difficulty: Easy)*

[50/50 Hint](#) Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.

* [White](#)WRONG White is the second-most prevalent, owing largely to the propensity for Aven creatures to be white.
* [Black](#)WRONG While low, the Vultures of **Magic** buoy this count.
* [Red](#)WRONG Red also struggles in the Bird department; however, the presence of Rocs in **Magic** lift them.
* [Green](#)RIGHT! Despite having [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), one of the most famous Birds in **Magic**, green is largely bereft of Birds, with only five!

  
Q**2.** There is only one card with the Bird subtype on Theros, what is it?

*(Difficulty: Easy)*

  
[Hint](#) | [Reveal](#)

Wrong, keep guessing!

Q**3.** The real world has a number of examples of flightless birds; in **Magic**, however, there are only five such Birds, one of which was printed in *Dragon's Maze*. Can you recall what it is?

*(Difficulty: Medium)*

  
[Hint](#) | [Reveal](#)

Wrong, keep guessing!

Hint: "I want some *moa*"

Q**4.** Which are there more of in **Magic**: Birds with the word "Falcon" in their name or artifact Birds?

*(Difficulty: Medium)*



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Falcons](#) |  | [Artifact Birds](#) |

Right!

Wrong!

There are [nine artifact Birds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advancedamp;type=+%5B%22Artifact%22%5Damp;subtype=+%5B%22Bird%22%5D) in **Magic**, but there are [twelve Birds that have "Falcon" in their name](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advancedamp;name=+%5Bfalcon%5Damp;subtype=+%5B%22Bird%22%5D). Now you know!

Q**5.***Commander* (2013 Edition) gave us [Derevi, Empyrial Tactician](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Derevi%2C+Empyrial+Tactician), who is a legendary Bird Wizard. A fact remarked upon in [the latest "Friday Nights" episode](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/271a). But, Derevi is far from our first legendary Bird. Which of these other legendary Birds was the first to see print?

*(Difficulty: Hard)*

[50/50 Hint](#) Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.

* [Commander Eesha](#)WRONG*Judgment* hit the shelves in 2002.
* [Kangee, Aerie Keeper](#)RIGHT! Kangee was printed in *Invasion*, which released in October of 2000.
* [Lieutenant Kirtar](#)WRONG The Lieutenant was released in *Odyssey*, which hit the shelves in October of 2001.
* [Major Teroh](#)WRONG Major Teroh was in *Torment*, which released in February of 2002.
