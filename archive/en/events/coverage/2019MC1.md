Sunday Coverage



In the first Mythic Championship of 2019, Autumn Burchett and their Curious Obsession with mismatched—but no less effective—Islands cut through the competition and Top 8 to claim victory over 498 other players.


With a Round 16 draw into their first Mythic Champonship Top 8, Burchett was one of three Mono-Blue Tempo decks poised for an opportunity at winning a Mythic Championship and the biggest piece of $500,000 in prizes.


The Sunday showdown featured a stacked field: Luis Scott-Vargas notched his *tenth* Mythic Championship Top 8, Marcio Carvalho added his sixth, and Reid Duke achieved his fourth. The path to the finals was packed with powerful players. Burchett deftly dealt with Julien Berteaux, expertly dueled with Duke, and emerged from both to face-off against Yoshihiko Ikawa—the two-time Mythic Championship Top 8 contender that knocked Scott-Vargas out of the other side of the bracket—in the finals. With a close match carried out to five full games, it was Burchett's arsenal of counterspells—and a flurry of Wizard's Retorts—that secured their victory.


The weekend showcased Standard's full range of decks, and it's clear the future for *Magic* is bright. But from the spotlights and cameras at the first Mythic Championship of 2019, the brightest light of all came from Autumn Burchett and their victory as champion of the 2019 Mythic Championship I. Congratulations!
