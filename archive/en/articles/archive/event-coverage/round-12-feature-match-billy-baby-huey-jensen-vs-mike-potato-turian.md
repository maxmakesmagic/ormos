Mike Turian started US Nationals 7-0, but since then has encountered difficulty, going 1-3 in his last four matches. With his tiebreakers still strong, his chances for making top 8 with a win stay excellent, but standing in his way is one very large obstacle: 'Baby Huey" Billy Jensen.


At 6'8", Billy looms large amongst his peers, but its on the table where he needs to be feared: the PT London Top 8 finisher is one of the country's finest, and of these two American titans, only one can advance to the top 8.


### Game 1


Baby Huey started this game out in aggressive fashion, playing Llanowar Elf before Mike played a 1/1 of his own, Ramosian Sergeant. On Huey's turn, he decided not to attack, informing Mike that he felt the Elf was the more important creature, so Mike knew he could attack for one, but after playing a Port and using it, Mike was unable to play a third land, with Huey's Thornscape Battlemage taking out the Sergeant before it could be activated.


After Mike again failed to play a land (casting a Defiant Falcon), Huey returned the Battlemage to his hand with Shivan Wurm and with Mike again failing to play his third land, Mike had to concede in the face of an insurmountable disadvantage.


Jensen 1, Turian 0 


### Game 2


After Mike's unfortunate game one, things didn't start much better in game two. Mike looked at his opening hand and knew immediately that he had no choice but to take a mulligan, and by Billy's resulting celebration, it was obvious the big man was happy with his hand. Things continued to improve for Billy as Mike elected to go to five cards, with Jenson happily saying "better lucky than good," with the unfortunate Turian only being able to comment 'haven't had much luck today'.


Finally, Mike found a five card hand he was content with and the game started with Mike stopping at one land while Huey cast a Bird of Paradise on turn 1, a Fires of Yavamaya on turn two, and after using the port to tap the one Plains on turn three, Huey cast a turn four Saproling Burst, with Mike extending his hand at the realization that he needed to draw both a Disenchant and a land in one draw step. An unfortunate end after a great start.


**Final Result:** Jensen 2, Turian 0
