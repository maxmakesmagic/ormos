Welcome to *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*: *Magic Online* Edition! Get ready to download files from the mainframe, bring to life the history of the past, and join us on our return to a plane 1,200 years in the making!


Something About Us
==================


With a return to Kamigawa come the usual events: Constructed Leagues reset, Limited Leagues end, avatars for the previous set are distributed, and Treasure Chests updated. You'll be able to join our shiny *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* events beginning at 10 a.m. PT on Thursday, February 10.


*Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* brings a new mechanic called reconfigure, and some returning mechanics such as ninjutsu and channel. Nothing too complex for a keyboard cowboy such as yourself! And of course, with any release we also fix issues and implement a whole host of other behind-the-scenes improvements.


In fact, for this release, we have completely replaced the collation of the *Magic Online* Player Rewards packs! They are now filled to the brim with basic lands, some being distributed here for the very first time! Each MOPR Pack contains one of these basic lands, and they are all completely tradeable!

[Full information for the MOPR Program can be found here.](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-player-rewards)


Sandstorm
=========


Redemption returns for *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* so that you can synthesize your digital code into cardboard in the mortal realm! Similar to previous sets, the full art ukiyo-e basic lands will also be required for redemption. The dates this time around are:


* **Redemption Begins**: March 9, 2022
* **Redemption Reprint Guarantee Date**: June 22, 2022
* **Redemption Cutoff Date**: July 27, 2022

Pursuit of Happiness
====================


As mentioned before, Treasure Chests have been rebalanced, and not only has the drop rate of many cards been increased (such as [Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ragavan%2C+Nimble+Pilferer)), we've also brought a lot more cards from Commander sets to *Magic Online*. Not just from *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Commander, but also Commander sets from the past, all the way back to include a member of the *Weatherlight* crew from *Commander (2019 Edition)*!


Every single member of the *Magic Online* team continues to give their all to bring you as many Commander cards and features as possible, so thank you for your patience. Enjoy!

[Do You Wanna Draft My] Avatar
==============================


Now, let's check out the avatars you'll be able to find in *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*:


As usual, we include an avatar in our New Account Starter Kit and Deck Builder's Essentials: *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*, which you can find in the store. For this set, we have a drafter's best friend: the Spirited Companion doggo!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/Doggo%20Avatar.png)


Next, here are the Prestige avatars up for grabs! As a reminder, you get five points for each Competitive Trophy you earn in leagues and one for each Friendly Trophy. At the end of the *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* season, you'll earn every avatar you qualify for:


* Earning at least 5 points gets you the uncommon Kaito Shizuki Prestige avatar. Believe it!
* Earning at least 20 points nabs you the rare Tamiyo, Compleated Sage Prestige avatar. All Will Be One, or something.
* Earning 40 points or more rewards you with the mythic The Wandering Emperor Prestige avatar. Hats off to all those who wander enough to earn this one!

And finally, here are the other residents of Kamigawa that can be found as avatars in Treasure Chests. From the kawaii to the kowaii, they can all be found in Treasure Chests and are always tradeable.


The Treasure Chest avatars for *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* are:


* March of Otherworldly Light Yokai
* Lucky Offering Neko
* Skyswimmer Koi
* Dockside Chef
* Nashi, Moon Sage's Scion
* Raiyuu, Storm's Edge

* Towashi Songshaper

For two weeks, you'll get to experience Super Jump**,** where you'll get to pick two packets from among those with such names as: "[Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf)," "[Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow)," and "[Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll)"!
