Our next round of Alchemy and Historic balance changes is scheduled to arrive in *MTG Arena* on Thursday, October 6! These include changes to Historic-only rebalanced cards, as well as additional changes to *Streets of New Capenna* Limited play.


Below is the full list of card changes you can look forward to playing with on *MTG Arena* once the October 6 update is live!


Historic Card Rebalancing
=========================


As part of the *Alchemy: Dominaria* game update, the original tabletop versions of these cards will be returned to Historic. More information can be found in [this month's State of the Game](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-alchemy-dominaria).

Standard Card Rebalancing
=========================


After reviewing the *Streets of New Capenna* Limited data collected over the past few months, we found three issues with the format that we want to address and solve:


**Encourage Three-Color Decks**


We feel that there is not enough incentive to draft the three-color families over the more streamlined ally two-color decks. We are addressing this by reducing the cost of the three-color common "mana-fixing" creatures like Ominous Parcel, while increasing the rate of some of the three-color payoffs like Mr. Orfeo, the Boulder; Queza, Auguar of Agonies; and Cabaretti Charm.


**Slow Down the Pace of Games**


We want to make removal and blocking more successful against shield counters, blitz, and aggressive decks. Incriminate being more cost effective, Psionic Snoop and Midnight Assassin being better blockers, and Deal Gone Bad gaining life should help players catch up when behind and interact more successfully with creatures with shield counters.


**Make More Cards Viable Draft Picks**


We want to increase the strength of some of the cards that haven't been seeing play. We believe that this will make drafting and deck building more interesting while increasing the likelihood that you're able to draft enough playable cards while also prioritizing fixing.


**Speakeasy Server**  

Changed "you gain 1 life for each other creature you control" to "you gain 1 life for each creature you control."
