**Name:** Peter van der Ham


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Storage tank integrity engineer


**Hometown:** Dordrecht, the Netherlands


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Dutch Legacy champion 2011, 5-0 with Rebels on *Magic Online*.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Grixis Delver—couldn't find a good deck to beat it.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman)—it makes mana, it gains life, it wins the game.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Badlands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Badlands), because you can't cast all the BB spells without it, at least not consistently.

**Name:** Bernardo Santos

**Hometown:** Lison, Portugal


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Liverpool Top 4, qualified for MOCS twice.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Grixis Delver. I like how it plays well against everything and I think it's very good.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman). The card is a Legacy staple for a reason; so good all around.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). It overperformed and I sideboarded it a lot.

Making four consecutive Top 8s in Belgian Legacy Cup Trials with Esper Stoneblade, and some other Top 8s in local events.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Steel Stompy. I chose this deck because it's tons of fun and it has a good matchup against a lot of the field.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), because people forgot how to play against it.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Karn, Scion of Urza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Scion+of+Urza). I only played the card a few times, but when I did it always won.

**Age:** 31


**Occupation:** Brand strategist


**Hometown:** Frederiksberg, Denmark


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Two-time FNM winner.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Grixis Kess Control. I love Kess and I feel favored against Four-Color and Miracles. Also, Leovold is a miserable card.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Kess, Dissident Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kess%2C+Dissident+Mage). The card gives you and edge in the "mirror" against Czech Pile and can pull you back from horrible positions.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope). She is incredible in all fair matchups.

Beta duals. I complete!


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Flusterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flusterstorm). Good against combo and Delver.

**Occupation:** Wannabe *Magic* pro


**Hometown:** Wrocław, Poland


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Lyon champion.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Grixis Delver. I don't play enough Legacy to understand the whole format, so I just picked what's considered the best deck and played it online as much as I could.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


The [Forked Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt) which already won Grand Prix Lyon for me.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy)—never knew what I should name though.

Dredge, because it was the only affordable Legacy deck for me. I borrowed the [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond).


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)! It returns from the grave.

[Silent Gravestone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Gravestone). Shuts down most graveyard hate.

First *Magic* player in Scotland. Played Pro Tour 22 years ago, ten in total.

[Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void)—win on turn one.
