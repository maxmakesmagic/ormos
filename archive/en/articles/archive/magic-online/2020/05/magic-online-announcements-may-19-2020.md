*Magic Online* Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------


As part of our initiatives to give you [more ways to play at home](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/FNM_at_Home), we wanted to provide options for you to play at the highest levels for competitive stakes. Therefore, in light of the [changes to the tabletop Players Tour Qualifiers announced earlier](https://magic.gg/news/changes-to-qualifiers-for-players-tour-series-2-events-and-schedule), we're adding a new series of qualifiers to [*Magic Online*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/what-magic-online-magic-online-products-game-info) to provide additional ways for players to compete and qualify for upcoming Players Tour events: *Magic Online* Super Qualifiers. These online events will run alongside existing *Magic Online* Qualifiers and will continue to invite players to Players Tour Series 2 events.

Cube Spotlight: *Cultic Cube* May 20–27
---------------------------------------


The Cube Spotlight Series returns with two weeks of Cube Spotlights featuring offerings from CubeCon. Next up, from May 20–27, we're running *Cultic Cube* by John Terrill ([CulticCube](https://www.youtube.com/culticcube/)on YouTube), creator of the [Château Cube](https://anchor.fm/culticcube) podcast. *Cultic Cube* is packed with exciting, thoughtful picks for engaging and dynamic gameplay, and you can read more about all the cube's deck archetypes and view the full card list [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/cube-spotlight-series-john-terrills-cultic-cube-2020-05-18).

*Ikoria* Season's Cube Spotlights Announced!
--------------------------------------------


Now that we're closer to the events, it's time to share what's going on with the upcoming Cube Spotlight-shaped holes in our Alternative Play calendar.


In partnership with the now-postponed [CubeCon](https://mtgcubecon.com/), we're going to be running two of their cubes in consecutive weeks coming up. Gwen Dekker's *Dekkaru Cube* is going to run from May 13 to May 20, and [you can read all about that cube here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/cube-spotlight-series-gwen-dekkers-dekkaru-cube-2020-05-08), including a full cube list and a discussion of its major and minor archetypes. Immediately following that is John Terrill's *Cultic Cube*, running from May 20 to May 27. You can see [John's article and cube list from Monday, May 18](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/cube-spotlight-series-john-terrills-cultic-cube-2020-05-18), and it's a must-read since it goes deep into the philosophy of cube design theory in general and the creation of *Cultic Cube* in particular.


Then we've got a week for the *War of the Spark* Encore drafts. (Remember, Encore drafts aren't phantom; you'll keep everything you draft!) They're sweet, but not news.


What is news is that, starting June 3, [streamer and content creator Amaz](https://www.twitch.tv/amaz) will present his *Peasant Cube*! His article will be going up a few days before the event begins, and you can check it out then. In the meantime, you can watch Amaz stream *Magic Online* and other games on Twitch at [twitch.tv/amaz](https://www.twitch.tv/amaz).
