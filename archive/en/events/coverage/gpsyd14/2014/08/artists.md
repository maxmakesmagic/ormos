 We were lucky enough to catch up with the two *Magic* artists at GP Sydney, R.K. Post and Stephen Belledin. Post has painted iconic images like [Avatar of Woe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Woe), [Morphling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling) and [Lightning Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel), while Stephen's arresting artwork include [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and the wince-inducing *M12* [Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark). Our chat found it's way onto the topic of the depiction of women in fantasy art.




 "Really, it's up to the artist's interpretation," said Post. "We have to walk a fine line between what the Art Director wants to see, what do you want to see as the artist, and what the audience wants. 'Sexy' sells, but the art direction in *Magic* is not to be disrespectful to women. The pressure away from that is definitely coming from Art Direction. I do like to make armour that would work, not chainmail bikinis."
