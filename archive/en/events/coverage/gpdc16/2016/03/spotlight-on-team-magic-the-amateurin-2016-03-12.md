 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






I try to be objective at Magic tournaments but whenever someone in the coverage family is playing I can’t help but root for them to do well.



Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff (of Magic: the Amateuring) along with Athena Huey have all worked at Grand Prix in recent months. For this team Grand Prix they joined forces and let their actions do the talking. When we caught up with them early on Day One they were 2-0-1 and spoke with me about creating content, competing in Grand Prix events, and what makes playing alongside your friends such a special experience.
