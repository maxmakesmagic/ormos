![Feature Match: Oiso vs. Walls](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/841.jpg)Both players need a win here, and a win next round to make Top 8. If Walls pulls it off, it will be his third Top 8 in a major individual event in a row- he did it at U.S. Nationals, then at Worlds.

### Game 1

Oiso played [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) on turn two, and Walls played [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) activated to show a hand filled with artifacts, one of which was a [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), which brought the mana count up to twenty.

Walls- "This format is *so* good!"

![Ooiso Ports](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/843.jpg)With all that mana to work with, Oiso played a Dynamo and a Monolith, then summoned a [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) to kill itself off along with the [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), ensuring that the Oath would not trigger. Walls played a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), but missed his third land drop. On the following turn he played [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) imprinted with [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), but Oiso's two [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port)s kept it from being a problem. Eventually Walls found a third land, and played a second Scepter set to [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice). Soon he had it running as an [Icy Manipulator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator), drawing a card with each activation. The game slowed down drastically, as Oiso couldn't do much with Walls' two Scepters active. At this point, the Scepter started to shoot Oiso for two damage a turn. Eventually, he activated his [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), as Walls turned to Mark Rosewater and stared him down.

Walls- "This card is so stupid. Why?!"

Rosewater- "Because it's fun!"

[Krosan Reclamation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) shuffled back in the [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), and Oiso set a third Scepter to [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). With Walls all tapped out, Oiso cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), and replayed more than enough artifact mana along with a [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). With the help of [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), Walls was able to bring the Oath right back out. The [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) attacked for damage, and then shot itself down so that the Oath wouldn't trigger. Walls played a Scepter with [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice), and shot Oiso down to four life. Two turns later, the game was over.

Walls- "God, **Magic** is dumb. That was the most one-sided game I've ever seen, and I still won."

Oiso 0 - Walls 1

### Game 2

![Gabe Walls prepares to hitchhike home](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/842.jpg)Walls played [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), and Oiso had [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) came out a turn later, along with [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). This led to [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) and a Dynamo, but Oiso had no threat to take advantage of Walls being tapped out. Walls used [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to search out [Shattering Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse), and on the next turn Oiso used [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) to get [Planar Portal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Portal). He had enough mana left to activate it, and searched up [Welding Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar), which came right into play. Walls took his turn, and played Isochron's Scepter, putting [Shattering Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse) under it. Oiso used the Portal to get [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), which found [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). Once it was activated, Walls conceded.

Oiso 1 - Walls 1

### Game 3

Walls started off by going through his deck with [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and a sac-land, while Oiso played [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) came out on the following turn, and Walls used [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to get [Shattering Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse) on end step. He then untapped and played [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter), which Oiso responded to with [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle). Walls added [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) to the stack, so the Scepter came into play and was set to [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) something every turn. Oiso had an answer, and played [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). The Scepter destroyed itself, and [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) came into play with [Cognivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore) under it. Oiso summoned a [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) on his next turn, and started to attack with it. A second [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) was played a few turns later, and Walls cast [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to get [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). He cast it on upkeep after a [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) activation, and the piles presented were [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids)/[Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)-[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) and [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), Isochron's Scepter and [Yavimaya Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast)- Walls took the two card pile, and played [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). Oiso now took his turn and activated a [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), then cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). On Walls' turn, Oiso forced him to discard down to nothing but lands and a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). A [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) for thirteen was the nail in the coffin, leading to [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for [Planar Portal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Portal). This put him in complete control of the game, and Walls conceded rather than sit through more agony.
