* ### Round 9 Bubble-Match Round-Up


*by Olle Rade*
  
  

The last round of the first day is always the first big crowd pleaser at a Grand Prix. Big names fighting to make day two, big names making day two and big names failing to make day two. It's hard to follow all the action, but we caught a glimpse of some of the matches where a ticket for tomorrow was on stake.


### Michael Bonde (Stoneblade) vs. Gaël Bailly-Maitre (Elves)

*Michael Bonde* 
 

Danish all around good guy Michael Bonde was fighting for his tournament life in the last round. And he was in for a rough one. After splitting the first two games against his French Elves opponent his turn two Stoneforge (fetching [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte)) was matched with a [Natural Order](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) fetching [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus). Bonde drew for his turn, passed, took 10 from the gigantic monster and crossed his fingers in his next draw step. A big smile on his face gave it away though, he had the answer in a [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), wiping the entire board, leaving his opponent with no creatures and only two lands in hand. The rest was a formality, and Michael Bonde and his 1-of [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) makes day two.


### Michael Bonde wins 2–1


 

### Melissa DeTora (UWR Stoneblade/Delver) vs. Guglielmo Baldelli (Omnitell)

*Guglielmo Baldelli vs. Melissa DeTora* 
 

Melissa DeTora was looking in good shape to make day two after her fast [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) backed up by countermagic took the first game from Italian Guglielmo Baldelli. His sideboard plans begged to differ though. Both post board games saw him cast an early [Defense Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defense+Grid) allowing him to resolve Show and tell. In game two he went for the flashy win with [Omniscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) into [Enter the Infinite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enter+the+Infinite) (eventually winning by fetching [Release the Ants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Release+the+Ants) with [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), putting [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) on the top of his deck and recurring [Release the Ants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Release+the+Ants). Game three he simply put an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) into play, and that was enough to win the match,


### Guglielmo Baldelli wins 2-1

*Thomas Enevoldsen vs. Nuno Miranda* 
 

The grandfather of Death and Taxes, and winner of last years European Legacy Grand Prix Thomas Enevoldsen was also fighting for survival on the last round of the day. Unfortunately his opponents [Delver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) deck had some pretty strong draws. In game one he counter Enevoldsen's [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) with [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), cast [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze)d Enevoldsen's [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) and attacked 5 times while Enevoldsen was stuck on just one land. Game two was equally swift as [Mother of Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) and [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) couldn't match up against [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) into [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) from the Portugese.


### Nuno Miranda wins 2-0


 

### Jamie Parke (Stoneblade) vs. Marijn Lybaert (UWR Stoneblade/Delver)

*Jamie Parke vs. Marijn Lybaert* 
 

In the battle of [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)s it was Belgian Marijn Lybaert who turned out to have the upper edge, as his [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) proved too hard to deal with for American Jamie Parke. When both players have [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) in play it seemed very hard to lose the race when equipping it to a [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) and being able to both block and nullify your opponents life gain.


### Marijn Lybaert wins 2-0
