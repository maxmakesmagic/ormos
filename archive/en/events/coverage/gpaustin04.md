Grand Prix Austin 2004
----------------------


TOGIT Gets LEGIT in Austin!
===========================




October 8-10











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpaus04/win.jpg)Put it in the books! Jon Sonne has won his first major event, hoisting the Grand Prix trophy this weekend in Austin, Texas. Sonne was one of the few TOGIT mainstays without some hardware to display on his mantle.


White was hotly contested all day long at the Rochester draft tables with abundant tales of woe involving four or five players in a row fighting for the color. While there were two other white drafters at the table, Jon was able to corner the market on Cage of Hands and had four copies of the enchantment in his Top 8 deck. Combined with his two Frostwielders, Jon was ready for almost anything and lost only one game in the elimination rounds along his way to winning the $2,400 first prize.


Congratulations to Jon Sonne and everyone who made the Top 8 this weekend!

Sunday, October 10: 9:24 pm - Finals: Eugene Levin vs. Jon Sonne
----------------------------------------------------------------


Eugene Levin had no expectations of getting out of the quarterfinals against Neil Reeves. But he dispatched the Texas superstar in a tight three game match. His black-white deck made maximum use out of Blessed Breath, including one of the finest plays anyone could recall in recent memory against Gerry Thompson in the semifinals. The twenty-year old Los Angeles based student was up against a much more experienced player in the finals with the deck many considered to be the best of the draft.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpaus04/f1.jpg)Jon Sonne is just the latest in along line of TOGIT players to reach the Top 8 of a Grand Prix--not that he is any stranger to high level success. He has high finishes at multiple team Pro Tours and this was his second GP Top 8 for his resume. Sonne is perhaps best known for his glacial pace of play and his deliberate decision making process. While still not the fastest player in the room, Jon's pace has quickened considerably. His deck for the finals featured hasty Ronin Houndmasters, four Cage of Hands, and Kiki-Jiki Mirror Breaker.


The room was pretty much cleared out by the time the finals began to play out. Only a few of the TOGIT faithful remained in the room to alternately cheer Jon on and get in some well-timed barbs.


### Game 1


Eugene was on the play and he would be starting with six cards. 8bc/kljcbcX--Sorry that was because Craig Krempels was squeezing my arm and because Jon's opponent shipped back his opening hand.. Jon made the first play of the game with Kami of Ancient Law. Levin's Kitsune Blademaster was removed from the game with Yamabushi's Flame and Jon beat for two. He had Cage of Hands for a Nezumi Ronin and added a Devoted Retainer to his board.


Eugene's Cruel Deceiver threatened to hold Jon at bay but Sonne was uncharacteristically aggressive--he played Ronin Houndmaster and swung with the team. Levin offered his Cruel Deceiver up to the Kami of Ancient Law and Jon accepted the trade. Levin removed the Ronin from the game with Reciprocate.


Frostwielder looked like a big card for Jon who returned his Cage of Hands and shot the Ronin. Levin had the black dragon which was promptly imprisoned and Jon continued to smash with his 1/1 samurai. Levin played a Cruel Deceiver and passed the turn. When Sonne shot the spirit, Levin cast Otherworldly Journey and spliced Blessed Breath onto it. Jon returned Cage of Hands but Levin still had Blessed Breath in hand.


Jon made him use the Breath but had no other play. Levin's Cruel Deceiver returned at the end of Jon's turn. He attacked with a Dragon and Jon fell to 15. Jon's deck yielded another Cage and a Hearth Kami and Levin rolled his eyes.


Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker gave Jon two pingers a turn but Levin put an end to that on his next turn with a Pull Under. Didn't matter, Jon drew another actual Frostwielder and the two reached for their sideboards.


Jon - 1 Eugene - 0


### Game 2


While the players shuffled Osyp entertained the intimate gathering of spectators with a story about Sonne yelling at people in the crowded TOGIT room last night. Patrick Sullivan was not happy, "Jon is getting a little bit of a sass-mouth on him -- I don't know when that happened. He's starting to get a spine, -- it makes him less fun to hang out with, but I still love him."


Jon opened with a Zubera and Ronin Houndmaster. Eugene had Reciprocate again but Jon wanted to read the card. Osyp exploded as Jon examined the new Swords, "It's the same card as last game Jon!"


Eugene chuckled, "In the Swiss he played Samurai of the Pale Curtain and then in the next game I played one…and he had to read it." Eugene's Cruel Deceiver stepped in the path of the Zubera but Jon had Indomitable Will. Eugene summoned the Scuttling Death--he was holding Dragon but was not able to achieve six mana.


Jon had another Ronin Houndmaster and attacked with both his guys. Scuttles blocked Zubera and Jon did one to Eugene who soulshifted back a Deceiver.


Jon played out two Frostwielders over the next two turns but Levin had the Rend Flesh for one of them before things could get out of hand. His Kabuto Moth was encaged with hands and Levin countered it with Blessed Breath. Jon dropped him to 9 with the Houndmaster.


Levin found the mana to play his dragon but Jon was ready with Cage of Hands. A couple of turns later Jon played Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker and passed the turn. He tried to use the waylay trick to make a Frostwielder that would last through to the next turn but Levin stopped him, "Hold on hold on. What if the target is not there?"


"It is countered on resolution."


"Great." Levin cast Pull Under on the pinger and spliced Blessed Breath, targeting his Dragon. Jon responded by returning his Cage of hands.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpaus04/f2.jpg)Jon attempted to recage the Dragon on his turn, knowing full well that Blessed Breath would counter it and leave Levin tapped out. Jon then showed him a Yamabushi's Flame and the TOGIT gang erupted--


--but not in cheers. "Boooooo!!!" shouted Osyp and Sullivan in chorus.


"Boooooo….what a baggy slow-roll."


Jon looked genuinely surprised, "Why not tap him out?"


Again, in chorus, "He had no cards in hand!!!!! Booooooo!"


Final result: Jon Sonne - 2 Eugene Levin - 0


"I felt like I was going to win this last night," said the happy--I assume he was happy--Sonne.
