### Amir Radmard


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** IT Tech


**Hometown:** Oklahoma City


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** I beat someone with [Colossus of Akros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossus+of+Akros).


**What deck did you play and why?**  

Bant with Red, it's highly favored in Bant mirrors and the red splash creatures outclass other creatures.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  

• [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), counters clutch spells  

• [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke), keeps them from making bigger plays


**After this weekend would you play this deck again? What would you change?**  

Yes. I'd try to find another red source for the deck to build a better mana base.

### Cody Lingelbach


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Poker Dealer


**Hometown:** Portland, Oregon


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


* 4th Place GP Oakland 2016
* 2nd Place TCG Player Max Point 50K
* Multiple Invitational Top 16s

**What deck did you play and why?**  

Grixis Dragons. I felt that the Mardu thopter deck I played in Oakland was still good but the blue cards in this deck were just better positioned than [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) right now.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  
[Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), not close.


**After this weekend would you play this deck again? What would you change?**  

I would not play the [Seismic Rupture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Rupture) in the sideboard. I'm not 100% sure what I would add, maybe a [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar).

**Hometown:** Dallas, Texas

PTQ Top 8


**What deck did you play and why?**  

Mardu Green. I played it because the deck has a strong mid and late game and has good synergy.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  

The second Chandra in the sideboard was an all-star all day.


**After this weekend would you play this deck again? What would you change?**  

Yes, I would continue honing the sideboard and probably not play mainboard [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command).

**After this weekend would you play this deck again? What would you change?**  

Yep. I'd maybe add another [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) or maybe a [Minister of Pain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minister+of+Pain).

I would fix the lands in my deck so it is easier to cast my spells.

**What deck did you play and why?**  
[Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales), because Pascal Maynard is an angel and told me it was good!


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  
[High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin), it's my pet card and I'm often teased for playing it. But it's a huge flying [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) in this deck!


**After this weekend would you play this deck again? What would you change?**  

Maybe! Cutting a couple of lands for [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) to prevent flooding and to soak up [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command)s to protect [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales).

### Mark Jacobson


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Hardware Engineer at Nvidia


**Hometown:** Philadelphia, PA


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


* 12th at PT Origins
* Top 4 GP Toronto

**What deck did you play and why?**  
[Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) - it has many powerful draws. Even its average draws typically have a lot of synergy. White provides good sideboard cards.


**What sideboard card was the most important against the field? Why?**  
[Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance). It gives no-frills coverage against large creatures and doubles as a means of protecting your own important creatures.


**After this weekend would you play this deck again? What would you change?**  

Maybe, maybe not. It's lost all of its surprise value. The main deck is pretty much perfect, but there are lots of potential tweaks to the board.
