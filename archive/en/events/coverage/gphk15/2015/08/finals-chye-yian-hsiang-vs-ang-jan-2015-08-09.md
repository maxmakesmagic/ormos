All that separates Chye Yian Hsiang and Ang Jan from the biggest prize is a single match. Both players have very solid decks, capable of blistering fast starts.


Without further ado, let's proceed to the most exciting match of the weekend!

Game 1
======


Chye's [Consul's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consul%27s+Lieutenant) was quickly stymied by Ang's [Runed Servitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Servitor) and [Valeron Wardens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valeron+Wardens). Chye decided to attack anyway, representing a trick.


Ang chose to block with [Valeron Wardens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valeron+Wardens), baiting out [Enshrouding Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enshrouding+Mist). That enabled him to successfully resolve [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts), clearing Chye's board completely.


Chye's [Prickleboar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prickleboar) met with [Lightning Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Javelin) and it looked like Ang was ahead. Enchanting [Runed Servitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Servitor) with [Call of the Full Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Full+Moon), that didn't last very long because Chye suppressed it with [Suppression Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suppression+Bonds).


Eventually, it was [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade), enchanted with [Grasp of the Hieromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+the+Hieromancer) and backed up with a second [Enshrouding Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enshrouding+Mist), that went all the way.

**Chye Yian Hsian 1 - Ang Jan 0**


Game 2
======


Chye once again opened with [Consul's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consul%27s+Lieutenant), which was able to sneak past Ang's [Boggart Brute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Brute). When Ang counterattacked, the poor Goblin was blasted away with [Celestial Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Flare).


[Consul's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consul%27s+Lieutenant) charged into the red zone, this time inflicting four damage, thanks to it being renowned and enchanted by [Grasp of the Hieromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+the+Hieromancer). [Lightning Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Javelin) by Ang took care of that.

[Suppression Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suppression+Bonds) kept [Acolyte of the Inferno](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acolyte+of+the+Inferno) in check, but Chye had no solution to [Embermaw Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermaw+Hellion) other than to race with [Prickleboar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prickleboar). With both players hovering at 5 life, any thing could tip the scales.


Enter [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pia+and+Kiran+Nalaar).

When Ang attacked with [Embermaw Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermaw+Hellion), Chye went down to 1 life. Did Ang have any burn or combat tricks?


No!


All Chye had to do was untap, swing with his team and fling a pair of Thopters at his opponent for the win!


**Chye Yian Hsiang 2 - Ang Jan 0**


Congratulations Chye Yian Hsiang, our Grand Prix Hong Kong 2015 Champion!
