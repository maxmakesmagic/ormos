This week we're celebrating teams at DailyMTG, and what better way to do so than by taking a look back at the different teams in *Magic*'s history! Throughout *Magic*'s deep lore, there have been many teams of heroes that have banded together. Below are just a few of our favorites!


The *Weatherlight* Crew
=======================

The crew of the *Weatherlight* ran the ship—and the plot for *Magic* sets, starting with *Weatherlight* and extending into *Apocalypse.* The story is deep and the drama between the crew complex, filled with surprise betrayals and hidden relationships. Notable crew members include [Gerrard Capashen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard+Capashen), [Captain Sisay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain+Sisay), [Hanna, Ship's Navigator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanna%2C+Ship%27s+Navigator), [Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero), [Karn, Silver Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem), and [Squee, Goblin Nabob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob).


Kamahl and Chainer
==================

Kamahl and Chainer were friends in the Cabal pit fights on the plane of Dominaria, forming a successful partnership that resulted in them breaking the record for the most consecutive wins. However, through a series of events, Chainer became corrupted and warped by the power of the [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). Despite his best efforts, Kamahl was unable to stop or save his friend. When Chainer died, he gave the [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) to Kamahl, who took it and attached it to the pommel of his sword, intending to keep the powerful artifact out of dangerous hands.


Elspeth and Ajani
=================

Elspeth and Ajani had a long friendship that began with their meeting on the fractured plane of Alara. From there, Elspeth found herself embroiled in the events on Mirrodin as the Phyrexians took over the plane. After barely surviving the fall of Mirrodin and the rise of New Phyrexia, Elspeth and Ajani again met on Theros. There, Elspeth and Ajani became entangled in the intrigue of the gods, ending with the death of Elspeth and her entering the Underworld. Ajani, broken-hearted at the loss of another friend, took on Elspeth's mantle—much as he had taken his brother's axe.


Kytheon and His Irregulars
==========================

Gideon Jura did not always go by that name. He was born Kytheon Iora on the plane of Theros, and had a team of friends and compatriots known as his Irregulars. His friends stood up to tyranny and fought for the poor and the weak. However, Kytheon's hubris pushed him to lead his Irregulars into a foolish attack against [Erebos, God of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead). In the aftermath, Kytheon stood as the only survivor—having directly caused the death of all his friends. The trauma of the ordeal ignited his spark, and he planeswalked to Alara, where he took on the mantle of Gideon Jura. There, he began his long road toward redemption.


Nahiri, Sorin, and Ugin
=======================

These three powerful mages were the original Planeswalkers responsible for trapping the Eldrazi on the plane of Zendikar. Nahiri, who was from Zendikar, stood watch over the Eldrazi for millennia. More recently, events have led to Sorin's revival of Ugin and Ugin's return to Zendikar. However, Nahiri is currently missing, and it is unclear whether the trio can assemble once again to recapture the Eldrazi that are now loose upon the world.
