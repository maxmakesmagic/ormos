### June, 1995: The *Ice Age* Comes to **Magic**

[![Ice Age](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_iceage_expansionLogo_en.jpg)](/en/articles/archive/ice-age-2008-08-11)Released in June 1995, *Ice Age* was the most anticipated set of that year. The first true stand-alone expansion for **Magic: The Gathering**, it was compatible with the basic game, but also contained enough basic land and basic spells to be playable without additional cards.

*Ice Age* brought with it the first serious exploration of "allied colors". While multicolored cards had been around since *Legends*, *Ice Age* explicitly built up the alliances between neighboring colors with cards like [Tinder Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinder+Wall), [Norritt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norritt), and [Orcish Lumberjack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Lumberjack).

*Ice Age* would be followed by *Homelands* and then the first set designed as a sequel, *Alliances*. Many years later, *Coldsnap* would provide the third set for the *Ice Age* block (which up until then had included *Homelands* by default).
