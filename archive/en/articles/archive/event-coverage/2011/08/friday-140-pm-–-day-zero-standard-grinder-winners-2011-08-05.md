So I know you guys all want this stuff. You know, the winning Standard decklists that got unqualified players qualified for Nationals? Well guess what, I got 'em right here. No big surprises, but Mono Red lists always make me smile. Watch out for a few interesting cards though. There's an [Abyssal Persecutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Persecutor) hidden amongst these cards, and a few [Gravitational Shift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift) s to boot. Additionally, [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) rears its head to remind us of the other Blue-Red combo deck running around.


These guys showed up ready to enjoy the GenCon weekend, and ended up playing in the big show. Pretty sweet, folks.
