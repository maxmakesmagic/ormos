Grand Prix Paris 2008
---------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppar08/Arjan-van-Leeuwen-winner-pic.jpg)


He has beaten 1,838 players. He has lost only two matches over 18 rounds. He has survived the biggest and toughest Magic tournament in history, and emerged on the far side covered only in glory, and the list of the players he has left trailing in his dust is as tall as a four-storey building, when laid end-to-end. He is Arjan Van Leeuwen, and he is the champion of a truly historic Grand Prix-Paris!


This has been, in every way, a unique event. From the beginning of round one it was the largest Magic tournament ever held, and very rapidly it became the most brutal and unforgiving. The list of big name players falling by the wayside grew rapidly as they failed to adapt to Shards of Alara, and Grand Prix-Paris. The cull to a Top-128 for Day Two saw only 15 or 16 players of note left standing. Two of those players were Olivier Ruel and Shuuhei Nakamura, matching each other blow for blow in the Player of the Year race, and Hall of Famer Raphael Levy. In the end, though, not one of the big names was able to mount an unbeaten run into the Top-8 on the second day.


That left the Top-8 wide open to a hungry new generation of players, and it was Arjan Van Leeuwen who was the hungriest. His Jund deck Devoured his own creatures and then the opposition in the pursuit of +1/+1 counters and victory.
