Greetings **Magic** Players!


The new [**Magic Online** Sneak Peek](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-sneak-peek-available-now-2012-07-16) is in full swing and we are gathering a lot of great feedback. For all players who have tried out the new **Magic Online** beta client, we hope you are enjoying your time during the Sneak Peek and we thank you for your participation so far.


 If you haven't tried the new client yet, this is your chance to become involved and make sure your voice is heard as we decide the future of **Magic Online**. Hop on and let us know what you think before the Sneak Peek ends on July 25.


As a special treat, if you try out the new version of **Magic Online** in a tournament this weekend, we will give you an *Avacyn Restored* booster pack as an additional thank you! That's right, just log in to the new **Magic Online** Sneak Peek beta client and play in any Constructed or Limited (booster draft or sealed deck) tournament with at least 8 players and we will add an *Avacyn Restored* booster pack to your collection by July 26. Here are the full details: 


* Log into the new **Magic Online** Sneak Peek beta client between 3:00 PM PDT (22:00 UTC) on Friday, July 20, 2012 and 9:00 AM PDT (16:00 UTC) on Monday, July 23, 2012.
* Play in at least one (1) Constructed, Sealed Deck or Draft tournament event that starts during this time period using the new **Magic Online** beta client. Playing in a tournament event means that you successfully join the event or queue and complete at least one match using the new **Magic Online** beta client. As long as the event started during the listed period and you meet the play requirement listed above, you will qualify for the booster pack.
* If you meet the requirement above, we will automatically add one (1) *Avacyn Restored* booster pack to your collection by 9:00 AM PDT on Thursday, July 26.

We are very excited about the direction of **Magic Online**, but we still need your help. After you are done playing in the new **Magic Online**, make sure you take a couple minutes and fill out our [feedback](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/977005/magic-online-new-ui-sneak-peek-survey) survey or join the conversation in our [forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75846/135046/magic_online_general).


Thank you for all of your effort so far and see you in the game,   
 The **Magic Online** Team
