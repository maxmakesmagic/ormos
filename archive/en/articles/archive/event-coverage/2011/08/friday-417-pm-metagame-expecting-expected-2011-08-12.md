As always, German Nationals happen late in the season. Japan, France, USA and Italy have all found their champions and teams for Worlds already. The 195 players who came to Iserlohn to grab their piece of glory took a good look at those decks and decided that this would be their metagame, too. With four rounds of Standard done, we've asked a couple of players what they had expected to face here. The results? Not really surprising. (We'll have the metagame breakdown for you tomorrow, so you can see how the expectations of the players compared to the facts.)

*"Do you want percentages? 20 % [Caw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208279)-[Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382200), 10 % each for [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) decks, [Valakut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut), U/B, Mono-R including [Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin)s, and 7% [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel). But really, the metagame is [Caw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208279)-[Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382200) and decks that try to beat it. That's why I am playing [Caw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208279)-[Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382200)."*

*"I can beat those numbers! 21 % [Caw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208279)-[Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382200), 12 % U/B Control, 10 % [Valakut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut) and [Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pod)-Decks, then [Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel), Mono-Red and various combo decks. Really, though, percentages don't really mean much beforehand. I expected those decks, in that order of popularity."*
