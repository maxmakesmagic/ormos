If you were at the San Diego Comic Con this last weekend, you probably went to the [**Magic** panel](/en/articles/archive/magic-comic-con-2010-07-19). So you might know some of this information. Or you might not. This is being written before the convention actually happens, so things might have gone horribly wrong, in which case we're so sorry for bringing up the tragic events. This is supposed to be a time of healing.

Okay, hang on. This is getting a little out of control. The point is that if everything went well, the foil alternate-art *Duel Decks: Elspeth vs. Tezzeret* versions of [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant) and [Tezzeret the Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Seeker) should have been shown in San Diego. And now, even if you didn't get to go, or if you were in some other panel, or if you were in *line* for some other panel, you get to see them. Here. Now. Behold!

Okay, now we have *more* news. For the first time, these are being printed in languages other than English! That means French, German, Italian, and Spanish countries can look forward to seeing things like this!
