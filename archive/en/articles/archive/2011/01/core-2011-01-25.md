Last week, the *Mirrodin Besieged* [Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/mirrodinbesieged/spoiler) (which is constantly being updated, incidentally) added a card called Into the Core. Dig it:


![Into the Core](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/mbs/r79npq8yi3_en.jpg)What's happening in this card is that the Phyrexians have created a gigantic hole in Mirrodin's outer crust, causing whatever's on the surface to plummet into the fiery furnace beneath.

Now, do you see anything familiar in this piece? Maybe something that the Phyrexians might consider enough of a threat that they'd need to resort to this kind of overkill?
