 Ken Yukuhiro is a master deckbuilder. I've had the honor of working with him in Valencia. One of the great minds in the creation of Blue Moon, a deck good enough to put Lee Shi Tian into the Top 8 at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. 


Today, he is armed with an eye-raising concoction of his own and he has aptly named it the "Blue Black Heroic Draft Deck", to the amusement of anyone hearing about it.





*Always bubbly and always smiling!*
