Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:askwizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive, but if your question is good, it might show up in the coming weeks! 

**Q:** Where are the spoilers this week?


**A:** From **Trick Jarrett**, Editor-in-Chief of DailyMTG


As you may have noticed we have **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013 rolling out this week (June 20th on all platforms, time may vary depending on your geographic region and platform.) Right during what would normally have been our first week of Magic 2013 previews. As we planned out this preview season I pitched the idea of moving the first week back a week and focusing on cards that are both in ***Magic** 2013* and Duels 2013, then we would use the interim week to focus on Duels’ launch. That means you’ll see the finale of ***Magic** 2013* previews kicking off on Monday, June 25th.

**Q:** How much is *Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013* going to cost when it launches?


**A:** The *Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013* base game is priced competitively at MSRP 800 MS Points for Xbox LIVE® or MSRP $9.99/£6.99/8,99€ for your PS3 through the PlayStation® Network, for your iPad® through the App Store, and for your PC through Steam®. Prices may vary by platform and region. Go to the specific sites to verify.
