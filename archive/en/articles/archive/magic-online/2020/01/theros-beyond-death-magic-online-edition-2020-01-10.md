Theros Beyond Death: Magic Online Edition
=========================================

By Alli Medwin











Welcome back to *Magic Online*. It's 2020, we're about to release *Theros Beyond Death* (THB), and there's Gods, heroes, and monsters aplenty for everyone. Before you head off to your tabletop Prerelease, you can play THB Limited on *Magic Online* starting on Thursday, January 16. Or, if you prefer, you can trade for the cards you want and brew up a new Constructed deck and play it all weekend. (And then keep going. We're not going to judge.)


Before the THB events begin, though, we need to wrap up *Throne of Eldraine* season. Here's how that's going to work: We have scheduled downtime on Wednesday, January 15, which is planned to go until approximately noon Pacific Time. Once we're back up, we're going to be in the new post-rotation world. What that means is that all Constructed leagues will be reset: any league courses in progress will be ended, and they'll be ready to join all over again with *Theros Beyond Death* already legal. Reprints will also be legal in Standard immediately—[Underworld Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Dreams), [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light), [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), the ally-colored scry lands, etc.—even if players don't have the THB versions just yet.


And then events begin at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on Thursday, January 16.


*Theros Beyond Death* Redemption Schedule
-----------------------------------------


* *Theros Beyond Death* will be available for redemption beginning February 12.
* The *Theros Beyond Death* redemption guarantee will end April 29.
* *Theros Beyond Death* redemption will end entirely June 3.

Single-Card Stories: Furious Rise
=================================


Over recent years, *Magic Online* has added lots of little clarifying steps. We now include prompt box reminder text when appropriate, especially to steps that your opponents' cards show to you. It helps to read the card, but if you're being asked to choose from a pile of cards or game objects on the battlefield, more often than not, *Magic Online* will tell you just *why* it is you're making that choice.


R&D has been experimenting lately with more and weirder red "impulse draws." These are effects that exile cards and allow you to cast or play them later on. Some cards let you use the card later that turn. Others give you until the next turn. *Theros Beyond Death* gives us a new twist on this effect in Furious Rise.


![Furious Rise](https://media.wizards.com/2019/thb/en_oeMKkc8Xdb.png)


This duration isn't based on time, unlike those that came before. This duration is based on the next time that trigger exiles something, which isn't quite the same. If the trigger is countered, or if you don't have a card in your library to exile, or (more likely) you don't have a ferocious-enough creature to cause the ability to trigger, you're not going to exile another card with Furious Rise. And that means the permission to play the card in exile doesn't go away.


![Furious Rise with blue text](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/furious%20rise%20with%20blue%20text.png)


So we did two things here: First, cards exiled by Furious Rise have blue italic text specifying their novel duration. Second, there's an association (that's the blue arrows that appear on mouseover) between the cards, so just in case you have multiple Furious Rises, it'll be clear which card is associated with which Furious Rise.


The Avatars of *Theros Beyond Death*
====================================


There are five avatars introduced with *Theros Beyond Death*.


For new accounts and the Deck Builder's Essentials, there's the Planeswalking to Theros avatar:


![Planeswalking to Theros avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/planeswalking%20to%20theros%20avatar.png)


In a departure from most recent sets, there's only one new avatar for Treasure Chests. But he's such a good boy, I don't think anyone's going to mind much.


![Sleepy Puppy avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/sleepy%20puppy%20avatar.png)


The new Prestige Avatar system based on trophies has been working well, and it will continue through THB season. If you accumulate 5 points of trophies (one Competitive or five Friendly), at the end of the season you'll be granted this Calix Beyond Death avatar, the uncommon prestige avatar for the set. 20 points, and you'll get the rare Ashiok Beyond Death prestige avatar. And if you can accumulate 40 points, you'll get Elspeth Beyond Death, the *Theros Beyond Death* mythic prestige avatar.

Alternative Play Calendar
=========================


All events on this calendar are Phantom unless otherwise specified. This season, every event is Phantom. In the future, non-Phantom events will also be labeled as "Encore" events, rather than "Flashback," to help make the distinction more clear.


* **January 29****–****February 5: Ravnica Block Flashback.** No *Return to*, no *Guilds of*. This is the *City of Guilds*, my friends, and the *Guildpact* and *Dissension* that followed. Draft those [Selesnya Evangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Evangel)s and, I guess, other cards if you want to. There's certainly no shortage of classic cards in this block.
* **February 5****–****19: CHAOS! Draft.** For two weeks, go ahead and draft. Open those packs. It could be anything. Anything at all. (Spoiler alert: it'll be *Magic* cards.)
* **February 19****–****26: Zendikar Flashback.** [Harrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) is the best card in the set. Change my mind. (Yeah, yeah, [Windrider Eel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windrider+Eel).)
* **February 26****–****March 4: Spotlight Cube: *Khans Expanded*.** This was a very popular Spotlight Cube, and we're happy to bring Elliot Raff's creation back for another week.
* **March 4****–****11: *Hour of Devastation* Flashback.** This format has eternal appeal. Get it? Eternal? Eternalize? . . . I'll show myself out.
* **March 11****–****18: Spotlight Cube: [REDACTED].** Something new is coming. Something neat. Something . . . oddly familiar? We'll talk more about this brand-new Spotlight Cube as we get closer to it.
* **March 18****–****25: *Invasion* Block Flashback.** Back in the day, when *Magic Online* first released, *Invasion* was the block that was released not because it was current, but because otherwise we wouldn't be able to play Standard. As a result, it was never the primary Draft set, so no matter how many times we run the flashback, it'll never make up for the fact that this awesome format remains forever underdrafted.
* **March 25****–****April 16: *Modern Cube*.** The always-exciting *Modern Cube* returns for a three-week stint that wraps up THB season.
