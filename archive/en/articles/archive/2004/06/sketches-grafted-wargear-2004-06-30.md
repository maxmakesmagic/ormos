Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:)! This week we take an interactive look behind the scenes of the art of *Fifth Dawn*'s **[Grafted Wargear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Wargear)** by Alex Horley-Orlandelli.


### 1. Art Description


Once a card is designed, an art description is written to tell the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Alex for the project:



> 
> *This is gunmetal-colored Vulshok armor (see style guide) that magically grafts to the wearer's skeleton. Once someone equips this armor, they would have to rip themselves apart to remove it.* 
> 
> 
> 


Alex Horley-Orlandelli has over forty **Magic** card credits to date since *Apocalypse*, including [Quicksilver Dagger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Dagger), [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm), [Nantuko Vigilante](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Vigilante), and [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator), among others.


### 2. & 3. Sketches to Final Art


Time to get interactive. Click the buttons below the image to see the progression of sketches from the initial sketch to final art. *(Depending on your connection speed, it may take a few seconds for the image to change.)*

| The initial sketch shows a warrior in a straightforward suit of armor. The warrior has a cool pose, but the armor doesn't suggest the grafted nature of the mechanic, or the Vulshok "look." | This next sketch is definitely Volshok. It shows those heavy gauntlets like on [Forge Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Armor) and the metallic hair/headgear from [Magnetic Theft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnetic+Theft). | This final sketch keeps the Volshok look but puts more emphasis on the grafted-ness of the wargear. It's definitely attached to his bones now! | Check out our grafted friend's roar of pain and rage in the full-color final art. This is the kind of equipment the Volshok like -- it hurts, but that just makes you madder, and madder is better. |

### 4. Card


And here's how you'll see the card in its final state, in booster packs of *Fifth Dawn*.
