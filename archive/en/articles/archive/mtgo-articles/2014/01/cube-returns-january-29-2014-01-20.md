Cube Returns January 29
=======================



 Posted in **Magic Online**
 on January 21, 2014 










It's less than a month until [**Magic Online** *Born of the Gods* Prerelease Events](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01132014) begin on Friday, February 14 at 10:00 AM PST, but in the interim there's plenty that'll keep your tapping skills sharp, including the next Cube and its paired Flashback Drafts! [![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/arcana/927_cubebooster.jpg)](https://accounts.onlinegaming.wizards.com/)


The next Cube runs from January 29 until February 12!
The Cube is a special selection of 720 single **Magic**  cards, no duplicates, that is assembled by R&D. At the end of this article, you will find a [full Cube card list](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01202014#cardlist) and the cards that have changed. These cards are randomly divided into Cube booster packs that are used to run Draft and Sealed events in **Magic Online**. The cards in the **Magic Online**  Cube are changed regularly, with new cards replacing some cards in the past Cube.


This is an exciting format that is very popular among **Magic Online**  players, which only runs for short periods a few times a year. And each returning Cube has accompanying Flashback Drafts that let players relive the glory days of their favorite sets and blocks.


There are two Flashback Drafts that will run simultaneously with this Cube:



**January 29 - February 5: Mirrodin/Darksteel/Fifth Dawn**


**February 5 - February 12: Invasion/Planeshift/Apocalypse**



So, before you Awaken the Myth with *Born of the Gods*, prepare yourself with the **Magic Online**  Cube!
