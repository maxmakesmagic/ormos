*Ravnica* Throwback Standard Gauntlet Is Here!
----------------------------------------------


Whether you have fond memories of *Ravnica*-era Standard or you've always been curious about it, this Gauntlet is for you. Try out one of the era's most powerful decks (randomly selected from [this list](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/throwback-standard-gauntlet-5-ravnica-2017-08-08)) and battle against its competitors to prove that you really should have been a Pro Tour Champion back then!


Throwback Standard Gauntlets can be found in the Limited Leagues area of the *Magic Online* Play Lobby. For more information on this and other exciting events in the near future, check out Chris Kiritz's article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/state-magic-online-2018-2018-02-08).

Team Modern Super League Tonight
--------------------------------


It's Modern! It's super! It has teams! It's exactly what you think it is! If this is the first you're hearing of Team Modern Super League, that will make no sense. But that's okay! Briefly, it's a fun, entertaining series that pits three-person teams of beloved *Magic* personalities against each other in a complex Modern tournament structure that ensures a variety of decks and players wind up in the spotlight. TMSL airs Tuesdays (like this one!) at 5 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).

Banned and Restricted List Updates
----------------------------------


In case you missed [yesterday's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/february-12-2018-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2018-02-12), we just updated the Banned and Restricted list—and some Modern fans *might* be pretty excited right now! The changes will take effect on *Magic Online* on Wednesday, after a brief downtime from 9 to 10 a.m. Leagues will be paused during this time, but they will not be closed, so you'll be able to pick up right where you left off.

Two PTQs This Weekend
---------------------


This weekend brings two Pro Tour Qualifier events on *Magic Online*, both of which qualify winners for Pro Tour *Dominaria*. On Saturday, February 17, at 9 a.m. PT, the format will be Standard. There is no need to qualify for this event through a Preliminary—simply join with 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points.


Then, Sunday, February 18, at 7 a.m., a *Rivals of Ixalan-Ixalan* Sealed tournament will kick off. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required to join this event.
