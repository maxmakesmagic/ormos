After investigating the incident involving Jorge Iramain's shuffling during the finals of the World **Magic** Cup, we have determined that Jorge's search and shuffle actions did not constitute an intentional break of randomization. We will therefore take no further action.

However, we would like to remind all **Magic** players that sufficiently randomizing your deck, and your opponentâ€™s deck, maintains the integrity both of the game and of the players. We encourage everyone to adopt good shuffling techniques no matter the level of competitive play.

Additionally, if you are not comfortable with the way your opponent shuffles, we encourage you to call a judge immediately.
