2001 United States National Championship Coverage
=================================================












2001 United States National Championship Coverage
-------------------------------------------------


![National Championships Logo](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nationals_sm.jpg)![US Flag](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/worlds/images/flag_us.jpg)![Disney's Wide World of Sports](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/USNAT01/989.jpg)Fires is still the best deck in town, or so US Nationals would have you believe. Trevor Blackwell became National Champion on its consistent back. He even stole the finals in three straight games from under Brian Hegstad, who was playing what many believed to be the optimal metagame call.


These two are joined by newcomer Eugene Harvey, who also played Fires. The member of Team CMU defeated old-school pro David Bachmann in four games to earn his spot. Bachmann and his monored Ensnaring Bridge deck squared off against Harvey first in the quarterfinals, and again because of the double-elimination format.
