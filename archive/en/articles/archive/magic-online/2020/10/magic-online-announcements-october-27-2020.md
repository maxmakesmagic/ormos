*Innistrad* Flashback Draft October 28
--------------------------------------


As is Halloween tradition, players can enjoy bloodcurdling battles in the upcoming *Innistrad* Flashback Draft! Get in on all the spooky action starting Wednesday, October 28. *Innistrad* Flashback Draft runs through November 4—plenty of time to draft your favorite creepy creatures.

Updated Alternate Play Schedule
-------------------------------


The alternative play schedule that was announced in the *Zendikar Rising* set article is changing!


We like to keep everyone aware of what's coming up, so here's what you can expect to see on *Magic Online* between now and the release of *Kaldheim*:


* October 21–28: ***Innistrad* Supreme Draft**. You'll get eighteen packs randomly chosen from among *Innistrad*, *Shadows over Innistrad*, *Dark Ascension*, and *Eldritch Moon*. Then, pack by pack, you'll take two cards from each pack and build a spook-tacular 40-card Limited deck and battle against other players who have done the same.
* October 28–November 4: ***Innistrad* Flashback Draft**. This is our Halloween tradition: three packs of *Innistrad*, just the way it was in 2011. Long may it . . . uh . . . stay spooky?
* November 4–18: ***Vintage Cube***. Don't worry, this isn't replacing our end-of-year tradition of more *Vintage Cube*. But we've got a little event called the MOCS happening during this two-week run's second weekend, and it uses *Vintage Cube* as part of the competition. So, to ensure players have the ability to practice for the event, everyone gets an extra two weeks of *Vintage Cube*.
* November 18–25: **No events this week**. It's the launch weekend of *Commander Legends*, and there will be plenty of new and exciting events to play there!
* November 25–December 2: This week, a popular Cube Spotlight returns: Kyle O'Neill's ***Core Set Cube***, now updated through *Core Set 2021*! (Not to be confused with the kor set *Zendikar Rising*, which will still have full events running.)
* December 2–9: **Chaos Draft: *Masters* Sets**. For just this week, our Chaos Drafts are going to take only the top sets! Every set in this draft will be a *Masters* set, and it'll be glorious.
* December 9–16: **Supreme Draft: CHAOS!** Combining the fun of Supreme Draft with Chaos Draft, you'll draft a deck from 18 different packs. Which packs? Who knows? Enjoy the chaos!
* December 16–23: **A brand-new Cube Spotlight**. As usual, more details will come later, but this one promises to be a wheel of a good time.
* December 23–30: **Supreme Draft: *Vintage Cube***. What happens when you combine one of the most powerful formats ever with the most powerful Draft style? Yep. A week of that.
* Starting December 30 and running up until the week before *Kaldheim* releases: ***Vintage Cube***. Another update in, this time with *Commander Legends* cards in the mix. This is easily the most common request we get, so . . . we hear you. More *Vintage Cube*. This will last for a few weeks, until . . .
* The Wednesday eight days before the *Kaldheim* release, right up until we turn that set's events on: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.
