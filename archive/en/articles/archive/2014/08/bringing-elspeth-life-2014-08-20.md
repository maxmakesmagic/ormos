 One player that caused quite a few neck injuries this weekend was Dora Šabec from Slovenia. She decided to show up in an [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) cosplay this weekend! Most of the players that saw her started to take a second or third look, which isn't all too surprising once you see the level of detail she applied to her costume.

**How come you decided to show up as Elspeth this weekend?**




**Šabec:** "I just like to Cosplay and I had this costume at home. I did it for the Prerelease of *Born of the Gods*and I felt like I had to wear it again since it turned out so great."




**What were the responses like from the players that saw you?**




**Šabec:** "Everybody has been really friendly and many of the guys wanted to take pictures with me."




**Would you enjoy it more if there were more cosplayers at these events?**




**Šabec:** "I don't know. It's not too bad to be the only one since it's then easier to stand out in the crowd."




**How many cosplays did you create already?**




**Šabec:** "I usually do around one cosplay per year. Carneval is a big deal in Slovenia and I always want to show up there with a unique costume. That's how I first got into it."




**And do you always cosplay **Magic** characters?** 




**Šabec:** "This is the first time I did a **Magic** cosplay, so that's new for me. I do enjoy it a lot though, mostly for its fantasy background. I'm starting to get more into the game as well, but I have only been playing it for two months."






*The stunning Elspeth costume that Dora Šabec created!*

  

**I saw that you're running a white and black deck. Do you also run Elspeth?**




**Šabec:** "Sadly, I don't own the card; as soon as I open one, I'll add her to my decks. I promise to never sell her!"




**Will we see you more often at the larger events from now on?**




**Šabec:** "I will probably attend all the events we have in Slovenia as well as the Grand Prix that are somewhat close to me. It's quite a hassle to transport all the parts of the costume to the event venue and this only really works when we can drive there like we did this weekend. Who knows, I might show up in Warsaw again with the costume."




**Will you also start cosplaying other **Magic** characters or will you stick with Elspeth?** 




**Šabec:** "There's a chance I'll create a new costume for the next Prerelease. It feels more special if you only wear them a few select times rather than all the time. It's just nice to make a new costume every once in a while."




**Thank you for the quick interview!**
