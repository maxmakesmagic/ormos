The last round of the first day started around half past twelve at night. Mike Pustilnik and Luis Sousa were both undefeated, and they were both looking for a perfect 7-0 record. Both of them had three byes, Sousa had actually won a Grand Prix Trial tournament to earn the byes.

Sosa won the die roll, and he wanted Pustilnik to play first. Pustilnik was quite happy with that. He cast a second turn Deepwood Drummer, a third turn Silt Crawler and a fourth turn Wild Jhovall and started the beatdown. Sousa got out a turn two Agent of Shauku and then a turn four Shield Dancer, and he also took care of the Deepwood Drummer by using a Steal Strength.
  
  
Still, the assault continued. Pustilnik played a Spur Grappler, and as Sousa didn't do anything, he dropped a Warmonger during his next turn, declared his attack phase, floated mana to make the Grappler bigger and finally activated the Monger for one. Finding himself at one life, Sousa conceded.
  
  
**Game One Result: Pustilnik 1 - Sousa 0**
  
  
In the second game, Sousa changed tactics and chose to play first. He dropped two lands and a Shield Dancer, so Pustilnik was happy to play a Spidersilk Armor before casting his Wild Jhovall. But alas, the Armor was Abolished and Sousa then played a Giant Caterpillar, a Boa Constrictor and a Defiant Vanguard.
  
  
Since Sousa frequently tapped out so that he was unable to activate the Shield Dancer, Mike slapped a Treetop Bracers on the Jhovall and started attacking back. Three attacks later, Sousa was at eight life while Pustilnik was at twelve after trading a Spur Grappler for the Boa. Pustilnik then cast a Living Terrain, setting up for the final kill.
  
  
Sousa, blissfully unaware of what was to come, summoned a Rathi Intimidator and said go. Pustilnik happily untapped. Then he blew away three of Sousa's creatures with a Volcanic Wind for six... Sousa sighed, and scooped.
  
  
**Final Result: Mike Pustilnik 2 - Sousa 0**
