**JUNE EPISODE**


* [*Tenth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/tenthedition) is almost here. But before we get to its **Magic** Game Day release on July 14, we have a little more time to whet your appetite. Director of Magic R&D Aaron Forsythe has the scoop on all the cool new additions to the core set: black borders, Legends, tips and tricks cards, and much more. He may have even let out a few cards that weren't public knowledge yet. But hey, he's the director -- who's going to stop him?
* Aaron sticks around for the second segment, which focuses on theme decks. *Tenth Edition*features [five different mono-colored decks](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1343), each showcasing one of that color's Legends -- from Cho-Manno's Resolve to Molimo's Might. He also talks about the steps R&D takes in creating theme decks (whether for a core set or a block), plus how theme decks have influenced card creation and vice versa.
* June's almost over, but not before the pros hit the beach at [Pro Tour-San Diego](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/sandiego07). The Two-Headed Giant Booster Draft action starts June 29, with the conclusion coming live on camera during the Top 4 webcast. Tune your computers to [archive.wizards.com/webcast](http://archive.wizards.com/webcast) at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, July 1 to see every pick and play. Let's not forget about the big day itself: [Worldwide Magic Game Day, July 14](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday). More than 2,000 locations around the world have signed up, so there's bound to be a place near you. Get your hands on the new core set, meet new players in your area, and take part in the biggest **Magic** day of the year.
