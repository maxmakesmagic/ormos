Welcome to a supplemental edition of **[Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) Watch**. In this recurring sub-feature of Magic Arcana, we keep track of what creature types that auto-updating *Legions* creature has recently become, and in effect, what creature types are part of **Magic**.


In today's case, we can report that [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) will actually *lose* one creature type in the near future -- but the card will still be functionally the same.


As Mark Rosewater's article [last week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr139) described, once *Champions of Kamigawa* becomes legal in tournaments, the Legend subtype will be replaced by the Legendary supertype. A "Creature - Bird Soldier Legend" (like [Major Teroh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Major+Teroh)) will become a "Legendary Creature - Bird Soldier" instead, bringing it in line with legendary [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mindslaver) and [Tolarian Academy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tolarian%2BAcademy). 


So what happens to our pal [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus)? The same thing. He will still be a legend, but he will be so in virtue of his new Legendary supertype as opposed to his Legend subtype. His new Oracle text type line will be "Legendary Creature - Illusion." (Of course, the "Illusion" part is still there just for flavor -- he's all the other creature types too.) 


The next edition of [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) Watch will be in October, after the release of *Champions of Kamigawa*, when the Ultimus takes up his katana and becomes a Samurai, among other things...


To summarize, after *Fifth Dawn*, [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is a:
