GRAND PRIX VIENNA 2008
----------------------


Polish Level Blue Polishes Off Dredge
=====================================




March 15-16












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Champion-Mateusz-Kope.jpg) *Champion Mateusz Kope* While the story of Grand Prix Vienna may have been [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), which positioned four players in the top eight, including Player of the Year Tomoharu Saitou and Grand Prix Vienna 2004 winner Nikolaus Eisner, the lightning fast graveyard based beatdown deck did not take the crown.


In the latest variation of levels of blue, Polish Level Blue, a blue green black control deck strongly influenced by Paul Cheon's winning deck from Grand Prix Vancouver was the choice of champions. Mateusz Kopec now not only walks away with a trophy, Pro Tour invite and a fat check, but also the knowledge that he was triumphant in the largest Extended Grand Prix of all time!


This tournament has been a huge amount of fun for both staff and players, and has highlighted the power of choosing the right deck for the day. With no more Extended for a while now, it remains to be seen if [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) remains as big a part of the metagame as it has been this weekend, but even if it is not, there are lessons to be learned here. If there is a very powerful deck in the format, you need a very good plan.


Congratulations again to Mateusz Kopec, Grand Prix Vienna 2008 Champion!

March 16th – What's the Pole Position?
--------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

The Formula One season got underway this weekend, and here in Vienna there was no shortage of high-octane thrills and spills, including a little-heralded Pole, looking to make a slice of GP history. How far could Mattheusz Kopec go in his quest for the chequered flag? Click here for the full pulse-pounding story of a great Top 8. Thanks for listening, and see you all in Brussels!

Quarterfinals – Saitou's Ideal Matchup
--------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Saitou.jpg)*Smiling Saito with a good matchup in the quarter finals* Coming into this top eight, while Tomoharu Saitou may have snuck in in eighth, he must have felt pretty good about his chances. With the deck of the tournament in [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), the Player of the Year had both had fun and decimated much of the field. He even had a favourable matchup in the quarterfinals, in the form of [Enduring Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal).


Ideal was the second most represented deck in day two, but unlike [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), it only had a single player in the top eight. Gianluca Bevere of Milan, Italy, whose previous Magic achievements were placing around 70th at Pro Tour Yokohama, had managed to finish top of the Swiss though, so he clearly has some skills. The 33 year old manga translator had to feel that he had a rough matchup in [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), but was happy to have qualified for Pro Tour Hollywood and won some money already, in what was originally planned to be a fun weekend spent with friends, without expectations.


Saitou kept his opener on the play, and led with a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), discarding [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath) and [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp). A pretty solid start. From Bevere, there was as much pressure as he could reasonably apply, in a [Tinder Farm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinder+Farm) and a pair of suspended copies of [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom).


Saitou's turn two draw step dredged him to a Bridge From Below, [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) in the graveyard, along with various other less useful dredgers. He played a second land and surveyed his hand intently. Finally he played [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) with X as 1. The very first dredge hit a second Grave-Troll, but from there he ran out of dredgers, and had to draw cards before discarding down to one. One of the cards Saito drew was the third Grave-Troll, meaning that turn 3 would likely be messy.


In his third upkeep, Saitou returned [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) to play, before dredging a Grave-Troll again. He hit a [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), and carefully counted the rest of his library before continuing. There was another [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough), and when Saitou hit a [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), meaning that he had sufficient creatures to cast [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), off the first replaced draw, Bevere scooped up his cards. There was no point making Saitou go through the motions.


Gianluca Bevere 0 – 1 Tomoharu Saitou


As first games in a set go, Saitou's Game 1 was pretty straightforward. Against [Enduring Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal), he knew it was a straight up race that he should normally win. For games 2 and 3 though, there would be some very telling resistance that Bevere could put up. Both [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) and [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) lay in Bevere's sideboard, and some combination of the two could make Saitou's plan much tougher to achieve. He had mentioned prior to the top 8 starting that a pair of turn 0 Leylines essentially spelled game over for him. For Saitou, this was where the match really started.


Game 2 started out somewhat rougher for Saitou. Gianluca was quick to keep his seven, suggesting a hand with some level of disruption. Saitou took a mulligan on his opener, and then shipped back his six also. [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) is a deck that is more resilient than most to having a lower starting hand size, and it may well be that he was looking for a [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) from the start.


Bevere had a turn 0 [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void), but Saitou nearly bounced in his chair with glee when he found that that was the only disruption before the game started. He cracked a fetchland to find [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave), and cast [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp).


On his turn two, thanks to a basic land, Bevere had a [Pentad Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism) with two counters. The much replicated Saitou Slaps began on his turn two. He attacked with [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) before waking himself up with a slap on the cheek. One Cephalid Colisseum later, it was Bevere's turn again. After a little thought, Bevere again played a [Pentad Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentad+Prism), along with a [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) for [Enduring Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal). The clock was on Saitou, and he played [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) on [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) at the end of turn.


Saitou had nothing to discard to [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) during upkeep, and winced a little before drawing his card for the turn. He cast [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) with X as 1, drawing all the cards, and discarding his hand, which now included [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp).


A [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) followed, which got him a [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) to dredge, and a [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), but did not find a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to keep him in the game by getting rid of [Enduring Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal). Saitou was tense now, carefully fanning out his graveyard and studying it to work out if he could have done something differently.


Bevere untapped and cast [Solitary Confinement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement). This was another threat for Saitou to deal with, and there were only so many [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor)s he could have. Tomoharu was forced to draw for his turn, and then activate Cephalid Colisseum to dig for an answer. He did not find one though. When [Enduring Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal) came along the following turn, fetching [Dovescape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape), Saitou scooped up his cards and declared "Next game!"


Gianluca Bevere 1 – 1 Tomoharu Saitou


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Gianluca-Bevere.jpg)*Gianluca Bevere from Milan, Italy* For the final game, dredge would be on the play, which would effectively give Tomoharu an extra turn in which to find answers to sideboard cards before Bevere could finish him. If it turned out that such cards weren't forthcoming, he would be heavy favourite, but if they were, he'd need all the time he could get.


Bevere peeked at his hand one card at a time, looking for something to slow Saitou down. There was nothing there though, meaning a swift mulligan. Good news for Tomoharu. While decks certainly *can* mulligan to answers against [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), any time they do so, it is at the expense of their win conditions.


Bevere's six card hand drew a look suggesting it was worse than his seven. He shuffled it back in and went for another go. The five he kept.


"No Leyline?"


"No Leyline... so sorry!"


Saitou smiled and got on with his plan. A turn one [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) let him discard [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) and [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return). Bevere patted his deck affectionately, hoping it would bring him some love. The Italian did have a turn one [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) and [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), but at this point his best chance was to get a [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) down, and he didn't have long to do so.


Saitou dredged back his Grave-Troll on turn two, and thought for a while before playing a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), which could only dredge the once, as Saitou was still a little short on dredgers. With a second land, Tomoharu did have another play though, which was to use [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) on [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), lessening the chance of that Crypt.


Saitou on his turn got back an [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid), before using Cephalid Colisseum to dredge back three [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll)s. He hit, amongst other things, two copies of Bridge From Below, and two [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)s. With 3 creatures on the board, Saitou could cast [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) to get a [Flame-Kin Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame-Kin+Zealot) and six zombie tokens. When the team attacked, that was enough.


Tomoharu Saito wins 2 – 1




Quarterfinals – Wojciech Zuber vs. Matija Vlahovic
--------------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

These two are playing in their first GP top 8, trying now to make that a GP top 4. Zuber is with [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), while Vlahovic is running blue-green Urzatron with one maindeck [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) and three [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West).


As it turned out Vlahovic didn't even need [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West). His opening seven luckily contained the lone Crypt. But still, it is only a one-shot answer – at least as long as he doesn't get [Academy Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins) as well. In turn three he was finally forced to crack the Crypt, but before that, Zuber did get one [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) into play, which joined forces with [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) to attack Vlahovic down to 16. Then Zuber discarded two [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) to his Imp, trading his [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) for two zombies to at least keep up a minimum of pressure.


Turn six, however, saw Vlahovic transmute his [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) for [Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower). With his newly completed Urzatron he then cast [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel), forcing a concession from Zuber, whose deck doesn't have a way to overcome the flying life insurance.


Zuber 0 – 1 Vlahovic


Zuber sideboarded:


+ 4 [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle)  



Vlahovic sideboarded:


+ 3 [Venser, Shaper Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant)  

+ 3 [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt)  

- 1 [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion)  

- 1 [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven)  

- 1 [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace)  

- 1 [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver)  

- 1 [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan)  

- 1 [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend)


Zuber played first and got off to a really good start, with [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) on turn one followed by [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) (X = 1) on the next.That was not quite enough, as Zuber missed another dredge card to keep his deck going (going into his graveyard, that is). Vlahovic topdecked Tormod' Crypt and got rid of quite a good graveyard, now basically stuffed with dredge cards. The one card Zuber had been hanging on to, turned out to be yet another Breakthrouh, but unfortunately that didn't turn up any more dredge cards. Meanwhile Vlahovic got to cast [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) for [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West), [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), the missing tron piece, and [Academy Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins).


On his next turn, Vlahovic played [Simic Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Signet), and transmuted [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) into [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt). Without [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) anytime soon, things would soon be getting unwinnable for Zuber. [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) again sealed the deal.


Matija Vlahovic wins 2-0 and advances to the semifinals.




Semifinals – Mulligan Madness
-----------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

For the semi-finals we have a historic match. Nikolaus Eigner's last Magic tournament was Pro Tour San Diego, while Saito is the reigning Player of the Year. However, Eigner has something of a history with Grand Prix Vienna. In 2004 he beat Antoine Ruel to become the champion of the last Grand Prix Vienna. If he wins two more rounds he will be the first person ever to defend their 'home' Grand Prix.


Both players played Dredge at this event, and revelled in how well it had worked for them given the metagame. Saitou was hesitant to call it the best deck, but he would concede that it was the best deck for this tournament. Both he and his friend Yui Tagaki finished well in the money with the same 75 cards. For Saito this is nothing new, but for Tagaki, who has just qualified as a doctor, and was treating the trip as a holiday before starting work, it was something a little more. Now qualified for Hollywood, Tagaki , who finished in 12th, had quite a trip.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Saitou%20rocked%20up%20ready%20to%20play.jpg)*Saitou is rocked up and ready to play.*For the dredge mirror, there would be a large component of the match coming down to the luck of the draw, and indeed the die roll. Saitou gleefully declared that he would play first in Game 1 when Eigner rolled a 1 on the 20 sided die he was offered. Even when he had to mulligan all the way down to three, he seemed up-beat about the match.


"Surely you can't win if you mulligan to 3!?"


Saitou simply nodded his head with a smile.


"Three is ok, three is ok!"


As Saitou looked at his three, it was unclear that this was true in this case though. With [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast) and [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough), he elected to mulligan to two. The Player of the Year would make history if he somehow won this one.


On two cards he chose to keep, played [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) and passed. Eigner had a turn one [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp), and end of turn [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) to dredge. When on his own turn, Eigner discarded another Grave-Troll and cast [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough), that was enough for Saito to scoop up (if that is the word for one land) his cards an move on to the second game.


"I guess that's the way you win in this matchup on the draw!"


Nikolaus Eigner 1 – 0 Tomoharu Saitou


Vienna's own was just one game away from getting to the final. Now the sideboard cards would come in on both sides. When they played in the Swiss rounds, Eigner was victorious having lost game 1, thanks to beating the hate in one game, and having double [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) in the decider.


Saitou was understandably quite keen to shuffle a great deal after having had so poor a set of draws in Game 1. Thus far the shuffling in the match had taken significantly longer than the abortive game 1.


On the play again, Saitou took his sixth mulligan of the match. While his opener had contained a [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) to contain [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) from Eigner, it had neither disruption nor the sort of start that would secure him victory.


The six card hand was much closer. With two copies of [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough), [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), land, [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) and Bridge From Below, the hand would be able to battle anything but [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void), against which it could be a lame duck. Saitou shipped it back.


"Three Leyline please" asked Saitou of his deck.


It didn't appear to be listening to him. His five card hand had [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) and [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll), along with lands, which would have to be good enough. When he declared that he would keep, he got a round of applause from his opponent and the crowd.


Again Eigner kept his seven, and this time, he had a turn zero [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void). This stopped any nonsense from Saitou turn one. Eigner had a turn one [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp), but no end of turn discard of a dredger. When Saitou cast a [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), Eigner's turn was reduced to playing a [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) of his own before passing.


A [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) from Eigner did not find any dredgers, but there was a Bridge From Below that meant that when [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)'s traded, Eigner did very much better on the deal. Leyline even meant that his Bridge hung around. Eigner looked to seal the deal with a second [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void), this time 'hard cast'. Saitou would need a miracle at this point to take the game, in the form of back to back [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor), along with some gas to allow him to win fast having done so before the got replayed.


Saito cast a second [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) and passed. His two Imps double blocked a Zombie, but when Eigner cast [Cephalid Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Sage), Saito placed his score pad on the table, and beckoned Eigner to flip it over. The message was pretty clear.

Finals – A little bit of history repeating?
-------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

If you assume that every player that shows up to a Grand Prix has an equal chance of winning, the chances of Nikolaus Eigner winning both GP Viennas would be 1,119,379 to one. We know though, that the right player, on the right day, with the right deck, can shorten these odds a lot.


Eigner's choice of Dredge for this tournament has turned out to be a very good one, in a field that must surely be described as unprepared given the deck's performance over the weekend. Eigner had to win a pair of Dredge mirrors to make the final, but upon arrival, he felt confident that he could achieve the impossible.


His opponent, Mateusz Kopeć, is playing an evolution of Paul Cheon's Previous Level Blue, which has been dubbed Polish Level Blue, after his homeland. Notable for its lack of [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) as much as its additions, it has proven effective all weekend, and is one match short of taking its designer all the way.


"I was so happy when Vancouver was all about blue decks... people stopped preparing for Dredge, and now I'm here!" declared Eigner, shortly after winning the die roll.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/ShuffleUp.jpg)*Shuffle up, it's time for the finals*


His seven card hand was a tricky choice regarding mulligans. It had [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave), a pair of copies of [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough), [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug), [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) and [Flame-Kin Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame-Kin+Zealot). After a good degree of thought, Eigner chose to keep. Ideally he'd want to get a second land to cast [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) for one (keeping the second [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough)) at which point he'd be able to dredge a huge amount. In the matchup though, he may have been tempted to go super aggressive, and get his Dredge outlets in the right place before any of Kopeć's counterspells could get online.


Kopeć had a double mulligan.


"Do you want to do it like Saitou? If you mulligan to two as well, people will think that I have some special shuffle."


In fact, the three land, two [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) hand was just not equipped to do what it needed to. Kopeć kept on five.


For the first turn Eigner played [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) targeting himself, to allow himself to discard [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll). This meant that the following turn he could cast [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) with X as zero, and dredge quite a bit. He finished up with two [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)s in play, along with [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Dread Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) to play with, but nary a Bridge From Below was to be seen.


Kopeć was calmly sitting back and watching, without a great deal of action beyond using some fetchlands. Eigner got to return [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid), but his dredges still didn't find him a Bridge. [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) got stuck in before being sacrificed to [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), ripping a pair of [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s from Kopeć's hand. Kopeć had just two land in play, and was left with a [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) and a pair of [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) in hand. The game was Eigner's to win or lose.


When Kopeć drew for his turn, the crowd behind him all started laughing, and it soon became clear why. The lone maindeck [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) was there, and suddenly all the game that Eigner had was a pair of 1/1 flyers attacking in each turn.


While Kopeć was definitely fortunate to have found his [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt), he was still stuck on 2 land, without any form of gas. [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)'s attacked him to three, and Kopeć was forced to [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) a third to stay alive. He drew for his turn though, and there was no help. In spite of [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt), Kopeć had to scoop it up.


Nikolaus Eigner 1 – 0 Mateusz Kopeć


For Game 2, Eigner's life would be a little tougher. A set of [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) plus [Extirpate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate)s joined that lone [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt), and could prove problematic. If anything [Extirpate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) is the trickiest hate card for Dredge to fight against, as it is one that they can't see coming or easily answer with a spell of their own. For Eigner, the tense times were all ahead, with victory in sight.


Eigner watched Kopeć as the Pole surveyed his opening seven.


"You looked at your deck... that looks like a mulligan to me."


It seemed that Eigner had the measure of his opponent, as Kopeć did indeed go down to six before keeping. Eigner was happy with his seven, but presumably less happy to see a turn zero [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void). He cast [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) naming [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) and passed.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Breakthrough%20into%20Chain%20of%20Vapor%20offers%20Eigner%20hope.jpg)*Breakthrough into Chain of Vapor offers Eigner hope*It appeared that Kopeć had taken quite a gamble on that Leyline hand, as he was without a second land, meaning that Eigner's optimistic plan of a hard cast [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) and some beats didn't look so bad. Kopeć played [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), and Eigner struck back with [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) where X equaled 2. He drew into [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor), and found himself with the spell plus a [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) when it resolved.


When a [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) joined Eigner's hand it seemed that the fight might be on. [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) successfully bounced that darned Leyline, and [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) joined the team. Kopeć went in for some slightly frantic Toppery. He had his third land for the turn, and a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), leaving black mana up. [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) didn't get hit by [Extirpate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) when it was discarded to the Imp, but there was a [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) to stop Cephalid Colisseum from allowing Eigner's deck to go nuts.


Kopeć again played a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and passed. On 11 from flying beats, he was facing down a force, but for the first time threatening back. [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) came back for the turn, and after beating for 3 in the air, Eigner flashed back [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) naming [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles). He saw [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), Leyline and [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives). With one Bridge From Below, Eigner's blockers were pretty solid, turning into zombies upon death, but Kopeć's [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives), which came down set to zero, would be a problem. Eigner sat back on defence. Kopeć was gradually making life more and more difficult for him. He got up to three [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s, and had [Miren, the Moaning Well](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Miren%2C+the+Moaning+Well) to stymie Bridge From Below tricks if necessary. There were those Explosives. Eigner had some hoops to jump through to get to the final 8 points of damage. His dredges were a virtual blank, but the [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) in Eigner's graveyard came back to attack Eigner to one. He couldn't stop the swing back though, and succumbed to a team of lhurgoyfs who were hefty thanks to the size of his graveyard.


Nikolaus Eigner 1 – 1 Mateusz Kopeć


The crowd around this Grand Prix final was one of the largest in recent European Grand Prix history. With Eigner being a local player, he had a great deal of support, while there was definitely also a contingent of Poles who seemed keen to let Kopeć know that he wasn't alone in these finals.


On the play Eigner found himself forced to mulligan to five. He chose to keep with a pair of copies of [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough), [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) and an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Would it be good enough when Kopeć had already shown himself willing to mulligan aggressively into [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void)? Kopeć did ship back his seven for a new six, which he kept, thanks to a Leyline. He had a suspended [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s to follow, but had to smile and shake his head when he again saw a [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) ready to attack on the other side of the board.


A [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) tried to join the illusion, but with a declaration of "That's quite scary" Kopeć said no in classic fashion, with a [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). He had a [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) to transmute for [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) also, making Eigner's main plan all the harder.

Helped by the pain of fetchlands, that lone [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) took Kopeć to 13. Eigner played a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), looking for answers, and then a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), successfully hitting [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) in Kopeć's hand.


While Kopeć was essentially playing draw go, Eigner got in his little hits, and played a [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) for two, netting that [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) he knew about. A second [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) for two the turn later resolved, but didn't find the Austrian much help. Kopeć was ready to go on the offensive, and played a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).


Eigner had yet another [Breakthrough](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough), this time for three. He attacked Kopeć to nine. After taking a 3 point hit from [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), he got in again, before playing [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp). The flyer hit play, and Eigner passed.


Kopeć's play was an [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) for 3, which he immediately popped. Nikolaus seemed ready for this, with a [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) to bounce first his [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp), and then [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). When Stinky came back, there was a [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) waiting.


[Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) was going all the way, getting Kopeć down to six before Eigner played a new [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp). His troublesome flyers forced Kopeć to Top, sacrifice a fetchland for the shuffle effect, then Top again. He couldn't stop the Imp from resolving though, and frowned a little at the situation he was in.


[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) knocked Eigner down to five, before [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) came out from Kopeć. This appeared bad for Eigner, but he was willing to push the tempo with an [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid). This forced Kopeć to sacrifice his [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to [Miren, the Moaning Well](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Miren%2C+the+Moaning+Well), just to stay alive, on five life. Eigner cast [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) on his own [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) to set up for more attacks of a similar nature for the following turn, and copied it onto [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles).


Kopeć played [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and those Shackles again. One swing from [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) would be enough to finish Eigner, and with the Shackles to steal [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) it looked that the Viennese dream might be shattered at the last. Eigner cast [Putrid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp), and let his [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) die blocking the lhurgoyf. He was fighting a losing battle though. When Kopeć sacrificed the stolen [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) to [Miren, the Moaning Well](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Miren%2C+the+Moaning+Well), that battle was too much though. Eigner extended his hand. He was beaten.


Congratulations to Mateusz Kopeć, Grand Prix Vienna 2008 Champion!
