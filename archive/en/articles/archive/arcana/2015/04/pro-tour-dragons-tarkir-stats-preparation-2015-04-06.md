Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






It's that time of the season again, as Paul Jordan—otherwise known to the Internets as [@magicPJ](http://www.twitter.com/magicPJ), or the *Magic* Stat Guy—fires up his Pro Tour stat machine and starts flooding the Twitterverse with Pro Tour factoids like this:





> 
> 1 person qualified for [#PTDTK](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PTDTK?src=hash) 5 ways. None of them were [#mtghof](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtghof?src=hash). Who is it?

I'll give you a moment—and some space—to register your guess.



Go ahead, write it down. I'll wait.

Or, as Rich Hagon would say "Mar-tin Yoo-zah!"



This factoid is from March, but Paul has already started his flood of Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* tweets. It's the best, easiest way to find out the top Limited win percentage among pros over the last decade, or who has the highest Standard win percentage (Brad Nelson).



Do you want answers? Then [@magicPJ](http://www.twitter.com/magicPJ) has them.
