### Love Janse vs. Guillaume Wafo-Tapa


Love Janse, bearer of the Swedish Fish (Shark, actually) of Triumph, is in the Top 4 of the World Championships—and his very first Pro Tour. Conceivably, he could win Rookie of the Year by finishing well enough today. His opponent has the somewhat greater experience of the two. Guillaume Wafo-Tapa has won a Pro Tour in Japan before, in Yokohama. This time he is playing for a World Champion title with a deck he piloted to a 6-0 finish in the Standard portion of the event.


**Game 1**


Guillaume led with [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), seeing two [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan); [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement); [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn); and lands—nothing that he could take. Of those lands, there were some pretty nice ones, including [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) and [Eldrazi Temple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple). That Battlement soon came down, and Janse followed up with a [Growth Spasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Growth+Spasm), getting Janse well toward being able to cast [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) well early.

*Sweden's Love Janse and France's Guillaume Wafo-Tapa face off in the semis.*


An [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) whiffed, seeing just Forest, those two Titans, and [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn). Janse seemed happy enough with that, and even happier for his first Titan to resolve without incident. He fetched a pair of copies of [Eldrazi Temple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple) with it, suddenly getting very close to Emrakul mana. That was enough for Guillaume, stuck on 3 lands, to nod his head and scoop up his cards. It was on to Game 2.


Janse 1, Wafo-Tapa 0


**Game 2**


Game 1 took less time than the sideboarding and shuffling for Game 2. It was again all about Janse in the early game, resolving an [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) to get ahead on the land count, and then an [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya), revealing an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) on the top of his deck. Wafo-Tapa killed the 2/2 with [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) at the end of turn.


[Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) came next from Wafo-Tapa, immediately putting that [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) from the top of Janse's deck to the bottom. Janse seemed unrattled by the Planeswalker. He cast a second Oracle of Mul-Daya, then played the [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden)s from the top of his deck, before another land and a pass.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/sf2_janse.jpg)  
*Love Janse has made it this far, but can he topple the Wafo-Tapa wall?*


Wafo-Tapa used Jace to [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), then cast [Memoricide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) to remove the [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)s from Janse's deck and check out his sideboard plan. It proved a timely decision; there were a pair of [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)s in Janse's hand, along with [Eldrazi Temple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple) and [Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Infinite+Gyre). After the shuffle, there was a [Joraga Treespeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Treespeaker) on the top of Janse's deck. After his draw, there was an [Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) up there, which Janse immediately played. [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) worked on keeping down Jace a little before the Treespeaker came down for Janse, and leveled up to level 3.


Wafo-Tapa had a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), to make all that leveling up on the Treespeaker seem unnecessary. He had another to kill off the Oracle. With Wafo-Tapa low on mana untapped, Janse used his opportunity to cast [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap), but only got an [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) for his trouble. Wafo-Tapa bounced the wall, before casting a [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan).


Now that the French player was the one with a threat on the board, the whole face of the game changed. A [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) took away the threat of [Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin). [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) cleared the wall out of the way, and Wafo-Tapa was coming out swinging. [Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Infinite+Gyre) killed the Titan, but it had already done part of its job, making four zombie tokens. Wafo-Tapa bounced the Eldrazi on his turn rather than face the annihilator, and cast a second [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). From here the indestructible 11/11 just wasn't good enough, and Janse scooped up his cards.


Janse 1, Wafo-Tapa 1


**Game 3**


Janse had some acceleration in the form of [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), but was left with no access to coloured mana (or at least useful) coloured mana when his Forest was hit by [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). A [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden) met [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), and it seemed that Wafo-Tapa might be able to parlay his opponent's mana issues into a win.


A topdecked Forest changed all that. It allowed for [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) and a second Forest, revealing an [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) on the top of his deck. The Oracle was soon hit by [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) from Guillaume, who resolved another [Memoricide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) on [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), taking one in Janse's hand and the rest from his deck. It also showed three [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) and [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) still to be sat, ready to cast.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/sf2_wafo-tapa2.jpg)  
*Formats come and go, but Wafo-Tapa's dedication to control is nearly as unwavering as his expression.*


Guillaume wasn't going to sit back forever. He cast a [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), in readiness for entering the red zone. There was not much love on the top of Janse's deck, and thanks to [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya), everyone knew it.


The Titan began to swing with its team, and when an [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) was countered by Wafo-Tapa, that was enough for Janse to scoop up and move on.


Wafo-Tapa 2, Janse 1


The acceleration plan for Janse in Game 4 began with [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for 1. It followed with a [Growth Spasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Growth+Spasm), which was countered, and no third land. When [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) came from Wafo-Tapa, he saw Ulamog, [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), [Growth Spasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Growth+Spasm), and [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap). The [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) went, and a second [Growth Spasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Growth+Spasm) was countered. Wafo-Tapa had no intention of being the one to miss land drops, and cast a [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) to keep his hand fueled.


Janse finally got things moving with a resolved [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), and a [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), but by this point, Wafo-Tapa was ready to [Memoricide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) away [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). Janse's hand was now [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), Ulamog, and [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap). With four mana available, only one of these looked particularly castable to Janse.


The [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) found the Swede a land, but he still seemed pretty far behind. Wafo-Tapa used the last counter on [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) to draw a card and replaced it with [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). He used the [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) ability, before playing out a fetch land to engineer the shuffling away of bad cards. He had a [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) all ready to keep Janse off mana, but it wasn't as good as it could have been, as Janse cast an [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) and then hit two lucky lands off the top, revealing a Tectionic Edge for next turn.


After a little thought, Wafo-Tapa played [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on [Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) and passed. He had a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) ready for [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya), and another ready for when Janse cast and leveled up a [Joraga Treespeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Treespeaker). A second [Memoricide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) took [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap)s out of Janse's deck, leaving Janse with a hand of just [Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Infinite+Gyre).


It was time for [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) to start fatesealing Janse with his +2 ability. Wafo-Tapa had a [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) to follow, and a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) ready for Ulamog (though he could not stop it from killing off his [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan)).

*When Ulamog isn't enough: Love Janse feels the jaws of defeat closing around him.*


Jace continued to fateseal, going up to 7 counters. [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) was deemed safe to leave on top, and Wafo-Tapa got in some attacks, to take Janse to 13 life. Wafo-Tapa was perilously close to the victory now, and used Jace to [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). He found a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) for the Oracle, and a [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) for [Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze). Another [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) sealed it.


Guillaume Wafo-Tapa defeats Love Janse 3-1 and advances to the Finals!
