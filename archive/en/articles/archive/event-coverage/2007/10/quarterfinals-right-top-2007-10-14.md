Welcome to the Quarterfinals of PT–Valencia. Coming into the Pro Tour one of the prevailing theories was that the Extended metagame was so wide open that it would be difficult for control decks to thrive facing so many different threats to try and contain. This hasn't proved to be the case as the aggro decks mostly got eaten alive with only an Affinity and a Zoo deck surviving to the final stages.


This Quarterfinal pits two previously unknown players, Remi Fortier of France and Tine Rus of Slovenia, against each other. Initially I'd been told this was a Gifts Rock mirror and I was tempted to bring in a pillow or possibly a heavy injection of caffeine to get me through the long protracted war of attrition that would have meant. Fortunately the information was incorrect. Fortier is running a [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) / [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) control deck with [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant)s and [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s. When I asked him beforehand he didn't feel too confident about the matchup. [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) isn't so good when your opponent's threats are fairly expensive, and [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) is rather one-sided when it only blows up your stuff. 


### Game 1


After a mulligan Rus led off with a [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) naming [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). The Therapy whiffed and Fortier was able to use a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) to power out [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) on turn one. On turn two he summoned a [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) to fetch the other part of the combo: [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). He couldn't really ask for a better start in the Quarterfinal.


Rus went for a [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish), only for the Top to float a [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) to the top of Fortier's library for [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) to counter it. With the added security of a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) in hand, Fortier was in a dominant position. His [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) continued to whittle down his opponent's life total.


Rus next tried for Collective Restraint to lock out the red zone. Fortier didn't bother trying to spin the top and instead used one of his hard [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s to say no. Next turn Rus went fishing with [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to see if the way was clear for his [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth). It wasn't. [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) took care of the [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and a second hard [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) sent the Baloth packing.


Fortier looked to be in total control, but made a slight blip when he forgot to attack with the [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) for a turn. It was unimportant. [Venser, Shaper Savant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant) was on hand to delay Rus's [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), and by the time Rus got to untap to try again he couldn't find an answer he could play in the same turn.


Fortier 1, Rus 0


### Game 2


Rus opened with [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) this time and probably wished it was [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy); Fortier had two [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) in hand. He also had two land, a [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage), and Venser. So this time the normally reliable [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) managed to whiff, effectively balancing out the mulligan Fortier had been forced to take.


This game Rus had the fast start (for Gifts Rock anyway!). A second-turn [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) allowed him to power out a third turn [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). This netted him a [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) and [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) and Fortier put an [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) and [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) in the graveyard.


Fortier fetched [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) with the ever-useful [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). His second-turn [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) perished to [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) and with a [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) in play Rus looked set to start grinding it out.


At the end of Rus's turn Fortier tried to find a bit of gas with [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). Rus took the opportunity of his opponent being tapped out to fire off a second [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). This gave Fortier the choice of Collective Restraint, [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch), [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). The Therapy and Witness were sent to the bin.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptval07/qf3_fortier.jpg)*Fortier made a 2-0 run…*Rus went for an [Indrik Stomphowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indrik+Stomphowler), I'm guessing with the aim of taking out Fortier's Divining Top with his Deed in response to the Fortier trying to save it. There was no need for any of that nonsense as Fortier was on hand with Venser. Even with the security blanket of the Deed Rus had to be a little careful. The motley Wizard beats had dropped him to a fragile 3 life. In his turn he floated white mana with the [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and then flashed back [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) (naming [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)) to clear the way. He went for the risky play of a big Dragon: [Teneb, the Harvester](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teneb%2C+the+Harvester).


It was ultimately too risky. A spin of the top found another [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), and one attack step later Fortier was now just a single game away from the Semifinals.


Fortier 2, Rus 0


### Game 3


Rus got one of those Rock starts that just shreds the opponent's hand with pinpoint discard. [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) hit [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), Therapy took out [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). Rus wasn't done there, either. He fetched back Therapy with an [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) and ripped out a Venser and [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) for good measure.


Amazingly, Fortier still had game after all this. He managed to get [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) into play and then retrieved the earlier discarded Top with [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins) to set up the mini-combo.


It still wasn't good for the Frenchman. Rus had a Deed out and was bashing his face in with [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch). Fortier managed to counter the second Hierarch with a second elephant of his own sitting on top of his library. His Hierarch came in to bring him back up to a healthier 5 life. His board position didn't look so bad either. He had [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance), Top, [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), and his own Hierarch.


It was only an illusionary advantage though. Rus still had the [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), and he decided this was the best time to let both players start again, especially when he followed with [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) fetching back a [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch).


Fortier still had the Top, though. This found him a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and that was enough to hold off Rus's forces. A Jitte threatened to give him a little wiggle room, only for another Deed to rub out everything with converted mana cost of two or lower.


Rus hadn't quite won yet. [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) took down the Elephant as the Witness knocked Fortier down to 3 life, then 1.


Rus just couldn't put Fortier away. [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) for three took down the Witness. Then [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) fetched more Explosives.


Could Fortier come back and take the game and match? Rus seemed unhappy with his draws and Fortier still had a Top to dig for answers, although his single point of life meant he wouldn't be able to use sac lands to flush away any rubbish from the top of his library. Having access to all five colors of mana proved to be useful for Fortier as even an [Indrik Stomphowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indrik+Stomphowler) wasn't big enough to get out of range of his Explosives.


Then Rus found [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). Surely this would put the game away?


Teneb, [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis), and [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish). How would you like to die?


Slowly, as it happened. Very slowly. Fortier tried to cling on in face of inevitability, but eventually [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) thudded through.


Fortier 2, Rus 1


Fortier had to mulligan for the fourth game and immediately found himself another card down as [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) connected with the [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) he had in hand.


Nothing much exciting happened in the first few turns. Fortier had a Jitte, but no one around to carry it. He used up Explosives just to kill Rus's [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). That felt a little wasteful.


The action cranked up a notch afterwards. Rus commenced beating with a 4/4 [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch), while Fortier found a [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) to carry the Jitte. Rus tried to foil any attempts to accumulate counters on the Jitte with the old classic of [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). Fortier wasn't going to let this happen as he [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy)'d the annoying Snake Shaman out of the way.


[Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) looked ominous again, netting Rus Deed and [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) and putting [Teneb, the Harvester](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teneb%2C+the+Harvester) and a Stomphowler in the graveyard. The Deed took out both [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and Jitte, while Rus's Elephant was free to continue molesting Fortier's life total.


A [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) arrived to tower over Rus's Hierarch as Fortier again showed he wasn't about to lie down that easily. Unfortunately for him, a [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) meant the [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) wasn't going to hang around long, and that left the way clear for Rus to crash through with a multiple assortment of Elephants, Beasts, and Incarnations.


After a little under two hours playing time, Rus had finally pulled the match back to all square.


Fortier 2, Rus 2


There was no explosive start for Fortier in the decider, and Rus again fired off a [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) in search of [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). It missed but quickly came back to take out a lone [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptval07/qf3_rus.jpg)*Rus countered with a 2-0 of his own…*Lacking artifacts, Fortier was forced to throw both a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) to [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). The second Tarmogyf appeared and was joined by a Top-fetching [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). The 'Goyf hadn't quite grown up yet, though, and Rus was still free to get some swings in with a [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch). He brought a second to the party, sniffing a place in the Semifinals.


When both Elephants charged in Fortier gave Rus something to think about as he threw all of his men—Dark confidant, [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage)—in the way of one of them.


"[Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge)?" Rus asked, fearing an instant artifact discard to grow the 'Goyf.


The Slovenian played it safe and killed the Confidant and [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). He added [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) to the beats...


...only to see his fatties blown to bits by a pinpoint [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives).


Now Fortier could take the offensive with his [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). His advantage didn't last too long, though, as [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) put [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) and a Witness in the graveyard and gave Rus [Indrik Stomphowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indrik+Stomphowler) and Teneb. Fortier simply added a second [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), trying to overpower the Slovenian player before the card advantage from the [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) began to bite.


Rus finally sac'ed the Elder to fetch the sixth land he needed for Teneb. He went for the big dragon.


Fortier spun his Top...


... and found a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)!


What a heartbreaker for Rus. The Slovenian player visibly slumped in his chair.


Both [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s crashed in for 8 damage. It looked very grim indeed for Rus's tournament survival. He thought in his upkeep for a while before digging back Teneb with [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis). Fortunately he'd drawn the land he needed and was able to make two [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s as chump blockers.


Fortier played a [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) and spun the top so he'd be able to draw and discard it to Thirst. That found him a [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant).


It was another tough upkeep call for Rus. He chose not to use [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) this time. He [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy)'d one [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and then played [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) with the aim of repeating the process on the other 'Goyf.


And was thwarted by another [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).


[Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) crashed in. The game was balanced on a knife-edge. Fortier was at 4 life, Rus 3.


The Slovenian player went for the big Dragon again. If it stuck he would win, if it didn't, well...


No [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) this time, but there were any number of cards that would end it. All Fortier needed to do was find a way to remove the dragon. He dug deep with [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge).


Then it was upkeep and time to ask Bob. Fortier needed a Venser, but if Bob flipped it over that would be game to Rus right there as Fortier was only on 4 life.


And the top card was...


...[Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy)!


Fortier went down to 1 life but it didn't matter. [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) was enough to take down the dragon and clear the way for [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to take the game and match.


A thriller.


Fortier 3, Rus 2
