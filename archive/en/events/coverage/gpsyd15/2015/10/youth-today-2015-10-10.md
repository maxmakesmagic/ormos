Eleven or twelve years ago, most of us were playing *Mirrodin* and *Champions of Kamigawa*. Hamish Seymour (12) and Kade Silverthorne (11) were literally just born, so you'll have to forgive them for maybe not having the same level of knowledge on the Brothers War, or the crew of the Weatherlight as you or I might.


(Don't look at me like that, [Sisay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sisay) was an interesting and conflicted character.)


Quite possibly the youngest players at the event this weekend, Hamish and Kade have been friends for a long time, and are home-schooled together.



 "A friends of ours, James, he introduced us to *Magic* a couple of years ago. We played a couple of games, and we were hooked," Hamish grinned.



"Yeah, we play on Wednesday afternoons as part of home-school," explained Kade, who despite towering over Hamish, is a year younger than his friend.



 That's funny, I think most of us found *Magic* while *avoiding* class, not attending it. Oh to be young again.
