This week's "Sketches" takes a look at the illustration of [Totem Speaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Totem+Speaker) from *Legions*. Darrell Riche was the man at the helm for the project.

### 1. Art Description

These were the instructions given to the artist:

 "Location: The Wirewood Forest  
 Action: Show an elf emerging from the forest alongside a couple of mammal-like, fantasy forest beasts. They are clearly traveling together.  
 Notes: the elf is a cleric and so should be carring a staff and no weapons."

### 2. Sketches

Here is Darrell's original sketch. The two creatures shown alongside the Elf Druid are odd critters -- beasts, but not quite *Legions* beasts.

First, the art team wanted to see bonespurs -- thick spikes made of bone -- coming out of the Speaker's companions, since they had to be recognizably beasts for the art to make sense; see also [Enormous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enormous+Baloth) and [Feral Throwback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Throwback). Second, they wanted the elf himself to correspond to the *Legions* look for elves -- see also [Wirewood Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler) and [Elvish Soultiller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Soultiller). That meant a change to his chin (spikier) and hair (made of vines), and to be sure his skin ended up greenish, since by *Legions*, elves had acquired many characteristics of their buddies, the trees. 

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The elf's look is much more in line with other elves in the set, and his creature friends have acquired some token bone spurs.

### 4. Card

And finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
