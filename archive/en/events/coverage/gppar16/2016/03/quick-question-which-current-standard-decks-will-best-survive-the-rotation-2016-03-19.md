While players were battling through Standard in Paris, we decided to take a look into the near future of the format. What decks might survive the upcoming rotation relatively intact? Here's what some of the pro players in attendance this weekend had to say.

**Gold-level pro Christian Calcano:** Red-Green Ramp. Its biggest loss is [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon), but you still have [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller). And even though [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) rotates out, I think you could still play an Aristocrats-style deck with [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company). It won't be as powerful as Four-Color Rally, but it may still be viable.

**No. 16 Joel Larsson:** Most decks get huge dinks in their mana bases, but Red-Green Ramp survives almost completely. [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) rotates out, but if the next format doesn't become too planeswalker-heavy, then Ugin can be replaced by, say, [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return).

**Magic Online Champion Magnus Lantto:** Red-Green Ramp seems to stay almost intact in full. And there are so many good red and black cards that Black-Red Dragons, or Black-Red Control, may survive as well. But the new Shadows over Innistrad cards are going to be so powerful that I think it's going to be more about the new decks.

**Hall of Famer Ben Stark:** Esper Dragons because [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai), [Silumgar's Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Scorn), and all other Dragon cards remain legal. The mana is going to get a lot worse, though. Red-Green Ramp with [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) also stays.

**No. 10 Fabrizio Anteri:** Bant Company comes to mind. [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) can still form the core of a deck after the rotation.

**Hall of Famer Gabriel Nassif:** Maybe Red-Green Eldrazi with [Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage) as a great ramp spell. And [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) is a really powerful card, so I think the shell of some red midrange deck may stick around as well.

**Two-time Pro Tour semifinalist Patrick Dickmann:** Red/Black Dragons only loses [Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury). It still has [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) and [Draconic Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draconic+Roar) and all the other good cards. There's also always going to be a red deck, possibly less aggressive but maybe still with green. [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) and [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) might make for a blue-red control deck, though it will clearly be harder, though not impossible, to get [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) for 3.

**Gold-level pro Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** Ramp decks will survive the rotation. Something red, of course, but it won't be anything like the current day's Atarka Red. And I think you might still be able make the mana work for Esper Dragons. Obviously not with four copies of [Grasp of Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness) and four copies of [Silumgar's Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Scorn). But I mean, the deck existed with just fetch lands and no battle lands, so there's no real reason why it shouldn't be able to work off just battle lands, no fetch lands.

**No. 18 Martin Dang:** Jace already was the best card in the format. Now it may be even better thanks to madness. Jace decks will definitely be tier one.
