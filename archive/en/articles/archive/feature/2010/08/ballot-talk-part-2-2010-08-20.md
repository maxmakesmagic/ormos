We're down to just one week left in the balloting for the [2010 Pro Tour Hall of Fame](/en/node/574031). While the remaining voters stew over the tough choices facing them on how to cast their five votes, the number of voters and interested members of the **Magic** community sharing their ballots continues to grow. Thanks to the wonders of Twitter and Facebook, it's never been easier to share your picks, debate the merits of players, and stump for who you think deserves **Magic** immortality.

If you need a refresher to see who's on the ballot, take a gander [over here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2010-07-29-0) and then come back for some heady analysis and opinion.


Ready? Here we go.


[Chris McNutt at thestarkingtonpost.com](http://www.thestarkingtonpost.com/articles/-/A_Critical_Numerical_Look_at_the_Hall_of_Fame_Nominees) took a serious look at the statistics, as well as devising some of his own, in a search to quantify the Hall of Fame's voting criteria of a "player's performances, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, and contributions to the game in general." Along with his analysis, he includes polls to get readers' opinions on which elements of that statement should be weighed heavier than others.


Pro Tour superstar Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, who happens to be eligible for Hall consideration starting in 2012, begins [his column at channelfireball.com](http://www.channelfireball.com/home/pvs-playhouse-my-hall-of-fame-ballot/) about the Hall with this statement:



> "To me, the Hall of Fame should have about five people â€“ Budde, Finkel, Kenji, Zvi and Nassif. "

He then goes on to admit that this isn't an opinion shared by most of the community, and delves deep into the resumes of the five players receiving his consideration.


Back on the starkingtonpost.com, Antonino de Rosa (who became eligible for the Hall last year) [offered up an honest critique](http://www.thestarkingtonpost.com/articles/-/Changing_the_Hall_of_Fame) of the Hall's voting system, as well as proposing an expansion of categories to the Hall to expand it beyond Pro players.


Longtime writer [Adrian Sullivan stepped over to the Select side of the offerings at starcitygames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/misc/19873_Feature_Article_My_Hall_of_Fame_Ballot.html) to share his ballot. 


Over at mananation.com, [Trick Jarrett admitted to being surprised](http://www.mananation.com/tricks-2010-hall-fame-ballot/) at how hard it was to narrow the list of 73 candidates to five votes. 



> "I'm not joking when I say that my ballot underwent some drastic changes in the last few days as I changed my perspective and opinions. Moving names on and off the list in a myriad of variations, I am finally happy with my ballot."

And that's just a smattering of the ballots that have been made public. Voting closes on August 27, with the inductees being announced September 5 during the Pro Tour-Amsterdam webcast. The inductees will be ushered into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame during the opening ceremony at this year's Worlds in Chiba.
