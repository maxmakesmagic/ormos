*Alliances* uncommon. Congratulations to **furrymonster** for being the first to officially guess last week's Card of the Day cycle! All of last week’s cards have another printed version with a different mana cost, though not necessarily a misprint. (Several of these were misprints from the *Anthologies* boxed set, which isn’t in Gatherer.) Thanks also to **Gradient** for telling an involved story about Fireball, even if it was *really* about Gnomes.
