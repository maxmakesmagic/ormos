Graybeard Tsuyoshi Ikeda has been on an upswing lately, much thanks to his compatriots on Team Fireball. This weekend, he and his crew are running blue-black Zombie-Bidding. This round he faces off against Fumihiko Sano, playing an unconventional take on mono-white control that splashes blue for [Complicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complicate) and [Chain of Vapor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor).

### Game 1

![Twisted Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Twisted+Abomination)Ikeda led with [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin), and swampcycled his [Twisted Abomination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Abomination). Sano steadied the ground with [Silver Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight) and then dug out a plains with [Eternal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon). Ikeda tried a morph, but that was outclassed by [Dawn Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Elemental). Ikeda held his ground and took three in the air. He pitched [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul) to turn up [Putrid Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Raptor) and cycled a [Gempalm Polluter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Polluter), readying [Patriarch's Bidding](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Bidding).He didn't blow it right away, though. He punched through for four with his Raptor and then summoned a second Goblin and a [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator), trying to bait out the Vengeance. Sano didn't bite. They stared at each other. Sano cycled another [Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon), picked it up, and was done.

Ikeda decided it was time. [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes) for Five stocked his 'yard, with two [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin)s giving him cards while taking out the [Silver Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight). He hit for damage and played the Bidding. He board was impressive to say the least. Sano drew his card, and then packed it all up.

Ikeda 1 – Sano 0

### Game 2

Sano started Game 2 with a much more threatening [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight). Its buddy the [Silver Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight) followed while Ikeda just cycled [Twisted Abomination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Abomination). He played a morph on turn three and gave it back to Sano. [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight) swung in, and forced a discard of [Vengeful Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dead) to the [Putrid Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Raptor). Sano added [Dawn Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Elemental) to his team. Ikeda needed something, in a hurry.

![Dawn Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dawn+Elemental)Sano pounded for five. Ikeda cycled another Abomination. [Head Games](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Head+Games) wasn't much help, considering the pressure he was under. He [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes) for four, and turned up more blanks. He'd need to hit it again. Another five left him at three. He Read for five. No [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul) came. He played [Head Games](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Head+Games) to get a look at Sano's deck, and then scooped.Ikeda 1 – Sano 1

### Game 3

Sano's back-to-back [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight)s threatened to make things tough on Ikeda. He had a plan, though, and it involved his sideboarded [Decree of Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Pain). When Sano missed his fourth land play with just two plains and a [Temple of the False God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+the+False+God) in play, Ikeda's hopes rose with the thought of a quick Bidding. Two [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes) later, though, he was still Bidding-less. He cycled Decree to get rid of the dudes, but Sano just replaced them with a morph, thanks to his fourth land.

Again, Ikeda drew no Bidding. He was forced to play a morph of his own. Sure enough Sano was due for a fifth land, enabling him to flip up his Angel. [Complicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complicate) stopped the second Angel, but Ikeda needed an answer to the first. He cycled feverishly, but no Bidding came.

**Final Result:** Fumihiko Sano defeats Tsuyoshi Ikeda 2-1
