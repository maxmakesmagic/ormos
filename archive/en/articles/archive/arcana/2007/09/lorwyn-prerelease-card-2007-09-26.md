The countdown to [the release](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases) of *Lorwyn* in your favorite local game store, October 12th, is on. You can get an early taste of the set *this* weekend at [select locations](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases-lor) at the prerelease—and you’re in for a lupine treat. You may have seen this card in yesterday’s Serious Fun preview article by the Ferrett, but you’ve never seen it like this. You can get one of these when you show up at the prerelease, while supplies last:
