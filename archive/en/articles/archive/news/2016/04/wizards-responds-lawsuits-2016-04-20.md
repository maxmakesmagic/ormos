**Renton, WA**—A handful of individuals who have been *Magic* judges for many years recently brought two lawsuits against Wizards of the Coast alleging that participating in the *Magic* community as a judge equates to employment with Wizards. These lawsuits are meritless.


With the exception of the Pro Tour, the World *Magic* Cup, and the *Magic* World Championship, *Magic* events are run by tournament organizers and local game stores who directly engage judges. But these lawsuits claim that Wizards runs *all* events and that the people judging those events are Wizards employees. Anyone who has played at their local store knows this simply is not true.


*Magic: The Gathering* is fortunate to have the greatest community in gaming. Fans choose to become judges out of a sincere love of the game and as a way to enjoy their favorite hobby. They ensure events are fair and fun, and we appreciate everything they do.


We look forward to quickly resolving the matter. While we defend against these spurious lawsuits, we want to assure the *Magic* community that we will do everything possible to ensure that premier events continue to run smoothly. We thank the entire *Magic* community—players, organizers, and judges—for their continued support.
