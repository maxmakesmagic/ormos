Sometimes we like to show a piece of art from the new set and follow the art's evolution all the way from the original art description through one or more sketches from the artist to the final art on the **Magic** card. Other times, we like to just put a handful of pieces up and let you go back and forth between the sketch and the final version. This is that second kind of time!

Mouse over each image to see the final version. If you move your mose back and forth really quickly, it's like you're caught between the past and the present! Or, since these cards are reprints, it's like you're caught between the past and another, less recent, past!
