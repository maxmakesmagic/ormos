*Masters 25* Arrives Tomorrow
-----------------------------


This Wednesday, March 14, *Masters 25* comes to *Magic Online*! (It will be available after the morning's downtime. This is earlier than we announced previously; see Aaron Forsythe's article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/dominaria-previews-and-moving-forward-2018-03-12) for further explanation.) Draft from a selection of cards representing every tournament-legal *Magic* set ever printed, then show off the epic synergies you put together. The possible archetypes are practically endless, and there's no shortage of power available.


Commons from *Masters 25* will be Pauper-legal as of the March 14 downtime, and the latest Treasure Chest updates will also take effect at that time. To see the full schedule of *Masters 25* events and get the details of the Treasure Chest updates, check out Alli Medwin's article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/masters-25-plus-treasure-chest-updates-2018-03-06).


 
Last Chance for Legacy Cube
---------------------------


Well, for now, at least. This run of the Legacy Cube lasts until this Friday, March 16, at 10 a.m. PT. That means you've still got time to jam a few more drafts—and if you haven't tried it out yet, you've still got a chance!


For full details on the Legacy Cube events, check out the [February 27 blog post](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-february-27-2018). To see the full Cube card list, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/legacy-cube-cardlist).


 
Streamer Showdown Thursday
--------------------------


Streamer Showdown is back this Thursday, March 15, at 1 p.m. PT. And this time, the streamers will be drafting *Masters 25*! Get your very first look at how the set plays out, and see what cards your favorite streamers gravitate toward. You might get to hear some nostalgic stories about cards that were significant to them in the past; you will definitely get to see some wild, creative synergies between old cards and new.


If you've never watched one before, Streamer Showdowns are eight-player events featuring talented streamers from all across the *Magic* community. Usually, there are two pods (one at 1 p.m., the other at 5 p.m.), but there will only be a 1 p.m. pod this week. Check out the roster of streamers below:

Team Modern Super League Tonight *and* Tomorrow
-----------------------------------------------


Since last week's Team Modern Super League episode was postponed, this week brings two episodes to make up for it: one tonight, at the usual time, and another tomorrow, also at 5 p.m. PT. Modern is already a deep format with a huge diversity of viable deck options, and the inventive team-based deck rules used by TMSL makes things even less predictable.


TMSL airs Tuesdays (like this one!) at 5 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about Team Modern Super League [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/tmsl-info/), or check out the video below.

Top finishers qualify for the Playoff Event on May 5 (the format for which will be Modern).


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the year. Top players on the [Leaderboard](http://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) at the end of the 2018 MOCS will qualify for the year-end Championship.


 
PTQ Finals Event This Sunday
----------------------------


A Pro Tour Qualifier Finals Event will kick off this Sunday, March 18, at 7 a.m. The format will be *Rivals of Ixalan-Ixalan* Sealed. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required to join this event, and the winner will qualify for Pro Tour *Dominaria*.
