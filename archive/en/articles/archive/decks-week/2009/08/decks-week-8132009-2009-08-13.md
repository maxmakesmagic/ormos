M***agic** 2010* is now available on **Magic Online**, and the Draft and Sealed queues have been firing like crazy! With players headed to the Release Events instead of Premier Events, we have fewer digital lists for you but to make up for it we've got Grand Prix–Brighton *and* the latest from the Pro Tour Qualifier scene for Austin! Plenty of action to get creative minds cooking over what the next big tech in the worlds of Standard, *Shards of Alara* Block, and everything else will be!


Enjoy!
