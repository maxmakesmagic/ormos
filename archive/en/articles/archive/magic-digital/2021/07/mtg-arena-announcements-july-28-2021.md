Have some dream decks you want to try out? This is a great time to do it! Cards not in your collection are only available during this event and are not added to your collection.


[Midweek *Magic* events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-02#midweekmagic) run weekly from Tuesday at 8 a.m. PT through Thursday at 8 a.m. PT with a different format each week.
