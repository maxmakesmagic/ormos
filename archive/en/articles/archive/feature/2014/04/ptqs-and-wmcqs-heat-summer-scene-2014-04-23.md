If you're looking to take the step up to more competitive **Magic** tournaments, this summer offers two paths to take to the premier-play level. Not only is the next season of Pro Tour Qualifiers starting up in June, but World **Magic** Cup Qualifiers are coming in August. 

 Store-run Pro Tour Qualifiers for Pro Tour "Huey" start June 7 and run until August 24. The format is Modern. The winner of each store-run qualifier will receive an invitation and travel award to Pro Tour "Huey" and a bonus of 1,000 Planeswalker Points. The Top 8 playoff participants receive an exclusive Pro Tour Qualifier Top 8 playmat.

 Pro Tour "Huey" will take place October 10–12 in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. "Huey" is the project codename for the set, with the official name to be revealed Sunday, May 18, during the live Top 8 webcast of Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*. 

 You can read complete information about store-run PTQs [here](/en/node/640206). A schedule of store-run PTQs can be found [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/qualifierlist). Information about **Magic Online** Pro Tour Qualifiers will be announced at a later date. 

 World **Magic** Cup Qualifiers will be held on three weekends in late summer: August 16–17, August 30–31, and September 13–14. There are no Grand Prix being run on any of those weekends, so players around the world won't have to choose between playing in a WMCQ or a Grand Prix. Wizards of the Coast is excited to announce that a record 72 countries will run World **Magic** Cup Qualifiers: 

 Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, England, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Panama, Paraguay (added for 2014), Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation, Scotland, Serbia, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, Wales
