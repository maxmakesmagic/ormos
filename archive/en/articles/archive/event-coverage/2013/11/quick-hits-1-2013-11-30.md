**Which card in Theros Sealed has changed the most in value for you since the set was released?**

No. 25 Ranked Player Jon Stern — *“I thought [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) was a premium uncommon when the set was first released. But now, I know that it doesn't kill what you need to kill. I also initially thought [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) was very good, but now I think it is even better.“*

Grand Prix Portland Finalist Joe Demestrio —  *“[Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon). I always thought it was okay, but now I think it may be in the top 5 commons of the set for Sealed.”*

Two-Time Grand Prix Champion Seth Manfield — *“Probably [Sedge Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Scorpion).”*

No. 12 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald —  *“[Dragon's Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Mantle). I thought it was medium, but it's actually quite good.”*

No. 12 Ranked Player Alexander Hayne — *“[Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form). At the start of a format, cards like that seem only like card disadvantage, but it turns out the format is more about building up a big guy and cards like that are key for breaking through.”*

No. 3 Ranked Player Reid Duke —  *“[Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn). It didn't really stand out to me at first, but I think both the ramping effect and the color fixing have both impressed me.”*
