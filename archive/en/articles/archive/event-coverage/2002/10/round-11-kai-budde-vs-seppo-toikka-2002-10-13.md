![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop02/a904.jpg)Both of these players are 8-2 coming into the round, but Seppo certainly wasn't confident of his chances. Kai has an amazing red-blue deck with [Rorix Bladewing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing), [Arcanis the Omnipotent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent), and [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat) to name a few. The Finnish player is White-Blue, but at least he does have [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance), the new [Nevinyrral's Disk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk).

### Game 1

Seppo went first and made a [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier) on his third turn. Kai made a Morph and so did Toikka as he missed the fourth land drop. Budde played a [Goblin Sharpshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter), and chose not to block when Seppo attacked, since he wanted to get maximum usage out of the Goblin.

Kai made a Morph guy and attacked, Seppo decided not to block. The German then revealed his Morph to be [Riptide Entrancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Entrancer) allowing him to steal Seppo's Morph, and also use his Sharpshooter to kill the Gustcloak Harier. Toikka kept it alive with a [Piety Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm).

However, Seppo had still not managed to find a fourth land, and had to sit idly by as Kai drew and cast his [Rorix Bladewing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing). This must rapidly be becoming one of Kai's favorite cards since he had one in his sealed deck yesterday. With no answer for the dragon, Toikka scooped

Kai Budde 1 – Seppo Toikka 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop02/a905.jpg)Seppo went first, and summoned a [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) on turn three as he had just drawn it. Kai had a Sharpshooter again along with a Morph. The Morph blocked [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker), allowing Kai to shoot. Seppo made a [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier) and a [Mistform Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Wall) while Budde did nothing.

After they had attacked once, Kai got to six mana and dropped [Arcanis the Omnipotent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent), radfically altering the outlook of the game. Budde then used [Ixidor's Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ixidor%27s+Will) to counter [Aven Fateshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fateshaper), drawing a comment about how playable the card was from Seppo. The Harrier continued to attack in the air until Kai put [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill) on his Arcanis.

By this time Kai had drawn [Slipstream Eel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slipstream+Eel) and [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat) and although Seppo used [Dispersing Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispersing+Orb) to deal with Arcanis, he had no way of stopping the others.

**Final Result:** Kai Budde 2 – Seppo Toikka 0

After the match, Kai admitted that it was the first time he had drafted this format, although he was very unlucky not to go 3-0
