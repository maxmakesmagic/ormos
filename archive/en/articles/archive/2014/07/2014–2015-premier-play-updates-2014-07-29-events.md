The 2013–2014 *Magic* Premier Play season has seen an exciting level of participation. This season has seen two of our largest Grand Prix ever: Grand Prix Las Vegas 2013, with 4,500 players, and Grand Prix Richmond 2014, with 4,300 players. We've also seen participation at the PTQ and store-level events go up in all regions. The participation from players has remained constant this season.



As we're about to head into the final Pro Tour of the season—a new addition to the 2013-2014 professional season—and after collecting feedback from players, judges, organizers, and stores the past year, we're excited to announce some changes to Pro Tour Qualifiers, Grand Prix, and Pro Points.



We have broken down these announcements into three separate articles, which you can find below.



[The New Path to the Pro Tour](/node/255201)



[Improving the Grand Prix](/node/255216)



[New Enhancements to the Pro Players Club Starting August 2014](/node/255226)



We are confident these changes will improve *Magic* Premier Play on a global scale and reward our loyal players.



We are always listening to feedback from the community, and it is thanks to that feedback that we are able to make adjustments and improvements to our programs. Thanks again for all of your support.
