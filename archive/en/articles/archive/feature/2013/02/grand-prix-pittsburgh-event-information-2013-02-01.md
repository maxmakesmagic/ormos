The number of rounds on Day 1 will be determined based on the number of players registered, Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event.
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff round.

* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* When necessary, standings as of the final Swiss round will be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

(For Grand Prix Pittsburgh, the cutoff date will be March 20.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:

### Sleep-In Special

 Have some byes and don't want to get up to register your deck at 9 a.m.? Here's a deal for you! If you have byes and register any time before Friday at 10 p.m., you are eligible for the "Sleep-In Special." Unfortunately, players with byes who register on Saturday are not eligible for the Sleep in Special.   
  
 You may ONLY skip the player meeting and deck registration/construction if you paid for the Sleep-In Special.   
  
 Cost: $20 USD (regardless of number of byes) 


**How the Sleep-In Special works** Once you have paid for the Sleep-In Special, a sealed deck card pool will be registered and verified on your behalf. Instead of arriving at 9 a.m. for the player meeting, you will check in prior to your first round of play (based on your number of byes) and receive a preregistered pool. Preregistered decks are chosen at random for each Sleep-In Special from the selection of preregistered decks. From the time when you get the pool, you will have 30 minutes to construct your deck and turn in your decklist. You begin play for the proper round after your byes and continue as normal.   
  
 You will need to report a minimum of 30 minutes PRIOR to the start of your first round of play. The estimated round start times for Saturday are: 

* Round 1: 10 a.m.
* Round 2: 11 a.m.
* Round 3: 12 p.m.

 Check the Professional Event Services [Grand Prix Pittsburgh website](http://www.professional-events.com/Magic/GrandPrix/Pittsburgh2013/) for more details about the Sleep in Special and how to register for the Sleep in Special if you can't make it on-site until Saturday.
