As I explained in my last post, no power/toughness/mana cost combination can win unless it had at least one third of the vote. As no one option achieved this level, we will have a run-off between the top three vote getters. From small to large (we don’t want to falsely influence anyone) they are:

The remaining power/toughness/mana cost combinations fell as such:
