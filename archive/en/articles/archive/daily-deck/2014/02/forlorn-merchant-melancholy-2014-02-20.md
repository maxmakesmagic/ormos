Forlorn Merchant of Melancholy
==============================



 Posted in **Daily Deck**
 on February 21, 2014 










 Black is my favorite color in **Magic**, and although I'm not a big fan of Zombies, I do like the Returned of *Theros*. Those gold masks look really cool, and the Returned have a sort of melancholy about them that Kelly Digges explored in his story, "[Asphodel](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/277)." Trick has looked at the Returned a couple times (in "[Intrusion](https://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1358)" and "[The Returned](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1379)") so let's do it again, this time with one from *Theros* and one from *Born of the Gods*! 

Gray Merchant of Asphodel
"Gary" (as it's affectionately known) is popular in both Limited and Standard, so it seemed like a good place to start. It's a little hard to see at card size, but there is a trail of gold coins dropping out of the gray merchant's bag, as instructed in the art direction:


> Maybe a sack has fallen off his back and split open, and coins spill out onto the ground. A trail of lost coins, which has fallen out of one of his sacks, can be seen on the road behind him.
>

Take a look:

Forlorn Pseudamma
 Moving on to *Born of the Gods*, let's start with the art description: 


> Action: Deep within a cavern lit from some unknown source show a female Returned. She is a "pseudamma"—a Returned who steals the children of the living, eventually turning them into Returned as well.   
>  She is with two children, one holding each hand. They are roughly 4 to 6 years of age. The pseudamma has a signature golden mask of the Returned, but the two children forms don't have a golden mask yet—they are still living, but faceless.  
>  She should feel disconnected from the children and they from her, they simply blindly shamble where she leads.
> 
> 

Creepy.

 And, yes, there's a story that talks a bit about the pseudamma as well: Jennifer Clarke Wilkes's "[Dance of the Flitterstep](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/287)." Enjoy!
