It's Snow Week on **magicthegathering.com**. We've taken a look at snowy art of *Ice Age* ([Let it “Snow”](/en/articles/archive/let-it-snow-2003-12-17)) and pics of WotC's old building under a rare Seattle dusting of the [white stuff](/en/articles/archive/snow-covered-wotc-2004-01-08), but today it's a straight-up party in your optic nerve: it's all *Coldsnap* art, and lots of it.

*[Snow-Covered Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snow-Covered+Island) by Franz Vohwinkel*If you squint, you can see tiny figures that have made it to the top of the largest ice floe on Snow-Covered Island. There's also a bird or drake – there to guide them or eat them?

*[Frost Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Raptor) art by Lars Grant-West*The concept for this card was a flying, humanoid creature made of icy mist. But the creative team liked Lars's sketch of a raptor creature so much that it became [Frost Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Raptor).
