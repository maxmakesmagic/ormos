Also going on this weekend is [Grand Prix Miami](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-miami-2015), highlighting two days of Standard Constructed as the format continues to evolve and shift with each passing weekend. Miami has been the home of some excellent games of Standard in the past, and we'll see if familiar races—such as 2013 champion Reid Duke or finalist Brad Nelson—continue to build upon their already-incredible reputations.

And don't miss the post-Grand Prix excitement Tuesday evening with Week 6 of the [Vintage Super League](http://VintageSuperLeague.com/)!



After a tense match between [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) decks, Eric Froehlich remains the league's sole undefeated player. He will be paired up against Rich Shay this week, who's looking to improve on his 3-2 record in a fight for safer terrain going into the final three weeks of round-robin play. Meanwhile, a host of Hall of Famers and Pro Tour mainstays continue their fight to stay out of the dreaded last-place spot.



Week 6 is the final week of action with the current deck selections, and players will have the opportunity to change up their choices for the final three weeks of round-robin matches before the cut to the Top 4. Who will maintain their momentum? Join host Randy Buehler and the rest of the Vintage Super League competitors for the next episode. It all begins on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) Tuesday, March 10, at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. GMT.
