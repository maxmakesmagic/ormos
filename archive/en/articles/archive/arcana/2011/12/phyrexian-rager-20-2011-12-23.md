*We're taking a two-week holiday break and will be back with new stuff on Monday, January 2, 2012. Until then, please enjoy our favorite Arcanas of 2011. This article originally ran February 10, 2011.*


Hhere's the art description that was given to [Stephan Martiniere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Stephan+Martiniere%22%5D) for [Phyrexian Rager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager).

### Art Description


> 
> Color: Black creature

> 
> 
> Mood: It's fascinated by how you experience pain.
> 
>

Because the world had already seen a [Phyrexian Rager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager) in *Apocalypse*, there was an art reference for Stephan to work from. Here's what the original rager looked like.

### *Apocalypse*

### *Mirrodin Besieged*

Stephan's version focused more on the rager and didn't include a victim. It still seems pretty menacing, don't you think?
