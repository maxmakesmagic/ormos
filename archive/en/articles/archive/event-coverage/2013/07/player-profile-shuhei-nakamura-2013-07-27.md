### National Team Appearances: 2


Hall of Famer. Professional tourist. Unofficial Japanese ambassador.


There are many ways to describe Shuhei Nakamura, each applying equally well. One of the longest-tenured professional players, Nakamura has been not only playing **Magic** but traveling the world for **Magic** since the game was released in Japan.


As a true world traveler, it is always more of a surprise when Nakamura skips an event on the far side of the globe than shows up at one. It is not uncommon to see him participating in a Japanese Grand Prix one weekend, a North American one the next, and a European one the following week. All of this travel has brought Nakamura friends across the globe and made him one of the most recognizable players in the game.


What's even more insane than the sheer amount of traveling that Nakamura does for the game is the fact that he has been performing at the highest level without a drop-off for the entirety of his career. That's over a decade of consistency, and his recent Grand Prix performances prove that he shows no signs of letting up. The only thing that could prevent Nakamura from having a good year would be if he decided not to play anymore, which seems increasingly less likely with each passing year.


While other Japanese stars have risen over the past decade, they do so based on the foundation built by players like Shuhei Nakamura. Showing the Japanese community what the game can provide you and living a life of exploration, Nakamura has been one of the best ambassadors that **Magic** could ask for.
