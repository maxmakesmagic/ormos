The November 16, 2016 Update
============================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 16, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by your [No. 1 ranked player in the world](#8). Shota Yasooka. Or is it Seth Manfield? No, it's definitely Yasooka. This week anyway.


Today's Must
============


1. [Commander VS: Mono-Red!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34046_Commander-VS-.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

Well, now, that's a challenge. All four decks in today's Commander Vs. video are mono-red decks of different flavors: [Lovisa Coldeyes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes) vs. [Kurkesh, Onakke Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurkesh%2C+Onakke+Ancient) vs. [Jaya Ballard, Task Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaya+Ballard%2C+Task+Mage) vs. [Grenzo, Havoc Raiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Havoc+Raiser). Should be over pretty quick...


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [The Mental Performance](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-mental-performance/) | ChannelFireball | Will Jonathan

Jonathan's unofficial series on the mental aspects of performance while playing *Magic* continues. And not in the mind games sort of way—more in the visualize yourself being successful kind of way. If you mostly play at home with your friends, this article probably isn't for you. But if you find yourself getting the sweats when you're 5-1 at a Grand Prix only to finish 5-4, this might help you get over that hurdle.


1. [Rogue's Alley: Standard Seasons Past](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/kevincrimin-11162016-rogues-alley-standard-seasons-past/) | Gathering Magic | Kevin Crimin

Remember [Seasons Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past) and how it was everywhere in Standard for a while? Kevin Crimin does, and since it's still legal, he finds a shell for it in current Standard and goes to work.


1. [Brewing with Ghirapur Orrery](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34049_Brewing-With-Ghirapur-Orrery.html) | StarCityGames.com | Chris Lansdell

While we're talking about brewing, we might as well highlight another four-mana "what do we do with this?" artifact from *Kaladesh*. Ladsdell has some ideas about how to break the symmetry and use and abuse the [Ghirapur Orrery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Orrery).


1. [Stress Free Travel](http://www.constructedcriticism.com/standard/constructed-criticism-161-stress-free-travel/) | Constructed Criticism | Spencer Howland, Michael Minderaker, and Casey Bloodworth

The Constructed Criticism crew covers *Magic* trips over the years, though I hope they're not actually stories about stress-free travel, as that would be kind of unexciting. "Yeah, I made it to the airport early. Had a Cinnabon, and boarded with my group. Everything was as it should be..." doesn't make for a great story.


1. [Counterpunch](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/seanuy-11162016-counterpunch/) | Gathering Magic | Sean Uy

Today's puzzle is a head scratcher full of cards you might have never considered—and a win that will make your eyes bug out.


Just kidding about that last part. I have no idea what the solution is. This stuff is hard.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Magic Mics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | Reuben Bresler, Evan Erwin, and Erin Campbell

Wednesdays are Magic Mics nights, as the three-headed monster of *Magic* discussion tackle the topics of the week. Odds they talk Standard Showdown? Find out at 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. ET on [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics).


Top 25
======


1. Seth and Shota Swap Spots... Again

8th verse, same as the first. Another week, another swap between Seth Manfield, No. 1 last week, and Shota Yasooka, No. 1 this week (and also two weeks ago). But let's look at the big movers for this week, and hope that next week one of the two firmly establishes themselves as No. 1.


The biggest mover of an already ranked player is the four spots gained by Márcio Carvalho, who continues to impress in Limited where he and his teammates took first at the team Grand Prix last weekend, catapulting Carvalho into the Top 10 for the first time.


But the big winner is Alexander Hayne, back in the Top 25 after a prolonged absence. That means we lose Kentaro Yamamoto from the rankings as we make room for "Insane" Hayne.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [[Cardboard Crack] Four Color Factions](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5d90n1/cardboard_crack_four_color_factions/)

I'm linking to the Reddit thread, as that will also get you to the (very funny) comic, but the comic itself spawned a discussion about what to call the four-color factions. Most people call them "non-green" for WUBR and the like, but I rarely like defining something by what it isn't. That said, it's simple, clean, and accurate.


Or we could go with Moist Mardu and make everyone feel just a little bit icky.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Blue-Red Thermo Alchemist](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=109622)

This deck jumps in and out of being popular and effective, but Vinny Scibetta found a new angle on the deck that might just be good enough to take down a [Standard Showdown](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-showdown) event.


By combining the core of the deck—[Thermo-Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermo-Alchemist), [Stormchaser Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormchaser+Mage), [Fevered Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) and burn—with [Dynavolt Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower), Scibetta got to straddle the line between pure aggression and control. Against decks like White-Red Vehicles, he can use his spells to control the board. Against midrange strategies like Green-Black Delirium, those same spells can go to the face. And [Dynavolt Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower) can do both.


[Fevered Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) is always a strong choice whenever Green-Black midranged decks are all the rage, as they are now, so I wouldn't be shocked to see more people trying to give people the fever.
