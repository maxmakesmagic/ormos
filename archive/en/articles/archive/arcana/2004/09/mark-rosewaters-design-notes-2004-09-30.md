[![Mark Rosewater](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_markrosewater.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/authorarchive&author=MarkRosewater)M**agic** Head Designer [Mark Rosewater](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/authorarchive&author=MarkRosewater) doesn't wait to sit down at his desk at Wizards to start designing cards. He carries with him a piece of paper so he can jot down a **Magic** card or mechanic idea whenever it occurs to him. 

We thought it might be fun to show a fragment of some of Mark's design notes. Keep in mind that these pages are covered front and back with notes, and that Mark has *piles* of these stored away -- he's been jotting ideas this way since *before he was hired* at Wizards of the Coast! Here's a shot of one side of one of the pages, with some of the image blurred out (since some of the ideas haven't seen print yet!). 

  
*A sample of Mark Rosewater's design notes*


Here's a zoomed-in view of part of that page. See if you can identify the cards that grew out of these ideas! (This is a great demonstration of how long it takes some good ideas to make it onto cards: Mark estimates that this particular page was written in 1997, around the time of the design of *Tempest*.)
