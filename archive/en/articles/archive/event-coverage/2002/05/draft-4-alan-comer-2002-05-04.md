Alan sat down at table three knowing he had to go 3-0 to make top 8. Unlike some of his Godzilla teammates he was not actively forcing white this Pro Tour, but the opening booster really made him think hard.

### Set 1 (Actual picks boldfaced).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a775.jpg)Booster 1: [Hallowed Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer), [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm), [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), **[Master Apothecary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Apothecary)**, [Aven Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Archer).


"[Master Apothecary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Apothecary) is one of the few cards that will push me into white. It makes so many other bad white cards playable."


Booster 2: [Chlorophant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chlorophant), [Mystic Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Visionary), Chanflinger, **[Aven Windreader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Windreader)**, [Dreamwinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder).


Booster 3: **[Aven Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock)**, [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) (spent a while thinking about this one), [Centaur Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Garden), [Ember Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast), [Liquid Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquid+Fire), [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear).


Booster 4: [Deluge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deluge), [Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall), Nibbler, **[Mystic Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot)**.


Booster 5: [Peek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peek), **[Psionic Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift)**


Booster 6: [Phantom Whelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Whelp), **[Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer)**.


Booster 7: **Pilgrim Of Virtue**


Booster 8: **[Pilgrim of Virtue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilgrim+of+Virtue)**


Booster 9: [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), [Phantom Whelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Whelp), [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer), **[Aven Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Archer)**.


Alan also managed to pick up a [Mystic Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Visionary) before the cards ran dry in set 1.


I imagine Alan was feeling reasonably confident at this stage as he had picked up that 9th pick [Aven Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Archer), and had certainly established himself as the white mage.


Red/Blue, Black/Green, Alan (blue/white), Blue/Black, Green/Red. These were the colours of the players sitting around Alan. Not a white mage in sight, whilst blue his position on blue was not great, but was not awful.


During the review period after the first set of boosters Wolfgang Eder received a match loss for looking at Nicolai's cards repeatedly.


### Set 2


Booster 1: Braids, **Cephlaid Looter**, [Nomad Decoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy), [Shelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter), [Barbarian Lunatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic), [Psionic Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift). (Alan was hoping that the [Shelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) might make it round to him 9th pick.)


Booster 2: **[Kirtar's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Desire)**, [Embolden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden).


Booster 3: **[Hallowed Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer)**, [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt).


Booster 4: [Aven Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock), **[Lieutenant Kirtar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lieutenant+Kirtar)**.


Booster 5: [Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall), **[Mystic Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Crusader)**, [Phantom Whelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Whelp).


Booster 6: **[Aven Cloudchaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser)**, [Tattoo Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattoo+Ward).


Booster 7: **[Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall)**, [Testament of Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Testament+of+Faith).


Booster 8: [Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extract), **[Abandoned Outpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abandoned+Outpost)**.


Booster 9: **[Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall)**, [Soulcatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulcatcher).


Booster 10: **[Seafloor Debris](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seafloor+Debris)**.


There was nothing else of much relevance left in the remaining packs.


### Set 3 – *Torment*.


Booster 1: [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), **[Militant Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militant+Monk)**, [Strength of Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Isolation), [Liquify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquify), [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). He explained later that he thought that [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) was left quite late normally and he thought he might pick one up from the other packs.


Booster 2: [Strength of Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Isolation), **[Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher)**, [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). Later he told me that he just did not want to have to face the Butcher as he did not have a [Shelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) or anything like that. This was pretty much the first pick that I might have made differently - as he had a Looter and very little removal I might have taken the [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). He replied that he was not intending to splash a third colour in his deck due to the Apothecary – the sac. lands were to achieve threshold.


Booster 3: [Mystic Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Familiar), [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), **[Teroh's Faithful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teroh%27s+Faithful)**, [Liquify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquify).


Booster 4: **[Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper)**, [Churning Eddy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Churning+Eddy). For a long time he thought he was going to take the Eddy, but took the Temper in the end.


Booster 5: **[Floating Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floating+Shield)**.


Booster 6: **[Ghostly Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings)**.


Booster 7: **[Spirit Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Flare)** over [Coral Net](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Net).


Booster 8: **[Liquify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquify)**.


Booster 9: **[Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)**.


Unfortunately there was absolutely nothing left of value to Alan. This last set of boosters had been utterly savage to him and changed what looked like a 3-0 or 2-1 deck into one that might go as low as 1-2.
