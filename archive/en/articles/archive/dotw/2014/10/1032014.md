After a Prerelease weekend, as well as the big release weekend, it's time for see what aspiring Pro Tour players bring to their Pro Tour Qualifiers. While this PTQ season had a Limited warm-up featuring *Magic 2015*, the format has now shifted over to *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck with a Booster Draft Top 8.



As this weekend marks the first major move into the *Khans of Tarkir* Limited format, there are no decklists from events that feature the new cards in action just yet. Many who are competing in PTQs this weekend will be among the first to tackle the format. It's anyone's game, so be sure [to find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-fate-reforged-qualifiers) and see if you've got a chance to play in the new format this weekend!



And if not, never fear! We'll have some more *Khans of Tarkir* Limited decklists starting next week, but if you want to get your first glimpse at what the game's top strategies are in the new Limited format, you can tune in for live coverage of Grand Prix Orlando this weekend!



And as always, you can check out the latest tech from the new set in all formats starting today, as *Khans of Tarkir* Prereleases have begun on *Magic Online*. What sorts of new strategies will players be bringing to everything from Standard to the eternal formats? Be sure to check out the MTGO Decklists page below throughout the next week for the latest.
