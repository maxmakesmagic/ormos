This week's "Sketches" looks at *Legions* new Demon, [Havoc Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havoc+Demon) by Thomas Baxa. Thomas specializes in black cards.


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Color: black  
 Action: Show a demon flying at night."


Quite simple!


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Thomas.


The creative team was not thrilled with the idea of a composite piece (think senior picture), and asked Thomas to choose one or the otherâ€”the head shot or the body shot. The "X" shows the decision was made to just use the head shot.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
