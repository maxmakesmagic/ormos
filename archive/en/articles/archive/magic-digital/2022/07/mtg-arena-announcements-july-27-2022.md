Historic Anthology 6 and Explorer Anthology 1 Available Tomorrow
================================================================


Tomorrow, July 28, both Historic Anthology 6 and Explorer Anthology 1 hit the *MTG Arena* Store! If you haven't yet, [check out all the cards in Historic Anthology 6](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/bridge-your-way-new-historic-decks-historic-anthology-6-2022-07-27) and [Explorer Anthology 1](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/new-decks-and-new-play-options-explorer-anthology-1-2022-07-27). These anthologies open up new deck-building opportunities in both the Historic and the new Explorer formats by adding powerful, iconic, and popular cards from across *Magic*'s history.


These anthology bundles will be available only from July 28 until October 5, 2022, so grab yours today.


Arena Open This Weekend!
========================


[The Arena Open happens this weekend](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/july-2022-arena-open-alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate-limited-2022-07-20), July 30–31, with big prizes—up to $2,500 and Qualifier Weekend invitations—plus a new structure for Day 2 events. In past Limited Arena Open events, players who made it to Day 2 would draft a single deck and then play up to nine full matches with it. Although Day 2 is expected to be an intense competition, this many games with a single draft deck made the experience more of a repetitive grind.


To give Day 2 players more potential variety throughout the day, we are changing the structure of this month's Arena Open Day 2. Learn more in [the July 20 *MTG Arena* Announcements](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-announcements-july-20-2022#arenaopen) and on [The Arena Open page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/july-2022-arena-open-alchemy-horizons-baldurs-gate-limited-2022-07-20).


And don't forget, all participants will receive the Baldur's Gate Dragon sleeve!
