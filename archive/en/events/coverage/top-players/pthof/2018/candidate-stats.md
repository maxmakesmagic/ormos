2018 Candidate Statistics
=========================




Take a dive into the statistics of the 2018 *Magic*Pro Tour Hall of Fame candidates.






















2018 Candidate Stats
--------------------


The following is a breakdown of the candidates for induction in the 2018 *Magic* Pro Tour Hall of Fame. **All statistics are through August 5, 2018.**


*Editor’s Note (August 24, 2018): Top 16/32/64 counts have been updated for Justin Gary and Ken Yukuhiro since the original publication of these stats. The original stats had inadvertently left one Top 16 off Gary’s stats and included one too many for Yukuhiro. Additionally, the POY Top 10 total for Kentaro Yamamoto was adjusted from 4 to 0.*


Key
===


**MEDIAN:** Midpoint of career Pro Tour finishes (half above, half below)  
**3-Year Median:** Top median finish taken from three consecutive seasons (to qualify, must have played in a number of events in a three-year span equal to the total number of events minus three)  
**POY Top 10s:** Number of times a player finished in the Top 10 in a Player of the Year race.  
**Top Finishes:** These are cumulative counts by result finish (for example, a Top 8 finish is also counted as a Top 16, Top 32, and Top 64).  
**WC:** Appearance/Top 4 finishes at the current version of the *Magic* World Championship (2012-current, including the Players Championship)  
**Final Days:** The number of times a player has reached the Top 8 of a Pro Tour or old World Championship (1996-2011), the Top 4 of a team Pro Tour, and the Top 4 of a World Championship from 2012-present.
