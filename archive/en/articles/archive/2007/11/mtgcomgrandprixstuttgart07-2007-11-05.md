### Travel Information:


There are 2 Mercury hotels in walking distance of the venue and a Marriot further down the street.  

More hotels can be found in the center of Stuttgart.  

Book your hotel well in advance because these hotels will fill up fast.  
  
**HOW TO REACH**  
**TRAVEL BY CAR:**  

You need to take the Autobahn A81, which goes from the Swiss border in the south to Heilbronn in the north. You can reach it via the west (France) or via the east (Austria/Czech Republic) by taking the Autobahn A8 Karlsruhe-Munich) and leaving at Autobahn-Cross Stuttgart.  

From the north we advise you to take the Autobahn A5 Frankfurt-Karlsruhe, where you can switch to the A8. Leave the A81 at the descent “Sindelfingen Ost” which is only a few hundred meters from the tournament hall in Sindelfingen. It is signposted from there.  
  
**TRAVEL BY TRAIN:**  

Coming from the main station in Stuttgart, take the S1 to Böblingen/Sindelfingen. It leaves the station every 30 minutes. Get off of the S1 at the stop Goldberg (10 minutes walk to the tournament hall Sindelfingen) or at the stop Stuttgart-Vaihingen (and take the Bus 84 to the stop Messehalle every hour).  
  
**TRAVEL BY PLANE:**  

From the airport Stuttgart-Echterdingen take the train S2 or S3 to Stuttgart- Vaihingen. There take the bus 84 to Messehalle. You can find time tables for public transportation at [www.vvs.de](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=www.vvs.de) A list of nearby hotels can be found on this page: [www.sindelfingen.de](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=www.sindelfingen.de)  
  
**THE GP LOCATION**  

You can get a birds eye of things [here](http://www.goyellow.de/map/71065-sindelfingen/mahdentalstr.-114/)  
  

The exciting metropolis of Stuttgart is well known for its beautiful squares, palaces and buildings of different periods, architectural styles and cultural variety.  

High quality exhibitions, world-renowned opera, ballet and theatre draw millions of visitors to this city.  
  

The nearby town of Esslingen with it’s 1250 year old history and unique buildings from the Romanesque period, has with it’s fantastically preserved mediaeval town centre, the reputation of being the most beautiful in the mid-neckar region. The castle, with it’s splendid view of the Neckar river valley and the Filder plateau will make a lasting impression.  
  
**THINGS TO SEE/DO:**  

The Stuttgart Market Hall offers a wide and colorful range of International culinary specialties. If following the culinary path is your cup of thee (or should we say wine?) then a trip to the vineyards for a wine tasting has to be put on the schedule. In the wine museum in Uhlbach you can study the old craft of wine making and learn how to quaff a glass of wine in a little wine tasting session.  
  

If you like to learn more about Stuttgart guided city walking tours will take you through narrow alleys to numerous bourgeois and noble buildings in the city center. You can admire the architectural harmony of the Neues Schloss with Königsbeu, Altes Schloss with Schiller Square and the Stiftskirche church.  

 
* Don’t miss the post-modern New State Gallery, one of the cultural highlights of Stuttgart. Build by the English architect James Stirling. A guided tour of the State Gallery will be an unforgettable artistic experience.
* Stuttgart museums:
	+ The old and new States Gallery
	+ House of History of Baden-Württemberg
	+ Lindenmuseum
	+ Museum am Löwentor
	+ Natural history museum
	  
	+ And for those who like the current history more than long lost times there is:
	  
	+ The Porsche museum
	+ The new Mercedes world where you will be able to marvel at the history of the automobile.
	+ The Tram museum
