![Merfolk Seastalkers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Merfolk+Seastalkers)**[Merfolk Seastalkers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Seastalkers)** – *Zendikar* uncommon. The real reason [Merfolk Seastalkers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Seastalkers) doesn't tap flying creatures is due to concerns about balance and gameplay. But it's more fun to pretend it's because the merfolk are somehow creating a very localized [Flood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flood).
 ![51628](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=51628)**[Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=51628)** – *Fifth Dawn* uncommon. According to Aaron Forsythe (in an [article from 2004](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/witnessing-creation-2004-05-14-0)), [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) was created because green didn't have enough power in *Fifth Dawn*. And with a community rating of 4.822 (for the *Fifth Dawn* version), it's currently rated as highly as an *Unlimited* [Mox Pearl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=631). Mission accomplished!
 ![Zur the Enchanter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zur+the+Enchanter)**[Zur the Enchanter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur+the+Enchanter)** – *Coldsnap* rare. Because *Coldsnap* was a followup to *Ice Age* block (which was released ten years earlier, in 1995 and 1996), it was full of cards that called back to earlier times. [Zur the Enchanter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur+the+Enchanter), for example, was a character that appeared in [seven pieces of *Ice Age* flavor text](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&flavor=+%5Bzur%5D+%5Bthe%5D+%5Benchanter%5D&set=+%5B%22Ice+Age%22%5D).
 ![Bureaucracy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bureaucracy)**[Bureaucracy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bureaucracy)** – *Unglued* rare. Have you ever noticed that the art for [Bureaucracy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bureaucracy) is held on with "red tape"? How about the fact that the seal on the desk is a maze? Oh yeah? How about the way "Robert's Rules of Order" got changed to "Richard's" in honor of Richard Garfield? Also, the subsection 3.1(4) is probably a reference to pi.
 ![Moonmist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Moonmist)**[Moonmist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonmist)** – *Innistrad* common. The art of Moonmist shows off the apelike physique of Innistrad's werewolves: humanoid, with wolflike heads, hulking, powerful upper bodies, and smaller legs. You can read more about the look of *Innistrad* in [Jeremy Jarvis's article](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/159), and if you like Moonmist's art, you can [download it](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-moonmist-2011-09-02) as a wallpaper.
