 Making the Top 8 at a Pro Tour is a life changing experience. Most of these players have devoted a huge portion of their lives to the game. Today represents a culmination of a lifetime's work. *Magic* may be a personal endeavor during the tournament, but the process beforehand takes a village. Without any doubt, many of these players' closest relationships are a result of the game. I asked some of the Top 8 competitors' friends and peers if they wanted to say something about seeing these players in the Top 8.
