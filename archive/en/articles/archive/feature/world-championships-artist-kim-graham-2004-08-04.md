Kim Graham is a self-taught artist with a real passion for large dragons. As a staff sculptor for Wizards of the Coast, Kim created several memorable pieces, including a dragon with a 26-foot wingspan that now graces the entryway of their corporate headquarters. Kim won the 2002 Chesley Award for best three-dimensional work for the dragon she sculpted over the course of the convention, at the ConJose Art Show. Aside from dragons, her new passion is to revive Art Nouveau sculpture for architecture and for garden statuary.
