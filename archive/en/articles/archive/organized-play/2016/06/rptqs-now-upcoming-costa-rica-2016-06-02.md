Congratulations to everyone who earned their invitation to Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* in Sydney, Australia, last weekend!


Next Weekend's RPTQs
====================


There is still one more weekend of RPTQs for Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* coming up, as players across sixteen different cities (and *Magic Online*) will try their hand at *Shadows over Innistrad* Sealed to see if they can earn one of the coveted invitations to the Pro Tour. We'll of course bring you the results next week (just like last weekend's results have been posted today), so look for those!


While chances to qualify for Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* are drawing to a close, Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers (PPTQs) for Pro Tour *Kaladesh* are going on now! For more information on the current round that can start you down your path to the Pro Tour, check out the [Pro Tour *Kaladesh* PPTQs Fact Sheet](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/pptqhon16).


On the note of things drawing to a close, this really is the final weekend to qualify for Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*, because...


Grand Prix Costa Rica
=====================


[This weekend's Grand Prix](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpcos16), which takes place in San José, Costa Rica, marks the last Grand Prix to qualify players for the Pro Tour in Sydney. The Grand Prix main event is currently SOLD OUT, meaning no more registrations are taking place, and the field features a mixture of local players and *Magic* globetrotters coming to the event for some sun and a chance at Pro Points.


Marc Calderaro will be in Costa Rica providing the latest decklists, stories, and more for text coverage, so check back this weekend for the latest updates from San José!
