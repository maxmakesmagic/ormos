Here's a quick look at the most-played Legacy decks during the National Team rounds of Worlds competition. 


**Survival of the Fittest - 12**
  
 A green based deck that uses [Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest+)  to search out silver bullets as well as power out multiple [Vengevine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine)s in a single turn thanks to [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla).


**Merfolk - 8**
  
 The quartet of [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), [Merrow Reejerey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Reejerey), [Merfolk Sovereign](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Sovereign+)  and [Coralhelm Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coralhelm+Commander+)  backed by free counterspells like [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will+)  and [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze+)  are swinging games in its favor. 


**Tendrils Combo - 6**
  
 Cheap mana effects are plentiful in Legacy and when combined with the storm spell, [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), games could end in a single turn.


**Junk - 5**
  
 When you combine green, white and black into one deck, you get the best creatures like [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary+)  and [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), paired with the best removal in the form of [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares), [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate+)  and [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed).
