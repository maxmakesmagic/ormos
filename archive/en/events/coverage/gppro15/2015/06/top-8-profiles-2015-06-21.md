### Neal Sacks


**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Lynnfield, MA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

37th grand Prix Cleveland 2015; 70th Grand Prix Las Vegas 2015


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Abzan Aggro because [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) into [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) into [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is the best curve in the format.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer): Early game attacker, last game threat. What more could you ask for?


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Arashin Cleric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Cleric): I only played mono-red twice, but the 1/3 body and 3 life made that matchup much easier. [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) actually had more applications.


**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

I pumped [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) to an 8/8 then used [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to make it 9/9 and fight a [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) for the win.

Abzan Megamorph. Mike Sigrist said it was good.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector): Between the evasion and the ability to rebuy cards, it does everything you could ever want.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price): People are trying to cast giant creatures. Killing them for two mana is great.


**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

Using a single [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) to get back two more [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s to attack through an army of 0/3s and 1/1s.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka): Gives the deck unbeatable draws.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  

The fourth copy of [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler): It’s really good on turn three.

Top deck [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka), [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen), and [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon).

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) as a tandem.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) because it comes in almost every single match.

### Eric Severson


**Age:** 23 (As of yesterday!)


**Hometown:** Berkeley, CA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Finalist Grand Prix Portland 2014. Six 11-4 finishes at other Grand Prix since then. Will be a Silver Pro if I win this tournament!


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Bant Megamorph: Did really well for me at Grand Prix Toronto and I only brough cards for this or Abzan, but I didn’t like Abzan in testing.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke): Went up ot three to help the Red-Green Devotion matchup. Never played it, but they countered a lot of [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion)s and finally an [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) to win my last game.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen): Going to three is great versus Esper Dragons but also the Abzan morph decks, who have cut down on [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command). It lets you keep up [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke) while developing your board.


**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**  

Round 9 versus Ross Merriam. I curved [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) into morphed [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic). He played  which I attacked into with the Lion. He blocked, not realizing I coul dunmorph, make five mana, and monstrous to blow him our in combat.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon): No one expected it and it took over matches with ease.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker): It helped some grindy match-ups by using [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) to clear a path for her 4/4 lands.


**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**
