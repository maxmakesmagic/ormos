In *Fallen Empires*, a cycle of artifacts was printed: [Balm of Restoration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balm+of+Restoration), [Conch Horn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conch+Horn), [Implements of Sacrifice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Implements+of+Sacrifice), [Aeolipile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeolipile), and [Elven Lyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Lyre). Most people never even noticed that these were a cycle. Can you see what their relationships are to one another?

They each sacrifice to emulate two-thirds of the effect of one of the original [Alpha "boons"](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=global/images/mtgcom_daily_mr28_pic1.jpg). Some were slightly adjusted -- [Conch Horn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conch+Horn) was weakened to be more like [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) than [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), and [Implements of Sacrifice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Implements+of+Sacrifice) provided any color of mana, but the general idea is still there.

Of the five, only [Aeolipile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeolipile) saw any serious play; it gave non-red decks a source of direct damage, and it could kill otherwise troublesome creatures like [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight).
