Four match wins were the minimum requirement to advance to Day Two, but with the ruins of Day One behind us, a number of high-profile teams were left in the dust. The Brazilian team of Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, Lucas Esper Berthoud, and Carlos Romão came up short, and the stacked Dutch and Canadian teams failed to advance as well. Yet, for every powerhouse that fell by the wayside, an underdog surprised us with a stellar first-day performance.


The 32 teams that remain have been split into eight pools of four teams. Tomorrow, these teams will compete in a modified double-elimination structure within their pool for three rounds, followed by a similar three-round structure for any team who wins two out of their first three matches. The Top 8 teams at the end will advance to Sunday, and the format throughout both days will be Team Unified Standard.


Below, you can find a breakdown of all eight pools for the first stage of Day Two. A short introduction for all teams who started Day One at 4-0 or 4-1 is included. These teams automatically advanced to Day Two after their fourth match win, receiving byes for their remaining rounds of Day One. Based on their Day One performance, these teams could be considered early favorites for the title.

 Team Germany 2017* 




 Germany was one of the four teams to start 4-0 on Day One. Their team was captained by Pro Tour *Amonkhet* Top 8 competitor Marc Tobiasch, renowned as one of Europe's deck builders. His teammates Philipp Krieger and Moritz Templin have no prior Pro Tour experience, but Tobiasch led the German team to a 9th place finish last year, and this year they couldn't have had a better start.

 Team Wales 2017* 



Team Wales also qualified for Day Two by starting 4-0. Collectively, their team has a lot of experience: captain Philip Griffiths is in his fourth Wales team start, while Aaron Boyhan is in his third. National Champion Sam Rolph, meanwhile, has three Pro Tour appearances under his belt. But what stood out the most were their outfits: inspired by their country's flag, they all adorned impressive-looking Dragon onesies and received a Spirit Award for their efforts.

 Team Belgium 2017* 



Team Belgium finished in second place last year, and captain Peter Vieren returns from that squad. This year, he is joined by two veterans: Geoffrey Siron is the winner of Pro Tour London back in 2005, while Kristof van Holsbeeck's first Grand Prix appearance dates back to 1998.

*![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/2017wmc/Italy.jpg)  

 Team Italy 2017* 




 Team Italy was the final team to advance to Day Two with a 4-0 start. Captain Andrea Mengucci is the biggest name on the team; he was part of the Italian squad that took the World *Magic* Cup trophy in 2015. This year he is flanked by Adriano Moscato, who has played at the Pro Tour several times, and Mattia Rizzi, a Gold-level pro with several Grand Prix Top 8s to his name. Given this amount of experience, a repeat of 2015 would certainly be possible.



POOL E
======


There were eight teams that advanced to Day Two by going 4-1 in the first five rounds, receiving byes for the final two rounds of Day One. Pools E, F, G, and H each contain two of these teams.

*![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/2017wmc/Panama.jpg)  

 Team Panamá 2017* 




 Last year at the World *Magic* Cup, Panamá made Day Two for the first time. They went on to be one of the great stories of the tournament, cruising all the way to the Top 8. Although this year's Nationals finalist Jaime Soriano Salazar is in his first premier event, Manuel Succari and Saul Alvarado return from last year's team, and the trio will be keen to repeat last year's success.




*![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/2017wmc/Spain.jpg)  

 Team Spain 2017* 



Spanish captain Javier Dominguez is the finalist from 2017 World Championship. Although he lost to William Jensen in the finals, he made his name known to the world. Both his teammates Daniel Martinez Querol and Pedro Lechado have prior Pro Tour and Grand Prix experience, giving the Spanish team plenty of depth.

*![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/2017wmc/Hungary.jpg)  

 Team Hungary 2017* 




 Hungary has a good track record at the World *Magic* Cup, most notably making the finals in 2013. Their squad this year features unbelievable experience at the national team level. For both Gabor Kocsis and Támas Nagy, this event marks their eighth National Team appearance; for Ferenc Nagy, it's his third. It would not be a surprise to see them make another Top 8.




*![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/2017wmc/CzechRepublic.jpg)  

 Team Czech Republic 2017* 



The Czech squad is led by Platinum pro Martin Jůza, who was recently inducted into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame as one of the game's all-time greats. Although a lot rests on his shoulders given that his compatriots Tomas Jirkal and Tomas Langer only have two Pro Tour starts between them, the Czech Republic has a long history of developing strong players.

*![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/2017wmc/Japan.jpg)  

 Team Japan 2017* 




 Japan, despite having a hideous track record at the World *Magic* Cup, was heralded as one of the favorites going into the event. It was easy to see why, as their squad featured not just one, but two Hall of Famers: Yuuya Watanabe and Shota Yasooka. What's more, their National Champion Kenta Harane is a Gold-level pro with two Grand Prix Top 8s to his name.




*![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/2017wmc/Australia.jpg)  

 Team Australia 2017* 




 Team Australia finished sixth at last year's World *Magic* Cup and may be looking to improve or at least match that performance. David Mines and Ryan Cubit return from last year's team, this time joined by National Champion Matthew Sherlock.

 Team Austria 2017* 



Austrian captain Oliver-Polak Rottmann is hugely experienced, with four Grand Prix Top 8s and Pro Tour appearances to his name. National Champion Elias Klocker has two Grand Prix Top 8s, while this is the first major event for Adrian Johann Schrenk.



*![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/2017wmc/Scotland.jpg)  

 Team Scotland 2017* 



Team Scotland has an outstanding record in this competiton. Over the last five years, they made Day Two every time and the Top 8 twice. This year, their squad features two long-serving members in captain Bradley Barclay and National Champion Stephen Murray. First-timer Duncan Tang has plenty of Grand Prix experience, and their traditional kilts and painted faces earned them another Spirit Award.


Congratulations to all teams who advanced to the Day Two competition!
