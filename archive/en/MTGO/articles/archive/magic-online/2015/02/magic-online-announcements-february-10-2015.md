**Lorwyn is for Lovers**


A special Valentine's Day Event, Lorwyn is for Lovers, is coming to *Magic Online* beginning on Friday, February 13, 10:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC-8)! Until Monday, February 16, 10:00 a.m., *Magic Online* players will get the chance to play Sealed in the summery splendor of Lorwyn. Please note that Lorwyn is for Lovers is a Phantom Event, so product will not be added to a player's collection at its conclusion.

**Pro Tour Qualifiers for Pro Tour *Magic Origins***


Qualify for the Pro Tour from the comfort of your computer on *Magic Online*! We've posted a new Pro Tour Qualifiers (PTQ) [page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers) that details a list of Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers that can win you an invitation to the upcoming Pro Tour for *Magic Origins*.


The new PTQ page also features details regarding our updated Pro Tour Challenge Events. The *Magic Online* Pro Tour Challenge is an additional tournament held during the Pro Tour especially for *Magic Online* players invited via a Pro Tour Qualifier on *Magic Online* or the *Magic Online* Championship Series. This in-person event is held in the same location as the Pro Tour and pits *Magic Online* Pro Tour invitees against one another in a single, 4-round Swiss event, with fabulous prizes up for grabs! Once a player qualifies for the Pro Tour through a *Magic Online* Championship Series Season Final, or a Magic Online PTQ, s/he is no longer eligible to participate in either face-to-face or *Magic Online* PTQ Events that lead to the same Pro Tour.


Head over to the PTQ [page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers) to see the full schedule of Qualifier Events that lead to Pro Tour *Magic Origins*.
