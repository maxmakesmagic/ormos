### You, **Magic**, and **Magic Online**


**How long have you played Magic?**  

Going on nineteen years now.


**What is the first set you remember from Magic?**  

The first pack I ever opened had a [Mox Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Jet).


**How did you learn to play Magic, or who taught you?**  

I learned to play from the *Unlimited* rulebook with my brother and friends from school. It took us a long time to actually get things right.


**How long have you played Magic Online?**  

I've been playing since the beginning of the beta, when every account was given a card name or part of a card name. My beta account was Kird. Kai Budde got Spiritmonger. I felt like that was a bit unfair.


**Do you stream? If so, what's your channel URL?** [www.twitch.tv/bmkibler](http://www.twitch.tv/bmkibler)


**How often do you draft on Magic Online?**  

A lot of Cube is online or Limited tournaments are coming up—otherwise maybe once a week.


**How often do you play Constructed on Magic Online?**  

Pretty much every day. I mostly just test out ideas in the two-person queues, and I record videos of Daily Events once a week.


**Do you play any casual formats on Magic Online?**   

If Cube counts as casual, I play lots of Cube when it's online.


### Magic Online's Beta Client


**Have you tried the Wide Beta client?**  

I have.


**What's your favorite change that has been made?**   

Drafting is much smoother—I like having the cards I've hidden automatically go into my sideboard so I can build my deck as I go. I also really like automatically sorting decks by format legality, so I don't have to worry about loading the wrong deck for an event.


**Favorite formats to play on Magic Online:**   

Cube and Standard


**Favorite draft format:**  

Cube


**Favorite Magic Card:**  
[Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary)


**Favorite piece of Magic art:**   
[Mystic Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer)


**Favorite Planeswalker card:**  
[Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant)


### *Return to Ravnica*


**What do you think of *Return to Ravnica*?**   

It's a blast—I think both Standard and RTR draft are great right now.


**Did you play during the original *Ravnica*?**  

Very little—it was during one of my extended breaks from Magic.


**Favorite guild to draft in *Return to Ravnica*?**   

Selesnya. Populate all the things!


**What's your favorite non-rare first pack first pick in *Return to Ravnica* draft?**   
[Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitu-Ghazi+Guildmage).


### Silly Questions


**If you were to get a **Magic** tattoo (or already have one) what would it be?**   

It would have to be some kind of dragon. Keep making awesome dragons, and maybe I'll decide one of them is awesome enough to permanently ink on my body one day.


**If you could play Magic against anyone, who would it be and why?**  

Bobby Fischer. I'm curious how strategic insights carry over from one game to another.


**If you could play Magic Online against any villain AI from the movies, which would it be?**  

Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation.
