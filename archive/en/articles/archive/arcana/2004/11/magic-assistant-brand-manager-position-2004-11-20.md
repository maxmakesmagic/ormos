| *Kyle Murray, **Magic** Brand Director* |

Dear **Magic**  Fan,


My name is Kyle Murray, and I am the Brand Director for **Magic: The Gathering**. One very important aspect of my job is to spread the word about **Magic**. I have a lot of great people helping me. This includes the very passionate Wizards employees that work on the brand, but more importantly it also includes the advocacy and support of players like you. Now, I know that **Magic** players tend to have strong opinions about every aspect of **Magic**, including the marketing. I've even read the occassional post questioning some of our decisions. Y'know, it's pretty easy to sit behind the mask of a message board and take pot shots. What I want to know is, do you have the gumption to say it to my face? 


If you're ready to get out of the peanut gallery, and get into the game, then here's your chance. I'm looking for an Assistant Brand Manager for **Magic: The Gathering**. Now, we've posted this job on Monster, but I have a feeling that the person we're looking for will be found here, on **magicthegathering.com**. You'll find the offical job description and application [here](http://www.wizards.com/jobs/welcome.htm), but basically what we are looking for is someone that is smart (pretty easy to find among **Magic** players), has a good education, understands the fundamentals of marketing, and most importantly, loves the game.


If you think you fit the bill, and are ready to be thrown to the [Tundra Wolves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tundra+Wolves), then apply now, because this special offer won't last long...
