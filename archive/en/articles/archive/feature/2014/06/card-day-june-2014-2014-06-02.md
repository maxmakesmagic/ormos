Bite of the Black Rose

Bite of the Black Rose – *Conspiracy*. Short words that describe concrete, observable phenomena (like *bite*, *black*, and *rose*) tend to be pretty old. Both *bite* and *black* trace back easily via Old English and [Proto-Germanic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language) to [Proto-Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language). *Rose* traces back via Latin and Ancient Greek to Persian (which, in turn, might have taken it from[PIE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)).

Æther Tradewinds

Æther Tradewinds – *Conspiracy*. [This Arcana](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1455) explains *Æther*. *Trade wind* originated in the mid-seventeenth century. As explained by the OED (*Oxford English Dictionary*), it is "from the phrase *blow trade*," which means "blow steadily in the same direction." The OED continues: "Because of the importance of these winds to navigation, 18th-century etymologists were led erroneously to connect the word *trade* with 'commerce.'"

Custodi Soulbinders

Custodi Soulbinders – *Conspiracy*. The Custodi were an order of priests who served King Brago. They unnaturally prolonged his life to preserve their own power, with [unintended consequences](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/299). *Soul* has held its meaning since roughly Old English, which got it from[Proto-Germanic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language). *Bind* also has pretty consistent meaning all the way back to [Proto-Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language).
