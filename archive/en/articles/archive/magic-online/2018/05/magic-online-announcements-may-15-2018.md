*Lorwyn* Flashbacks Start Tomorrow
----------------------------------


Get ready for all the tribal shenanigans you can handle! *Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts start tomorrow, May 16, on *Magic Online*. Just remember: that [Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapeshifter) may *look* like an alien made of jelly, but it is definitely a Treefolk. And also a Goblin. It's a weird and wonderful world.


You can find the *Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby, May 16–22, and players may enter with any of the following options: 10 Event Tickets; 2 *Lorwyn* boosters + 2 Event Tickets; or 100 Play Points.


MOCS Monthly Event Saturday
---------------------------


A *Magic Online* Championship Series Monthly Event will take place this Saturday, May 19. The format will be Standard, and the tournament will begin at 7 a.m. PT. Players can enter with 35 Qualifier Points, and top finishers will qualify for the (recently rescheduled) MOCS Playoff Event on August 11.


Learn more about the MOCS and see the full schedule [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2018-magic-online-championship-series).


PTQ Finals Event Sunday
-----------------------


Sunday, May 20, brings a Pro Tour Qualifier Finals Event to *Magic Online*, beginning at 7 a.m. PT. The format will be *Dominaria* Sealed Deck. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required to join the event, and top finishers will qualify for Pro Tour "Spaghetti."


Learn more about *Magic Online* PTQs [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers).


MOCS Playoff Now Aug. 11
------------------------


The *Magic Online* Championship Series Playoff Event previously scheduled for July 28 has been rescheduled, and now will take place on August 11. Mark your calendars!


Watch for Tomorrow's News
-------------------------


Keep an eye on MTGO.com tomorrow for an article by Alli Medwin introducing an exciting new event series to *Magic Online*. We can't tell you exactly what that is just yet, but we're pretty sure you're going to like it!


Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!



TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).



Redemption News
---------------



Redemptions requests for *Dominaria* will be available in the *Magic Online* store starting Monday, May 21, at 9 a.m. PT. Please make sure you have all the relevant cards in your collection before purchasing the request. Redemption orders are processed Tuesday mornings at 3 a.m. PT. [As previously announced](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/play-dominaria-starting-april-20-magic-online-2018-04-11), the *Dominaria* redemptions are guaranteed to be available for fifteen weeks (through September 5), with a redemption cutoff five weeks later (October 10).


*Rivals of Ixalan* redemption sets are currently out of stock but are being reprinted since they are still within the redemption guarantee window. We don't have a firm ETA yet, but we anticipate that it will be around six to eight weeks before they are available in the MTGO store again.



Changes to Brawl
----------------


In case you missed it, last week [Gavin Verhey announced](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/future-brawl-2018-05-10) some changes that are coming to Brawl. Based on early gameplay data and lots of player feedback, we're making a few tweaks to ensure that Brawl remains a fun, healthy, dynamic format. In order to implement these changes, we're suspending Brawl events for the time being, as of tomorrow (Wednesday, May 16)—but never fear! Brawl will be back, and better than ever.


Build Notes
-----------
