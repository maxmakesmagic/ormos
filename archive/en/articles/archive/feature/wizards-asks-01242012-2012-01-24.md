**Kelly Digges:** There are a lot of cards in *Dark Ascension* that catch my eye, but I'm going to go with the humble Immerwolf.

One of my first and favorite *Innistrad* Limited decks was one that I didn't even think would be a deck going into it: straightforward red-green Werewolves. With [Full Moon's Rise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Full+Moon%27s+Rise), the tricky-to-use [Moonmist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonmist), and the occasional [Mayor of Avabruck](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayor+of+Avabruck) running around—plus the natural incentives that arise when a lot of your creatures get a *lot* more powerful after a turn with no spells—linear Werewolf strategies were both powerful and fun.

*Dark Ascension* not only brings us more Werewolves to play with, but gifts us with another genuine Werewolf lord, this time in the uncommon slot. Not only will this adorable pup pump all my Werewolves no matter which face is showing, not only will it pump any random Wolves I have on hand, but it'll also lock down all my Werewolves awesome side up. *Awooooooooooooooo!*
