DAY 2 TOURNAMENT INFORMATION
----------------------------


Qualification
=============


The Top 128 players at the end of Day 1’s event will receive an invitation to compete in Day 2 of the Mythic Championship Qualifier Weekend. The Top 128 players are determined by:


* Players who achieved the maximum number of allowed wins in the event
* Players who achieved the most number of wins before receiving the maximum number of allowed losses will be invited to Day 2 until 128 players have been invited
* Once a specific number of wins as detailed by the above invites players that exceed the 128 player cap for day 2, players will be invited based on the highest Mythic rank a player achieved during the qualifying seasons for the Mythic Championship Qualifier Weekend
* In the event two or more players have the same Mythic rank, a person’s second highest Mythic ranked will be used to break the tie, and so on until the tie is broken
* Both Constructed and Limited Mythic rankings will be considered for the purposes of breaking ties
* Mythic ranking looks at Mythic #1 through Mythic #1200, and then proceeds to look at a player’s non-numeric ranking which is ordered as Mythic, then Diamond, then Platinum, then Gold, then Silver, then Bronze, and then ‘Did Not Participate’
* In the event a player is tied across all ranked seasons for breaking a tie, then the tie will be broken by the player with the fewest number of losses in Day 1, followed by the person who took their first loss latest in their completion of Day 1, and then the person who took their second loss latest in their completion of Day 1
* In the event players are still tied, then the tie will be broken through random determination

All players in the Top 128 will receive an email from [esports@wizards.com](mailto:esports@wizards.com) after the completion of Day 1 with details on how to participate in Day 2, and will be given a deadline of midnight (Sunday, 07:00 UTC) to submit required information to participate in Day 2.
