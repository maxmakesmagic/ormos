 Sometimes it's difficult to recall what an amazing career No. 13 Ranked Player Josh Utter-Leyton has had in just a few short years. The former Player of the Year only made his Pro Tour debut in 2008 and already has five Pro Tour Top 8s, something only 24 players have ever done over careers that span ten years or more. Utter-Leyton has quietly piled up a resume that not only puts him easily in the discussion for the Hall of Fame, but puts him on a trajectory to be among the best of all time.



He's done so quietly and consistently. But he's also done it without a single win.


No Grand Prix wins. No Pro Tour wins. The closest he came was Pro Tour Philadelphia in 2011 where he fell in the finals to Samuele Estratti. His resume doesn't need a win to look good, but there's no doubt Utter-Leyton wants one.


No. 14 Ranked Player Stanislav Cifka, on the other hand, is in his second Pro Tour Top 8, but already has a trophy perched on his mantle back home in the Czech Republic. Coincidentally, his win came in Modern, the same format in which Utter-Leyton picked up his second place trophy.



**The Decks**



The route to the finals for both decks is fraught with peril. This match alone could go any number of ways for any number of reasons.


Cifka's White-Red Heroic deck could be fast, brutal and efficient. It could also stumble along the way without its best draws, which involved multiple one and two drops and ways to buff and protect them and put multiple tokens into play.


"It's big that I'm on the play," Utter-Leyton says. "I hope he doesn't hit his best draws. I can't beat his best draws, but I don't think his average draws are that good."


Cifka, for the most part, agreed that the match-up could swing on any number of small things, including Utter-Leyton's higher seeding.


"The match-up is pretty good, but I'm on the draw, and I don't think I have any good match-ups in the Top 8 on the draw," Cifka said.





*No. 14 Ranked Player Stanislav Cifka was aiming for a second Pro Tour trophy with White-Red Heroic. No. 13 Ranked Player Josh Utter-Leyton, on the other hand, was hoping to win his first title after four previous appearances in the Top 8.*
