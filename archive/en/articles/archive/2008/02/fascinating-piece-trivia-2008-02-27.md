Let's play a game! We'll name one of the *Morningtide* classes and you guess how many cards' flavor texts that class has ever appeared in. For example, if we said "frog", the correct answer would be "five" (which counts both [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Frogmite) and [Frogtosser Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Frogtosser%2BBanneret). Like this:

Do "Rogue" last, though, because your reward will be... a Fascinating Piece of Trivia!


### Shaman


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1535_shaman.jpg)The word "Shaman" appears in the flavor text of [34 cards](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=Shaman&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=All%20sets), including [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin), [Storm Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Spirit), and [Didgeridoo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Didgeridoo).


![Primeval Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Primeval+Light)### Soldier


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1535_soldier.jpg)The word "Soldier" appears in the flavor text of a whopping [96 cards](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=Soldier&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=All%20sets), including [To Arms!](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=To+Arms%21), [Marsh Viper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Marsh%2BViper), and [Breathstealer's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breathstealer%27s+Crypt).


![Jhovall Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jhovall+Queen)### Wizard


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1535_wizard.jpg)The word "Wizard" appears in the flavor text of [85 cards](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=Wizard&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=All%20sets), which is actually not that much for a game called "**Magic: The Gathering**". The cards include [Ward Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ward+Sliver), [Sideswipe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sideswipe), and [Giant Badger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Giant%2BBadger). But for some reason, not [The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast Customer Service](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&id=9757).


![Book Burning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Book+Burning)### Warrior


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1535_warrior.jpg)The word "Warrior" appears in the flavor text of [84 cards](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=Warrior&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=All%20sets), including [Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth), [Final Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Judgment), and [Defiling Tears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiling+Tears).


![In the Web of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=In+the+Web+of+War)### Rogue


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1535_rogue.jpg)You want to know how many cards have the word "rogue" in their flavor texts? **ZERO.** Not a single one. Maybe a different form of the word, like "Roguish"? None. This *Morningtide* class (which is also this week's theme!) does not appear at all. "Thief" appears [six times](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=thief&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=All%20sets) and [assassin](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=assassin&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=All%20sets) nine, but that still doesn't seem like very much, does it? According to flavor text, there are more [diplomats](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=diplomat&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=All%20sets) than rogues! And the world of flavor text positively overflows with [farmers](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=farmer&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=All%20sets)!
