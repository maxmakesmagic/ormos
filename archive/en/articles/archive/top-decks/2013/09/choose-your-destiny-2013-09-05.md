 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






*Theros*  is coming.

From the early teases seen  [*Theros* Card Image Gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/theros/cig)  to today's preview, everything about *Theros* is exciting me. And when I [asked you two weeks ago](/en/articles/archive/top-decks/old-faithfuls-2013-08-22) to share your pass at creating Commander decks around the two legendary creatures from *Theros* available this Friday in  [*Duel Decks: Heroes vs. Monsters*](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/261) , it's clear many of you feel the same way.


It's time to choose your path on the next step through *Theros*.
