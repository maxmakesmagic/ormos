Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).


The reason we're doing this every week is that the Mirrodin Site has daily updates. That's right: every single day, at *least* one thing gets added to either the Mirrodin or Phyrexian side. Sure, sometimes they're short (for example, [this Island update](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#islands,hotspots;U4;0;) on the Phyrexian side just contains the words "Drakes, birds, serpents ... these things are inefficient. The land will welcome our improvements."), but sometimes they're wallpapers, field reports ... or even more!


Having said that, instead of walking you through the individual updates, we're going to highlight some of the other aspects of the Mirrodin Site.


### Downloads


Regardless of whether you're on the side of the Mirrans or the Phyrexians, the [Downloads](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#download) section has something for you. Each side has three Wallpapers, a Screensaver, and an assortment of avatars suitable for use as IM and forum profile icons.


### Field Reports


As the Phyrexians' plans unfold, the world of Mirrodin is turning into a war zone. You can read first-hand reports from both Mirrans and Phyrexians [here](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#blogs), although you'll have to be on the appropriate faction's side.
