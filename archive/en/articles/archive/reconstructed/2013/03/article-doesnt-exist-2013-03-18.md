 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cardsâ€”and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 





If there were a Dimir, they might have a theme week. And, *if* they did, then I would select a deck and write about them. If that happened, I would probably choose to look at a deck that involved a mechanic theoretically called cipher, seeing how the Dimir would theoretically have a mechanic of their own. 

 That might be something I would do. You know, *if* there really was a Dimir.
