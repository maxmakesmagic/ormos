**Most Exciting *Magic Origins* Card?**


There’s tons to love about the current *Dragons of Tarkir* Standard, but *Magic Origins* is approaching quickly. Which previewed card from *Magic Origins* has you the most excited to play with the new set?

**Thiago Saporito** - [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver) seems very good.

**Pascal Maynard** - [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) was one of my favorite creatures for midrange strategies like Boat Brew back during *Shards of Alara*. I think it has a lot of potential in the current Standard metagame.

**Ben Stark -** Nissa, Vastwood Seer. I’ve always liked [Borderland Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) and this is [Borderland Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) with a ton of upside. It’s good.

**(24) Willy Edel** - Really all five Planeswalkers. But if I have to pick one, I would pick Jace, Vryn’s Prodigy. [This earns an incredulous look from Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa.] It’s surprising, I know, but it fits pretty perfectly in the Sidisi Whip deck … I don’t know if it’s good, but it’s the first one I’m trying.

**(18) Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa** - I really like Demonic Pact. I don’t think it’s very *good*, I mean, it could be good. We’ll see. It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before.

**(21) Craig Wescoe** - There are a lot of great White cards. Relic Seeker seems a bit underappreciated at the moment. The card has the potential to hit as hard as [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and it’s a nice two-for-one even if it’s only able to connect a single time.

**Luis Salvatto** - I have not seen many of the new cards, but everyone is talking about [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver) and that’s a very good creature.
