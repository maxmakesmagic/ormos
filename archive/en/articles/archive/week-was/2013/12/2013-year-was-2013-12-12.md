This is going to be the last new edition of The Week That Was before we get started up again in the new year. As we head into 2014, I wanted to look back at the year that is coming to a close. There have been some truly incredible moments, powerful new cards, dominant strategies, and some pretty amazing players who find themselves in the middle of a dominant run that puts them on the Top 25 Pro Player Rankings. Who better than members of that elite and ever-shifting club to help me look back at The Year That Was?


Positions will almost certainly have shifted by the time this finds its way into your browser window, but all players' rankings featured here were of [December 5th, 2013](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/top25/20131205).

**2013 Card of the Year:**


[Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) may have missed the twelve-month cutoff by a few months, but all of my play with the card has been this year, so I'm going with it. Opening [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) (and [Mizzium Mortars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars)) at [back](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpphi12/welcome#1)-to-[back](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpind13/welcome#3) Sealed GPs, and Top 8ing both, was huge for me. Thanks to [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), I was able to hit Platinum last year despite struggling most of the year, which spawned the term "Ratinum." Of course, [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) has recently proven that it's not just a Limited card, and is easily one of the loudest cards in Standard right now, most recently winning the last three Standard US GPs, one of which was Owen's second GP win in a row.
