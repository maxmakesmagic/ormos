Last year's inaugural [Community Cup event](/en/events/coverage/coverage-2009-magic-online-community-cup-challenge) was a smashing good time and a hard fought competition between the Community Team and the **Wizards of the Coast** Team. With the cries of "Multiball!!!" echoing the halls of the **Wizards of the Coast** corporate office, the Community Team eked out a victory and brought glory -- and a free Momir Basic tournament -- back to the **MTGO** players. 

This year **Wizards of the Coast** will host the 2010 Community Cup between June 7 and June 11 and will once again feature a team of **Magic Online** community members battling against a team of Wizards employees in an attempt to win prizes for the entire **MTGO** community. 

The nine Community Team members, six members of the community and three members of the **Magic** press have been selected for their contributions to the **Magic** community as a whole and we think they represent a great cross-section of **Magic Online** players. 

Without further ado, here is your 2010 Community Team: 

**Community Members**
