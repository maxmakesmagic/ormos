What if you could design your own **Magic** shoe? Would it look like this?


### Gravestorm RYZing

Or would you go a different direction? **Magic: The Gathering** has partnered with [RYZ](http://RYZwear.com) and starting June 3, we're calling on *you* to create the best line of **Magic** gear ever. We want shirts. We want hats. We want bags. And, yes, we want shoes.

Here's how it's going to work: utilizing the RYZ process, you (and other members of the **Magic** community, but let's face it, they're not nearly as cool as you, right?) will download a template from [RYZwear.com](http://RYZwear.com) and design and submit their creations. Then 3D images of the shoes will be posted online and the community will vote to select a winner.

Did we say "winner"? Oh yes we did! In addition to the obvious benefits that come from being the designer of a famous **Magic** shoe, the winning designer will win $1,000 in actual money. And also ... an **uncut foil sheet of Magic cards**!

Starting June 3 it's your turn to Show Your Colors. Check out [RYZwear.com](http://RYZwear.com) to learn more.
