**Card of the Day - vendredi 29 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Demonic%20Consultation)#### Demonic Consultation


 *Masters Edition 2* uncommon. Demonic Consultation was such a powerful tutor that it's rarely even been reprinted in a "fixed" form. One example of that, though, was *Unhinged*'s Aesthetic Consultation, which added a the artist-matters theme to mix things up a bit.  
  
*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 28 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Personal%20Tutor)#### Personal Tutor


 *Masters Edition 2* uncommon. The person in Personal Tutor (who looks suspiciously like Whistler's Mother) is not actually the tutor. The tutor is the *book*, which appears to be teaching the person how to cast a Fireball.

**Card of the Day - mercredi 27 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grandmother%20Sengir)#### Grandmother Sengir


 *Masters Edition 2* rare. Although the flavor text indicates differently, Grandmother Sengir is not actually Baron Sengir's biological grandmother. In fact (as Matt Cavotta explains here), she was originally a Planeswalker's apprentice that destroyed an entire plane and then lost her mind.

**Card of the Day - mardi 26 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Temporal%20Manipulation)#### Temporal Manipulation


 *Masters Edition 2* rare. The art description for Temporal Manipulation simply reads "Show an intricate thran looking clock or watch." The *Portal Second Age* creative team had complete faith in Anson Maddocks to deliver a compelling piece. And he did!

**Card of the Day - lundi 25 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kjeldoran%20Outpost)#### Kjeldoran Outpost


 *Masters Edition 2* rare. Kjeldoran Outpost was a very powerful card in the "Counterpost" decks long ago. However, it came with a price: once in awhile, a player would draw a seven-card opening hand that had the Outpost as its only land. By the mulligan rules of the time, the hand had to be kept, even though it would have no way to get mana!

**Card of the Day - vendredi 22 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Necropotence)#### Necropotence


 *Masters Edition 2* rare. Necropotence dominated tournament **Magic** almost from the day *Ice Age* came out, leading to the "Black Summer" of 1996. In 1999, combo decks like High Tide and Academy ruled the landscape to the point where Necropotence wasn't in any decks. At that point, Chris Pikula made the famous suggestion, "Ban everything until Necro is good, then ban Necro". And that's pretty much what happened.

**Card of the Day - jeudi 21 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brainstorm)#### Brainstorm


 *Masters Edition 2* common. According to Mark Rosewater (in this article), Brainstorm is an example of deceptively simple design. "Brainstorm is never the star of the deck, yet it helps push the percentage a few points in its controller's favor. It's a subtle card that rewards a skilled player (see, we really do like that). Cards like Brainstorm are very hard to design so when I see one that works, I'm always impressed," he says.

**Card of the Day - mercredi 20 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Taiga)#### Taiga


 *Masters Edition 2* rare. A "taiga" is technically an open woodland covered in coniferous trees in the far north, such as you find just south of the tundra on Earth. As a forest that's normally in mountainous regions, it was an easy choice for the name of the original Mountain-Forest crossbreed.   
  
*Masters Edition 2* is coming! Available exclusively on **Magic Online**, this 245 card set is planned for a September 22 release and will feature many of the greatest cards from **Magic**'s past. And every Card of the Day for the next few weeks will double as a *Masters Edition 2* preview! Keep watching to see what other cards make the set and for more information to be announced shortly. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 19 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sea%20Drake)#### Sea Drake


 *Masters Edition 2* rare. Originally appearing in *Portal Second Age*, Sea Drake is one of only five blue three-mana cards that give you a four-power flier. And all the rest either can't attack (Plumeveil), can only attack or block once (Fog Elemental), or give up card advantage (Indentured Djinn and Vexing Sphinx). Sea Drake's disadvantage can actually work *for* you in the right situation!

**Card of the Day - lundi 18 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Crypt)#### Mana Crypt


 *Masters Edition 2* rare. Mana Crypt was one of five cards only available by buying one of HarperPrism's **Magic** novels. Purchasers of *Final Sacrifice* received a Mana Crypt, while purchasers of *The Cursed Land* had an equal chance of getting any of the cards (the other four are Sewers of Estark, Windseeker Centaur, Giant Badger, and Arena).

**Card of the Day - vendredi 15 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Faceless%20Butcher)#### Faceless Butcher


 *Torment* common. Q: The Faceless Butcher has no nose. How does he smell?  
  
A: Terrible!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 14 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Scrubland)#### Scrubland


 *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. The original dual lands had a text box art treatment that consisted of concentric rectangles of the appropriate colors. This was kind of distracting, so it was eventually phased out in favor of shading the left and right sides of the text box different colors.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 13 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Phage%20the%20Untouchable)#### Phage the Untouchable


 *Legions* rare. Phage is an extremely powerful and complicated character. She began life as Jeska, but Braids gave her a new life as a walking engine of death. It is therefore somewhat odd that one of the cards she appears on is the relatively innocuous Swat. You don't really think of someone who can kill with a touch just hauling off and smacking an underling.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 12 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Horn%20of%20Deafening)#### Horn of Deafening


 *Legends* rare. Horn of Deafening was secretly an update of Singing Tree. Apparently, the tree's song becomes deafening when it's transferred into an artifact.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 11 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blind%20Seer)#### Blind Seer


 *Invasion* rare. When *Weatherlight* (the skyship, not the expansion) was on its way to Benalia, Urza secretly snuck aboard in the disguise of a blind man. After the crew attempted to defend Benalia from the Phyrexians, Urza left as mysteriously as he had arrived.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 8 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nightmare)#### Nightmare


 *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. Nightmare is one of only 16 cards that have been in every edition from Alpha through *Tenth Edition*. But it's part of an even more exclusive club: cards that have been in every core set and *only* in core sets. No "Portal", no "Starter", no box set. It's core sets or nothing, and there are only four of them. Click here to see the list!  
  
Goblin King, Howling Mine, Nightmare, Orcish Artillery
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 7 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hair-Strung%20Koto)#### Hair-Strung Koto


 *Champions of Kamigawa* rare. During the Kami War, many ordinary humans were driven insane by the fighting between the material and spiritual worlds. The hair that strings this koto must be razor sharp—see the blood from the player's fingers?
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 6 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Clambassadors)#### Clambassadors


 *Unglued* common. The flavor text (*"Sorry we shelled your village—here's some gold."*) of Clambassadors references Reparations, where the apology is for burning down a village. Naturally, the Clambassadors would have shelled the village instead, because, you know. *Shells*.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 5 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Springleaf%20Drum)#### Springleaf Drum


 *Lorwyn* common. The boggart in the art of Springleaf Drum does not have four arms. The art actually shows a regular (two-armed) boggart in motion, and it's hands are waving so wildly that it *appears* to have multiple arms. Also, it's using fish, not sticks.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 4 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rubinia%20Soulsinger)#### Rubinia Soulsinger


 *Legends* rare. Rubinia Soulsinger's ability was a variant on Old Man of the Sea from *Arabian Nights*, although Rubinia could control any creature and the Old Man was limited by his power. In *Fallen Empires*, the ability returned to the sea with Seasinger, which could only control creatures if their controller had an Island.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 1 août 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tribal%20Flames)#### Tribal Flames


 *Invasion* common. Like Tribal Flames, many cards in the *Invasion* block relied on the "domain" mechanic, meaning they became more powerful for each basic land type a player controlled. While presently that number is five, that nearly wasn't the case.
