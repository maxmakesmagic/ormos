We're getting close to the *Shadowmoor* previews. Keep watching the skies! No, wait. Watch this website instead. That sounds like a more promising idea. For it is by watching this website that you get to see things like the *Shadowmoor* Fat Pack:


![Shadowmoor Fat Pack](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1551_Assembled.jpg)Say, what's that blurb say?


![Now even fatter!](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1551_Fatter.jpg)*Eight* packs? Wow! What else is in there?


![Shadowmoor Fat Pack Contents](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1551_Contents.jpg)Yup. That's eight boosters all right. What are all those other things?


* A player's guide with a complete visual encyclopedia of the set,
* A pack of 40 *Shadowmoor*  basic lands,
* A *Shadowmoor* spindown life counter (that's the twenty-sided life counter, only available in this fat pack)
* The *Shadowmoor* collection of short stories (more information [here](http://ww2.wizards.com/books/Wizards/Products/?doc=218577400)),
* Did we mention the **Eight** *Shadowmoor* boosters?
* One random Pro Tour Player card, and
* A card box with wraparound art by Adam Rex. That art looks like this:
