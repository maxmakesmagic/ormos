Going solo at a Grand Prix isn't always easy. It gets a little lonely. Sometimes, I hallucinate. In those times, I enjoy replying to the imaginary voices in my head. This weekend, it's just me and Mklthd.

289 decklists isn't that many, especially when I've got a jeering homunculus here to help me out. Enough chatter. With three Modern Grand Prix taking place this weekend, we've got no time to waste.

| Archetype | Quantity | % |
| Jund | 34 | 11.8% |
| Infect | 23 | 8.0% |
| Affinity | 21 | 7.3% |
| Bant Eldrazi | 20 | 6.9% |
| R/G Tron | 20 | 6.9% |
| Naya Burn | 19 | 6.6% |
| Merfolk | 18 | 6.2% |
| Jeskai Nahiri | 14 | 4.8% |
| Abzan | 12 | 4.2% |
| Bring to Light Scapeshift | 11 | 3.8% |
| Dredge | 11 | 3.8% |
| Titan Shift | 10 | 3.5% |
| Death's Shadow Aggro | 8 | 2.8% |
| Ad Nauseam | 7 | 2.4% |
| Abzan Company | 5 | 1.7% |
| Scapeshift | 5 | 1.7% |
| Jeskai Midrange | 4 | 1.4% |
| Others | 47 | 16.3% |
| **Total** | **289** | **100.00%** |

**Chapman:** So, just like we suspected. Usual suspects such as Jund, Infect, Affinity, Bant Eldrazi, Tron and Burn are all pretty well-represented. The Modern metagame is still diverse as ever, with a total of 47 archetypes represented in Day 2.


**Mklthd:** So, you forced me to look through all these sheets of paper for nothing?


**Chapman:** Not really. We found that 4 Jund players have opted to play [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer) over [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). The singleton [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) in Infect is catching on, as Tomoharu Saito demonstrates. Affinity is same-old, same-old I guess. I mean, it's always been a solid choice.


**Mklthd:** I don't care.


**Chapman:** You should! It's interesting because Bant Eldrazi has also risen in numbers over the past few months even after [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) got banned. R/G Tron is now a great tool to beat other midrange decks by going over the top. Naya Burn is also very popular, but I've also learnt that [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) have largely fallen out of favor, showing up only in [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Aggro lists.


**Mklthd:** I still don't care.


**Chapman:** What if I told you that [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) is making a huge comeback? There were 11 copies of 4-color [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) that uses [Bring to Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bring+to+Light) as a tutor. Titan Shift is also doing surprisingly well, because you can also use [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) to cheat in [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). And of course, there's also 5 traditional builds, making it a total of 26 players running [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) in Day 2.


**Mklthd:** Do you have cookies? I want cookies.


**Chapman:** No, I don't have cookies because you ate them all. You don't care about Modern, do you?


**Mklthd:** I'm not even legal in Modern. What's '*others*' anyway?


**Chapman:** It's basically any archetype with three or less copies in Day 2. There are a lot of interesting decks, but for convenience, we generally just clump them all together.


**Mklthd:** So, is that how you guys usually do things around here? Just hunches and guesses and stuff.


**Chapman:** It's not like that. Most of our viewers just wanna see what the Top 5 or Top 10 decks are. That provides a quick overview of the weekend. Besides, we'll be posting the top decklists later on.


**Mklthd:** So, you're just being lazy.


**Chapman:** No, I'm not. I looked through everything and sorted everything out. You were the one pile-shuffling all the decklists while I wasn't looking.


**Mklthd:** You complain about everything. 'Stop making confetti.' 'Don't eat my decklists.'


**Chapman:** Seriously?


**Mklthd:** I'm a goader. What do you expect?


**Chapman:** Ok, just to get you off my back. Here's the complete data.


**Mklthd:** I don't care. Find someone who does. Too many people in this room. I'm outta here.

"Mklthd had always hated crowds... and they had always hated him."


And now I hate him too.
