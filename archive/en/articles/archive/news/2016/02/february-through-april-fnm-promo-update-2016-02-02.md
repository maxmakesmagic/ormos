Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






A new month is underway, so once again it's time to take a trip in our Friday Night *Magic* time machine and see what promos we have in store (and in stores!) for the coming months.


FEBRUARY
========


Would you like to pit your will against that of an Eldrazi? Apparently Jace would, in this version of [Clash of Wills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Wills) with new art by Anna Steinbauer.

MARCH
=====


Zada smash! Get the smashiest of artifact-destruction spells and march all over your artifact-laden opponents with this promo [Smash to Smithereens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smash+to+Smithereens) with new art from Darek Zabrocki.

APRIL
=====


Okay, that flavor text is just gross. Grossly appealing. I want one. If you play in an FNM in April, you could pick up a [Blighted Fen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Fen) with art by Jason Felix and the newfangled colorless mana symbol. That's a win for fans of the Eldrazi *and* of Jason Felix!
