Cube drafting has been a major part the paper **Magic** scene for many years now, and it can be found at all levels of play. From professional players looking to unwind with a fully 'powered' Cube after a long day at a Pro Tour to a group of friends with a Pauper Cube at their kitchen table, one thing is clear…Cube is here to stay. 

For those who are unfamiliar with Cube, it is a format where players draft from a pool of cards specifically chosen to be drafted together. While a Cube can have a theme (or even themes), the experience is often just about drafting and playing with really great **Magic** cards. Traditionally a player (or playgroup) will design the Cube and share it with their friends, a process that requires a lot of time, collaboration, and cards. 

While **Magic Online** is unable to let players build and share their own Cubes, the **Magic** R&D team has done the heavy lifting and created our very own Cube. Designed by Tom LaPille and developed by Max McCall, the **Magic Online** Cube features 720 of the most powerful cards from **Magic**'s long history, carefully selected and balanced to provide a truly skill-testing experience. You can see the complete **Magic Online** Cube card list in the [March 13 Arcana](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-cube-2012-03-13). 

The **Magic Online** Cube debuts Friday, April 6 at PAX East; the inaugural event is a 64-player draft exclusively for players at that show. For players not attending PAX East, the special **Magic Online** Cube preview weekend begins on April 6 at 2:00 PM PDT (21:00 UTC) – roughly an hour after the scheduled start of the PAX East event – and ends on April 8 at 11:00 PM PDT (Monday, 06:00 UTC). During this time we will offer three different **Magic Online** Cube draft queues. (The same card list is used in each queue. See below for details.) The **Magic Online** Cube drafts will be Phantom events, so players will not add the cards they draft or play with to their **Magic Online** collections when the tournament ends, but players will keep any prizes they earn. 

For those who may miss the **Magic Online** Cube preview weekend, don't worry. We will have more Cube opportunities in the very near future. Stay tuned for more details.
