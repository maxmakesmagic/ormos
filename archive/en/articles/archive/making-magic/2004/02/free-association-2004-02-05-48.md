 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






A little psychology tidbit: If you ask a person to choose a number between 1 and 10, over three quarters will choose either 3 or 7. If you ask a person to choose a number between 1 and 4, over three quarters will choose 3. One last one. Answer these questions:


* Black or red?
* If black, spades or clubs?
* If red, hearts or diamonds?
* Picture cards or number cards?
* If picture cards, male or female?
* If number cards, odd or even?
* If odd or even, low (5 and below) or high (6 and above)?
* If odd and low, 1, 3 or 5?
* If odd and high, 7 or 9?
* If even and low, 2 or 4?
* If even and high, 6, 8 or 10?

Okay, got a card. Is it the queen of hearts? It should be for over a quarter of you.


What does this have to do with **Magic**? Not much? But magic (you know rabbits out of hats and ladies sawed in half) can be very useful. As [another piece of useless trivia](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-trivia) about me, I was a professional magician in my youth.
