*Shadows over Innistrad* Prereleases take place this weekend, and following that, you'll have ample opportunities to experience the new set for yourself. And some select players from all over the globe will be paying extra special attention to the secrets of *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited, because it will be the format for the upcoming round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers that take place starting in late May.


The Next Round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs)
======================================================


Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs) for Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*, which takes place August 5–7, 2016, in Sydney, Australia, are coming up in less than two months. The format for this round of RPTQs is *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited.


For RPTQs with 128 or fewer players, the Top 4 finishers earn invitations and airfare to Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*. If the RPTQ has 129 or more players, then the Top 8 finishers earn invitations and airfare to Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*.


All participants in the RPTQ will receive a promo Snapcaster Mage as well as an event-exclusive deck box (while supplies last).

The Top 16 competitors at this round of RPTQs will also receive an event-exclusive playmat featuring the *Shadows over Innistrad* key art.

Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers (PPTQs) award winners an invitation to any one Regional Pro Tour Qualifier for this round, and run until April 17. More information on the current round of PPTQs can be found on the [event information page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/pptqsyd16).


Coverage for GP Prague and GP Atlanta
=====================================


Last December, we announced the schedule of which Grand Prix will receive video coverage in 2016. In that schedule were two virtual "TBDs": the Legacy-filled weekend of June 11–12 with [GP Columbus](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpcol16) and [GP Prague](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gppra16), and the pre-Honolulu weekend of October 8–9 with GP London and GP Atlanta.


Today, I wanted to confirm the two Grand Prix that will have live streaming video coverage for those two weekends. Prague will be the home for all things Legacy on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) that weekend, and Atlanta will be the center of your pre–Pro Tour GP video coverage in October.


We've also confirmed the lineup for Grand Prix Prague, which you can find below.


**Match Commentators:** Riley Knight, Simon Görtzen, and Matej Zatlkaj


**Producer:** Rich Hagon


**Features Host:** Tim Willoughby


**Writers:** Tobi Henke and Olle Råde


Grand Prix Prague will bring back many familiar faces from Europe's Grand Prix coverage crew, as veteran match commentators Riley Knight, Simon Görtzen, and Matej Zatlkaj will be providing you with round-by-round Legacy commentary. Tim Willoughby will be acting as Prague's features host. Rich Hagon will be the team's producer, and he'll be working alongside Rashad Miller, Steven Leeming, and Neil Rigby behind the scenes to bring this Grand Prix to you live.


The Grand Prix Atlanta coverage team will be finalized at a later date.


That's all for this week. The world of premier play and *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers takes a week off for this weekend's Prereleases, so be sure to join the many *Magic* fans all over the world at your local game store for *Shadows over Innistrad* Prereleases this weekend. We'll see you back here as we start looking ahead to [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) next week!
