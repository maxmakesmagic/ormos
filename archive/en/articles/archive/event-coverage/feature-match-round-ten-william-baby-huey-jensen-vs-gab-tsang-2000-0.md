The tournament has not gone very well for both these players and their 6-3 records. Gab has drafted R-B with many efficient removal like creatures. Huey has a B-U deck with many staple creatures like looters and imps with solid removal to back them up. Jensen has already won a limited Grand Prix and has been traveling to many Grand Prixs recently including London and Santiago in the recent IBC season. Gab is a local Canadian and a consistent GP and PT finisher. 


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/862.jpg)Gab keeps his hand and leads with a. Huey leads with a [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper). Gab plays a [Fledgling Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fledgling+Imp), which Huey attacks into. They creatures trade and Huey plays a Looter. Gab once again answers with [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer). Huey loots in his main phase and plays a second Looter. The [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) kills the new looter and a [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic) is summoned. Huey played a [Sadistic Hypnotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sadistic+Hypnotist) and emptied Gab's Hand. Gab attacked with the Lunatic and [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) and passed the turn. Huey had nothing and was attacked once again. A [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) was killed by the [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) and Huey still had no blockers. Once a [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) and [Filthy Cur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filthy+Cur) joined Gab's side the game was over.


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/863.jpg)Huey boarded in a [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade), [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm), and [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) for [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying), [Sadistic Hypnotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sadistic+Hypnotist), and [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout). Huey is playing first this game and both players keep their hands. Huey plays a [Filthy Cur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filthy+Cur) on turn two which is met by a [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper) from Gab. They creatures trade and neither player has a three drop. Huey plays [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) on his fourth turn, which is a huge advantage. Both players then play a [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat). Gab then plays one of his two [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer)s on turn 5. Huey plays [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm), a huge card in the matchup given how many threshold cards there are in Gab's deck. Huey [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger)s a [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade) and seems to have strong board control with the [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm)'s potentially devastating lategame effect. Huey locked up the board with a [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) and Gab's deck can't do much to get through at this point. Gab was unable to use his [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) or ever achieve threshold for his [Infected Vermin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infected+Vermin) and [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat). 


### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/861.jpg)Gab plays first but Huey plays a [Filthy Cur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filthy+Cur) as the first creature. Gab has a [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic) which Huey [Afflict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict)s. Huey's hand is very strong this game with a [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire), [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter), as well as other strong cards. Gab has a [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) on turn 5 again this game but Huey Desires it before it can have an impact on the game. The second [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) Gab plays the next turn may very well have a great effect on the game if Huey doesn't find an answer soon. Huey has a good amount of tempo advantage on the game but with multiple 1 and 2 toughness creatures it doesn't take long for one [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) to swing the tempo of the game. The [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) only kills one creature before Huey [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger)s it but Gave has a [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade) that if Huey can't deal with will kill him in two turns. Huey cast [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) after the first swing to see if there is anything he can draw to deal with the shade. He choses a [Scrivener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrivener) to bring back his [Afflict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) and clear the board. The shade comes over for 5 but Huey couldn't deal with it on his next turn and conceded.
