One of the most exciting things to happen on *Magic Online* last year was the release of *Vintage Masters*, and with it the ability to play with the Power Nine—the most powerful cards in the history of *Magic*. Among those most interested in feeling that power coursing through their veins were a collection of *Magic* celebrities who banded together to form the Vintage Super League. The ten of us played a nine-week round-robin regular season on Tuesday nights and streamed the action live on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic). After three weeks of playoffs, Vintage World Champion Stephen Menendian emerged victorious, using a [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise)–fueled [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) deck to take down Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas in the finals.


On Tuesday, the Vintage Super League returns to action. It will be particularly interesting to see what decks folks choose to play given the news from earlier this week about new restrictions (and an unrestriction!). In Vintage, you can be sure that whatever decks turn up, they'll be crazy, powerful, and capable of things that you just don't ever see in other formats. While we didn't actually have a turn-one kill during an official match last season, we did have one in an on-air scrimmage.


The rules for Season 2 are very similar to last season: There's a nine-week regular season where everyone plays everyone else once, with players allowed to change decks every three weeks. The Top 4 advance to a "king of the hill"–style playoff, but this time around all playoff matches are best three out of five matches and both players are allowed to bring three different decks to each round.

The roster is also similar to last season's popular debut roster, with everyone back except for 10th-place finisher Josh Utter-Leyton (who was "relegated"). Replacing Josh is none other than Kai Budde—arguably the best player in the history of the game. The league now features four Hall of Famers and two Platinum pros alongside both Vintage celebrities and vintage celebrities.


Kai will need to hit the ground running as his week-one opponent is none other than Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas. Luis is quite the Vintage aficionado, following up his Season 1 runner-up finish with a win in the Holiday Festival Vintage Championship (an invitation-only Magic Online tournament that saw Vintage Super League members claim three of the Top 4 spots).

Vintage Super League was already the most popular mid-week *Magic* stream on Twitch last year, and Season 2 is shaping up to be even better. Tune into [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) at 6 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday to see what all the fuss is about!



Check MTGO.com each Tuesday beginning February 10 for the most up-to-date information on what’s new in the league. These weekly Vintage Super Leagues features will be written by Randy himself, and will break down what’s new, and what’s coming up in the next Vintage Super League episode.


We'll also be updating a decklist page where we'll feature decks currently being used by members of the league. When players switch to new decks over the course of the league, our decklist page will be updated to reflect their current deck of choice.
