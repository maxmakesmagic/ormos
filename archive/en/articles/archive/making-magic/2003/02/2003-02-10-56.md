You arrive late to the design meeting.

You’re not just late, you’re very late. You can’t even get away with the “WotC time” excuse. You see, up until six months ago, all meeting at Wizards started at ten after the hour. This was called “WotC time”. Ever since the change, people use “I'm not used to non-WotC time” as an excuse for showing up late. Of course, it only works if you’re ten minutes late or less. And you’re way over.

“Next time, try to be on time.”

The team then discusses a variety of different topics. Two hours blow by before you know it. It’s time for lunch!
