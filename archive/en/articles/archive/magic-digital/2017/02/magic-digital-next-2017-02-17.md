 Jeffrey Steefel is the vice president, digital game development for Wizards of the Coast, and starts every day in amazement that after more than 25 years of making games, he’s finally involved with some of the brands that sparked his love of gaming in the first place. 






On Hasbro's earnings call last week, leadership spoke about the success of *Pie Face*, a future *My Little Pony* movie, and *Magic*'s eighth consecutive year of growth, something of which we are all very proud at Wizards of the Coast! Also mentioned was something called "*Magic* Digital Next," which has been the subject of a lot of speculation and debate lately—so I'd like to provide some context for our fans.


*Magic* Digital Next—or "MDN"—is Wizards' internal umbrella term for the entire landscape for *Magic: The Gathering* experiences around digital games. Our evolving vision includes exciting work by [our new digital groups](http://company.wizards.com/article/news/making-moves) to both bring great experiences to *Magic* players and to attract new fans to the amazing experience that is *Magic*. This includes, but is certainly not limited to:


* Upgrading to state-of-the-art back-end technology and systems to sustain and constantly improve digital and tabletop experiences;
* Improving and expanding the way you play the *Magic* trading card game digitally;
* Dreams of delivering deep gameplay experiences in *Magic* worlds and fiction on diverse gaming platforms and genres.

You have seen early evidence of our forward ambitions with the addition and growth of Leagues in *Magic Online* and our recent announcement about the [early release](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/state-magic-online-2017-01-31) of new sets for *Magic Online* starting with *Amonkhet* this April.


We're excitedly digging into an ambitious slate of MDN projects, and we can't wait to be at the point where we have solid plans to share. We're in for an exciting ride!
