Prereleases just took place last weekend around the world, giving many players their first glimpse into *Fate Reforged* a week before its official release. You can get your hands on *Fate Reforged* at your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) starting this Friday.



With Prereleases, set releases, two PTQ rounds currently in progress, GPs on the horizon, and a whole slew of other great events associated with acronyms you may or may not be familiar with, it's worth taking a step back to see what-all we've got going on in the next few weeks (and we'll revisit which acronyms match which program as well).



Let's start with a look at the Organized Play that you can currently take part in!





---


What's Happening Now
====================



There are a couple of great offerings that players, ranging from the new competitor to the seasoned veteran, can participate in.




**Friday Night *Magic*** **(FNM)**



The first place where all types of players can start enjoying Organized Play is at [Friday Night *Magic*](http://magic.wizards.com/content/friday-night-magic-1), a fun and festive time at your local game store each week. Friday Night *Magic* (also known as FNM) is a great opportunity to dip your toes into Organized Play.



The format for FNM is wide open. While Standard Constructed and Booster Draft are popular offerings, stores can also run FNM in formats ranging from Modern to casual formats such as Commander. FNM is also the place where you can get your hands on some [exclusive promo cards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/january-through-march-fnm-promo-update-2014-12-31).



Formats and promo card distribution vary by store, so be sure to talk to your local store for more details. Looking to play a different format for FNM? Talk to your store about getting an event that you and your friends want to play in sanctioned locally!

FNM is also your first chance to play in sanctioned *Magic* with the new cards from *Fate Reforged* this Friday! Be sure to share your experiences with the rest of the world using the #MTGFNM hashtag on Twitter.




**Pro Tour Qualifiers (PTQs)**



The [Pro Tour Qualifier season for Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/qualifiers-pro-tour-dragons-of-tarkir) is in full swing and continues until February 22. For players looking to make their way to the Pro Tour, *Magic*'s flagship professional tournament series, then Pro Tour Qualifiers (also known as PTQs) are for you.



Pro Tour Qualifiers award the winner of each event an invitation and airfare for the Pro Tour that it feeds. This PTQ season is awarding winners an invitation and airfare to [Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/event-information-pro-tour-fate-reforged), which takes place in Brussels, Belgium, April 10–12.



The next set of PTQs takes place next weekend. [Be sure to check the schedule](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) to see if there's a PTQ near you!




**Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers (PPTQs)**



Meanwhile, while players compete in regular PTQs for the Pro Tour in April, players can also compete in [Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/pptqvan15) (PPTQs) to start down the path of qualifying for the Pro Tour set to take place in Vancouver July 31–August2.



PPTQ formats are store-level events, and the format is decided by the store that sanctions one. Check with your store for their PPTQ's format as well as information such as entry costs, prizes, and more.



The winner of a Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier is awarded an invitation to compete in one [Regional Pro Tour Qualifier](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/rptqvan15) (RPTQ) taking place April 25-26. Regional PTQs are invitation-only events that award each participant a [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) promo card, and the top finishers of the tournament receive invitations and airfare to the Pro Tour that it feeds (Top 4 receive this prize if the RPTQ is 128 or fewer players; Top 8 receive this prize if the RPTQ is 129 or more players).

What's Happening Later
======================



There's plenty that is currently going on, but we've got quite a series of events coming up in the next few weeks.




**2015 Super Sunday Series Championship (2015 SSS Championship)**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/MagicSuperSundaySeries.png)




[The 2015 Super Sunday Series Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix/super-sunday-series-championship-2015-event-information) takes place this weekend here at Wizards of the Coast HQ. Super Sunday Series winners from all over the world will be traveling to Washington to compete in a tournament that boasts three different formats, a $20,000 prize purse, a tour of Wizards of the Coast, and a whole lot of time to hang out with Wizards R&D members.



You can catch all the action on the *Magic* Twitch channel starting this Saturday at 9 a.m. local time (PT)/12 p.m. ET/5 p.m. GMT. Coverage will resume for Day Two on Sunday at 10 a.m. local time (PT)/1 p.m. ET/6 p.m. GMT.



Looking to qualify for an invitation-only event like this one? The first step is winning a Super Sunday Series event at a Grand Prix. Speaking of which…




**Grand Prix (GPs) Coming Up**



The next two Grand Prix (GPs) coming up are Grand Prix Mexico City and Grand Prix San Jose next weekend.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/GP-City-Only-MexicoCity-Black.png)




[Grand Prix Mexico City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-san-jose-2015) will be the first GP to feature Limited with *Fate Reforged* added to the mix. For many, it's a big opportunity to show off what they know of the new Limited environment. For a few, Mexico City represents the training ground for the Limited rounds of Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*.



Regardless of your reason for attending, select participants in Grand Prix Mexico City will receive an event-exclusive playmat featuring original artwork from Clint Cearley.

The golden angel on this playmat is the Angel of Independence, arguably downtown Mexico City's most recognizable landmark.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/GP-City-Only-SanJose-Black.png)




While this is taking place, teams of three will be tearing into some *Khans of Tarkir* and *Fate Reforged* booster packs for [Grand Prix San Jose](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-san-jose-2015). The format for this GP is Team Limited, and these formats have always been a hotbed for powerhouse teams, savvy play, and some brutally efficient Team Sealed decks.



Each team that participates in the Grand Prix San Jose main event receives one of each event-exclusive playmat.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/GP_SanJose_Playmat_SiegeRhino.png)




That's one each of a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), and [Brutal Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Hordechief) playmat. Hopefully, fighting over who gets which playmat doesn't disrupt any teamwork going into Saturday!




**Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* (PTFRF)**



And finally, one of *Magic*'s most celebrated events, the Pro Tour (or PT), is coming up. [Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/event-information-pro-tour-fate-reforged) takes place February 6–8 in Washington, DC, where hundreds of the world's best *Magic* players compete for their share of a massive $250,000 prize purse.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/LOGO_ProTour_FRF.png)




The format for the Pro Tour tests a competitor's Limited prowess as well as their ability to construct and pilot a Modern deck. With the [recent Banned & Restricted list changes](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/banned-and-restricted-announcement-2015-01-19), Modern Constructed has been shaken up, and the Pro Tour will be your first chance to witness how things settle.



If we won't be seeing you in Washington, DC, in a few weeks, you can still tune in and be part of all the action. Live coverage of Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* will begin on Friday, February 6 at 9 a.m. local time (ET)/6 a.m. PT/2 p.m. GMT, and we'll have more details on the broadcast as we approach the big weekend.



That covers the next couple of weeks! There's plenty of sanctioned *Magic* to be played at all levels, and we look forward to seeing you at an event in the near future!
