Howdy, folks! As some of you might be aware, a new expansion set for the collectable card game known as Magic**: The Gathering** has just been pre-released. Its name is *Eventide*, and it takes place in a dark and mysterious land full of [Gwyllion Hedge-Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Gwyllion%2BHedge-Mage) and [Noggle Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Noggle%2BBandit). It's basically Anytown, USA, but with talking donkeys. 


It has some pretty cool things going on inside of it, too, just like your body! Also like your body, you won't be able to play with it for a couple weeks. At least, that's how my doctor explained it to me. So even though *Eventide* hasn't been released yet, only pre-released, I thought I would use the next seven thousand words (give or take) to speculate about a handful of the more intriguing additions to the **Magic** card pool. Let's dive right in, shall we?


### Shrike While the Iron is Hot


[![Rabid_Wombat](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/5E/Rabid_Wombat.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rabid%2BWombat)I'll go out on a limb and suggest that everybody likes a wombat. I mean, how could you not? While they might sound like one of the silliest creatures ever invented, they are, in fact, the most cunning and lethal of all the subterranean marsupials. They are completely adorable, and yet, if provoked, they will dig a tunnel and then poop a cube on your lawn without the slightest hint of remorse. They are even crepuscular! I don't know what that means, but frankly, it sounds terrifying. On top of all these vaguely sinister, but totally true, Wikipedia-vetted attributes, the magical wombat also likes to wear pants. Lots of pants. I don't know how they do it with those short little legs of theirs, but like poodles in sweaters and chimps in tutus, these wombats can't get enough of the pants-wearing. The fatter the pants, the better.


The latest non-Wombat wombat, [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike), puts on its pants just like the rest of us: one leg at a time. Except, once its pants are on, it kills your opponent with a series of aerial strikes. Even better, fallen [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike)s can will themselves back to life provided there is suitable legwear available. Now that's dedication to fashion. But which pants do we pick? Well, I'm pretty sure [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike) was born to be played [Edge of the Divinity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+the+Divinity). Born, hatched, or brought by the Everstork; it doesn't matter. The two cards even appear side-by-side in the *Eventide* visual spoiler, for Gackt's sake. With a single Edge, [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike) becomes a formidable 7/7 flier. With two, it's a 12/12. With ten, it becomes a whopping, if highly improbable, 52/52!


Another enchantment that works well with [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike) is [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop). Since you can only return your Shrike successfully if you have an Aura in your hand to attach to it, it makes sense to use some Auras that are resilient themselves. If your opponent offs your 4/4 lifelinked [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike), you'll get your Aura back and be able to flop your [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike) back into play at your earliest convenience. Some of the other Auras from that *Time Spiral* cycle (like [Fallen Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Ideal) and [Undying Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Rage)) would also work well. Traveling further back into time yields a similar cycle of *Urza's Legacy* Auras, but only [Rancor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor) and [Sleeper's Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleeper%27s+Guile) are really appropriate.

Edge of the Divinity
 |

To get the most out of [Edge of the Divinity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+the+Divinity), I packed the deck with white-black hybrid creatures like [Nip Gwyllion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nip+Gwyllion), [Nightsky Mimic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightsky+Mimic), and [Restless Apparition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restless+Apparition) to go along with the [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike)s. Since all of these creatures can be played using white mana, I decided to use an (almost) all-[Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) mana-base so I could play [Armored Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Ascension). The last aura that I included is [Mantle of Leadership](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantle+of+Leadership). On its own, it isn't that exciting. [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike) will become a 4/4 flier (with the chance to get much larger) for an initial investment of seven mana. Kind of blah. What makes it less blah, and, frankly, what makes anything less blah, are all the Goats! If you have an [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike) in play with [Mantle of Leadership](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantle+of+Leadership) on it, [Springjack Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Shepherd) will give it, at minimum, +10/+10. That's +2/+2 because the Shepherd came into play, and +2/+2 for the Goat you get from the Shepherd itself, one for the Mantle, and two more for the [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike). If you control any of the other creatures I mentioned, or the set of [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem)s I used mainly for their chromatic density, you'll get even more (and bigger!) Goats. [Springjack Pasture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Pasture) further smooths the flow of Goats from the aether to your kitchen table.

Since there's an outside chance that making a lot of Goats is not the best way to use [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike), I thought I'd take a slightly different tack. This one focuses more on Cloudgoats, their Rangers, and the production of lots and lots of non-Goat tokens. We've got Zombie Goblin, Citizen, Kithkin Soldier, Faerie Rogue, and Elf Warrior tokens. The deck very nearly had Serf tokens as well. The first two come from a pair of Spellshapers: [Skirk Ridge Exhumer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Ridge+Exhumer) and [Icatian Crier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Crier). If you can get either one of them to stick, your subsequent [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike)s are effectively uncounterable as long as you can pitch them and play them from the graveyard with an Aura in hand. The aforementioned [Cloudgoat Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger)s, as well as [Gwyllion Hedge-Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gwyllion+Hedge-Mage) and [Cenn's Enlistment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cenn%27s+Enlistment), provide the Kithkin Soldiers, while [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) pumps out the Faerie Rogues. When he's not doubling all of your other creature tokens, [Rhys the Redeemed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhys+the+Redeemed) will allow you to slowly amass an army of Elf Warrior tokens. [Mercy Killing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mercy+Killing) also makes Elf Warriors, but the majority of the time, they will not be your Elf Warriors. The last two cards are also pretty hilarious with [Mantle of Leadership](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantle+of+Leadership).

Mantle of Leadership

Fallen Ideal
 |

Besides the token makers, the main reason to go black was for [Fallen Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Ideal). As I explained, it's another Aura that will pop back into your hand if it would be put into a graveyard, making it, um, ideal for [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike). More importantly, with both [Fallen Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Ideal) and [Mantle of Leadership](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantle+of+Leadership) attached to it, you will be able give your [Evershrike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evershrike)s +4/+3 for each creature you can make: +2/+2 on the way in, +2/+1 on the way out. Here's where I ended up:

### Working on Your Apex


 



![Helix Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Helix+Pinnacle)

I have a little rule of thumb when it comes to evaluating **Magic** cards: If it costs 101 mana, it had better win you the game. I hope we can all agree on that statement. Of course, until the release of [Helix Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle) that rule was never really put to the test. It isn't the first card that takes triple-digit mana to kill an opponent by itself. Both [Searing Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Touch) and [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) could already make that particular claim. The difference, of course, is that those two cards are nibbling away at a resource (your opponent's life total) that many, many other cards can eat away in much larger chunks. Further, if your first copy of either of those two cards only does half the job, if you only put fifty mana into it, the second copy can pick up where the first one left off. Not so with [Helix Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle). It's all 100 counters or nothing.

Inspired by a deck from a reader named Skander, I built the following deck using a couple other rules of thumb. One, if you need 101 mana to win the game, you'd better include some ways to generate a lot of mana. I learned that one the hard way. Two, if you're going to try to win the game with a 101-mana spell, it would be wise to avoid dying while you're still paying for it. That's as true in **Magic** as it is in life.


To make the mana, I'm using [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and [Vesuva](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) (searchable with both [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) and [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)) and powering them up even further with [Mana Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Reflection) and [Seedborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse). Skander went even further, using [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) and [Doubling Cube](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Cube). To ensure that I don't die in the meantime, I've got [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters), and, most importantly, [Solitary Confinement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement) (enabled by [Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squee%252C%2BGoblin%2BNabob), Gobin Nabob).


This is the kind of deck that could probably benefit from [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). Unfortunately, the Golden Rule prevents me from deploying the one-sided [Shaharazad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaharazad). Play 'em if you got 'em.

You can very easily build a Standard version of this deck. You lose key cards, most notably [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and [Solitary Confinement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement), but you can still make tons of mana with cards like [Mana Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Reflection), [Rosheen Meanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rosheen+Meanderer), [Magus of the Candelabra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Candelabra), and [Doubling Cube](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Cube). [Idyllic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Idyllic+Tutor) can sub in for [Sterling Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sterling+Grove).


### The Unbearable Awesomeness of Overbeing



![Overbeing of Myth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Overbeing+of+Myth)

It's no big secret that I'm a fan of the blue and green cards. They do just about everything I want a **Magic** card to do: destroy artifacts, make permanents different colours, move a counter from one thing on to another thing, the works. Mostly, though, I like to make mana, draw cards, play fatties, and abuse "comes into play" abilities. This deck has all of those things.

I started with [Overbeing of Myth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overbeing+of+Myth), a sort of [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Howling%2BMine) [Maro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro), and went from there. There are two basic card-drawing "engines" in the deck. The first involves [Vedalken Mastermind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Mastermind) (or [Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests)) and cantripping [Gray Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre)[Wistful Selkie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wistful+Selkie) (or super-cantripping [Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force)). Normally, I would use [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), but that's been done to death (or near death), it doesn't work with [Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests), and recurring [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter)s isn't quite as exciting when you've also got [Fable of Wolf and Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fable+of+Wolf+and+Owl) in play. The other "engine" has also been done to near death and it involves [Vesuvan Shapeshifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Shapeshifter) and [Fathom Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fathom+Seer). The cool part about this one, though, is that once you're done drawing cards, you can use your Shapeshifter to copy [Overbeing of Myth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overbeing+of+Myth). If you get low on cards, you can go back to copying [Fathom Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fathom+Seer)s. [Spitting Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Image) and [Tilling Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tilling+Treefolk) combine to allow you to make Overbeings until you run out of cards, while [Selkie Hedge-Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selkie+Hedge-Mage) ([Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Man-o%27-War) 2.0) and [Wickerbough Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wickerbough+Elder) help you to deal with opposing permanents.
