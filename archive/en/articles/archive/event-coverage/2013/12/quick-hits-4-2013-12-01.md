**Is there any color comination you will not draft in *Theros*?**

David Ochoa, Silent Arbiter —  *“Black-Green and Green-Red, they're both too clunky.”*

Alexander Hayne, Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* Champion —  *“I think they've all got potential. If your combination is open, you're going to get a good deck.”*

Jamie Parke, [The Man in This Photo](https://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/Sunday_08.jpg) —  *“I hesitate to say 'Never' but I dislike red-blue.”*

Steve Wolfman, Semifinalist Pro Tour Philadelphia —  *“Black-Red. I just never win with it. I just first picked [Underworld Cerberus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Cerberus) and it ruined my whole draft. I should've taken [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon).”*

Owen Turtenwald, Dreamcrusher — *“Blue-Red is SO BAD. All its cards are underpowered and inefficient. Giving the 0/3 flyer trample? THAT was ambitious.”*

William Jensen, Master —  *“I don't like to play white or red. They're overdrafted and high-variance.”*
