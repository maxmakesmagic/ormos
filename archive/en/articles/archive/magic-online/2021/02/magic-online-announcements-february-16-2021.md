Banned and Restricted Announcement
----------------------------------


On Monday, February 15, R&D [made an announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/february-15-2021-banned-and-restricted-announcement) regarding the banned and restricted list. *Magic Online* implemented card changes on the same day at noon, and the cascade rule change will be implemented on Wednesday, February 17.


When a card is banned or restricted, players using newly banned cards in leagues have until the *Magic Online* effective time to finish those league courses. At that time, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.




---

Premier Play Calendar Updates
-----------------------------


The [MTGO Event Schedule](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/schedule-magic-online-products-game-info) and [Premier Play page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2021#calendar) have been updated to include events from February through May feeding the *Strixhaven* Championship in June.




---

*Kaldheim* Season Alternative Play Calendar
-------------------------------------------


For *Kaldheim* season's alternative play, we have quite the variety for you. Please note that events change over from one week to the next on Wednesday mornings and last for one week unless specified otherwise.


* **February 24: *Ultimate Masters* Flashback**. One of the most underplayed yet incredibly fun Draft environments returns for a week.
* **March 3: *Vintage Cube***. We've got a three-week run of this classic experience from March 3 until March 24. March is a little unusual for this cube, but . . . well, we live in unusual times and the Showcase events on March 13 and 14 are worth celebrating. Life's too short not to have a little more *Vintage Cube*.
* **March 24: *Time Spiral Remastered* Supreme Draft**. *Time Spiral Remastered* comes out on March 19. Before everyone has mastered this remaster, let's draft some truly absurd decks.
* **March 31: A new Spotlight Cube**. As usual, we'll have more to share when we get closer.
* **April 7: Another new Spotlight Cube**. Again, details will come as the event approaches.

*Modern Horizons* Encore February 17–24
---------------------------------------


The set everyone loves, and back for one week only. This is an Encore Draft, not a Flashback, which means you'll keep the cards you draft! The *Modern Horizons* Encore event runs tomorrow, February 17, through February 24 and features two leagues:


### Encore (Keep the Cards) League

Spotlight Cube Series: *Live the Dream* Ends Tomorrow
-----------------------------------------------------


David McDarby, product manager for *MTG Arena*, brings us a second iteration of his *Live the Dream Cube* from MTGO's Spotlight Cube Series. Here, cards cost more mana, have more versatility, and are more . . . mythic. If you haven't yet, check out [David's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-live-dream-cube-returns-2021-02-09), which covers all eleven archetypes from the cube and includes a full card list.


*Live the Dream* runs through February 17, and entry options are 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points. Both a League and a single-elimination queue will be provided—information on prizes can be [found here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-limited-events).

Qualifier Weekend
