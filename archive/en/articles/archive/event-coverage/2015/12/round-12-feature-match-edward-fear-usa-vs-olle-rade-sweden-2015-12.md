Both of them were at 24 points, and a loss would definitely put them out of contention for the top 8. So Fear was counting on his quick beatdown to take Råde down before he could get his Stasis lock.



**Game 1**


Olle won the die roll and chose to play. His opening hand was pretty strong, he had three islands, a Force of Will, two Thwarts and one Foil. Edward opened with two swamps, one City of Traitors, a Lake of the Dead, a Sarcomancy and a Hatred, and in spite of the hand being pretty land-heavy, he kept it.



Olle dropped an Island and passed priority. Edward played Swamp, then Sarcomancy, but Råde chose to Force of Will it by discarding a Thwart from his hand so that he wouldn't take a lot of early damage. He then played another Island. But Edward had more threats. He played his City of Traitors and his topdecked Phyrexian Negator.



However, Fear wasn't the only one who could topdeck. Råde had drawn another Force of Will, and he countered the Negator by discarding the Foil. Then he played another Island during his own turn before Edward tried once again to get a threat on the table - he cast another Phyrexian Negator.



Olle had to get rid of the Negator, so he returned his three islands to his hand to Thwart it. It turned out to be a very wise choice, too - Fear ran out of steam and during the following three turns, both players played land only. "I don't think my late game chances are good, I'm not gonna lie," Fear sighed, but he didn't give up on the battle. During turn seven, he played a Lake of the Dead. Then he Consulted for a Dauthi Slayer, which was card number seven, and then he cast the Slayer.



Olle was holding a third Force of Will in his hand, but he chose not to counter the Slayer. He then top-decked a Counterspell that came in handy when Edward tried to Duress him. "Off the top, I would have countered that guy," he said and pointed to the Slayer, but obviously, it wasn't worth a Force of Will - not when his hand consisted of two Boomerangs, the Force of Will and a Stasis.



During his next turn, Fear played City of Traitors, and then he attacked with the Dauthi Slayer. He then went for the kill and cast Hatred for sixteen. "It resolves," Olle replied, but before the damage was put on the stack, he Boomeranged the Slayer. Edward could merely play it again and pass priority, now at four life.



Olle didn't do anything during his following turn, and Fear got to attack with his Slayer once more. Then, Olle fastened the grip. He Gushed by returning two islands to his hand, and spent the two mana to cast Stasis. Edward got to play a Dauthi Horror, but after that, he didn't cast any more spells - only lands. Olle held the Stasis for six turns, then he Boomeranged it to get to untap. He then dropped Morphling and re-cast the Stasis, and he also returned two islands to his hand with a Gush before playing Spellbook.



Edward untapped, and started thinking about what to do with the Morphling. He had two Snuff Outs in his hand, but when Olle showed him a handful of countermagic, he figured that the game was over and scooped.



Fear 0 - Råde 1



**Game 2**


Fear sideboarded in his Forsaken Wastes for his Snuff Outs, while Olle sided in some Masticores. The American started, and he kept a pretty good hand - he had one Swamp only in addition to a Sarcomancy, a Dauthi Slayer, a Phyrexian Negator, two Hatreds and a Demonic Consultation. Olle kept his three islands, a Masticore, a Morphling, a Force of Will and a Counterspell.



Edward cast a turn one Swamp, while Olle played an Island. The American then Consulted for a City of Traitors, but his Consult was pretty bad and he lost a lot of important cards, including three Unmasks, two Negators and around ten of his not too many lands. He then attempted to cast the Phyrexian Negator he had in his opening hand, but Olle Force of Willed it by removing his Morphling from the game.



Fear didn't draw another land in the game. He did play a turn three Sarcomancy though, and he attacked once with the token while Olle played a land during his turn. He then tried to cast Forsaken Wastes, but Olle Counterspelled it. The Swede then cast Masticore, and things looked really bad for Fear.



With a fistful of Dauthi Slayers that he couldn't play, Fear couldn't do anything at all during his own turn. Olle got to attack with the Masticore, and then he Gushed and shot the Zombie Token. Fear drew a Duress and used it. Olle's hand consisted of an Impulse, a Gush, a Foil and two islands, and Fear took a Foil. Still, he didn't really have any answers to the Masticore, and he scooped.



**Final Result:** Edward Fear 0 - Olle Råde 2
