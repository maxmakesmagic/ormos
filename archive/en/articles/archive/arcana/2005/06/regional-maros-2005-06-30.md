Top 8 decklists for the 2005 Regionals tournaments [are up](/en/events/coverage/2005-regionals); go check them out.

You'll note that the contributions from *Saviors of Kamigawa* to the Standard scene so far isn't just the flexible [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) and the occasional [Arashi, the Sky Asunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Arashi%252C%2Bthe%2BSky%2BAsunder). [Alex Etzel](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2005-regionals-2005-06-29) ran [Shifting Borders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shifting+Borders) in his Monoblue 'Tron deck to meddle with [Boseiju, Who Shelters All](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Boseiju%252C%2BWho%2BShelters%2BAll)s and opposing Urzatrons. [Clay Pierce](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2005-regionals-2005-06-28-6) ran [Sunder from Within](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunder+from+Within) to complement his land destruction strategy, and [Arthur Morris](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2005-regionals-2005-06-28-0) qualified for Nationals on [Infernal Kirin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Kirin)'s contribution to his Monoblack control deck, to name a few. 

Perhaps *Saviors'* scariest impact came in the form of two [Maro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro)-style spirit legends:

| Adamaro, First to Desire | Kagemaro, First to Suffer |

Hand size matters, all right, and in almost opposite ways for these two \*/\* fatties. [Simon Cadorette](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2005-regionals-2005-06-28-16) Q'd in Montreal on the back of [Kagemaro, First to Suffer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kagemaro%252C%2BFirst%2Bto%2BSuffer)'s board-clearing addition to his G/B Rock deck, as did [Bryan Chu](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2005-regionals-2005-06-28-1) in Burnaby, B.C. with his innovative U/B control deck.

[Ross Freeman and Gabriel Wilson](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2005-regionals-2005-06-28-22), on the other hand, punished their opponents' slow draws with a fast-out-of-the-gate [Adamaro, First to Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Adamaro%252C%2BFirst%2Bto%2BDesire), both qualifying in Portland with Red Deck Wins.

Congratulations to all the Standard warriors who competed, placed and qualified at [2005 Regionals](/en/events/coverage/2005-regionals)!
