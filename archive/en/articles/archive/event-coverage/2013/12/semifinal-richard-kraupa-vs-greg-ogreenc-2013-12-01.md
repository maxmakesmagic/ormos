Richard Kraupa has had quite the weekend. He not only finished nine rounds of Sealed Pack with an undefeated record, but he also managed to rebound after a rough first draft in order to lock up his slot in the Top 8. Now, he finds himself only two wins away from a Grand Prix trophy.


And on top of all of this, it's only Kraupa's second Grand Prix. The relative newcomer has shown that he has some serious skills, and his blue-black deck is sporting three copies of [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter).


His opponent, Greg Ogreenc, had a different kind of second-time experience. This weekend marks the Wisconsinite's second Grand Prix Top 8 finish. After getting through a difficult Quarterfinal match against Grand Prix Seattle 2012 Champion Robert Smith, Ogreenc is only two wins away from claiming the title for himself with his blue-green deck.


### The Games


The first play of the game for Kraupa was [Erebos's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%27s+Emissary) on the fourth turn. Ogreenc had [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn), which fueled Kerametra's Acolyte a turn later, which then in turn let Ogreenc cast [Centaur Battlemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Battlemaster) despite missing a land drop. Kraupa had [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter) on the next turn, but the Battlemaster received [Feral Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation), allowing Ogreenc to attack in for 8.

Ogreenc continued the big turn with a post-combat [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) (thanks in part to Kerametra's Acolyte producing a ton of mana), which came in with five +1/+1 counters.


Kraupa had a solid defensive play though with Baleful Eidon bestowed upon his [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter), drawing Kraupa a card. Unable to get over the deathtouch heroic creature, Ogreenc grew his Battlemaster even more with [Fate Foretold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Foretold), and then added a second [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) to the table. Kraupa had his own copy of the two mana blue enchantment, drawing two cards thanks to his [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter). [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) took care of Ogreenc's very larger [Centaur Battlemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Battlemaster), and Kraupa sent in the Emissary. A triple block caused Kraupa to pitch Fledhbane Steed and [Erebos, God of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead), and a Bone of Erebos ensured the enchantment creature would survive as well as take out Ogreenc's [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) (along with a Unicorn).


With his board scaled back tremendously, Ogreenc was back pedaling. [Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer) made things worse when Kraupa cast it, as it would force Ogreenc to lose creatures to his [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter).


A few turns later, and Ogreenc was behind on the board, behind on cards, and behind on life. With Kraupa's [Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer) forcing Ogreenc's few remaining defenses to attack into a losing race, it was not long before Ogreenc found himself shuffling up for the second game.

Ogreenc led off fast with a second-turn [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), which allowed him to power out a...small attack for 1. Ogreenc followed with [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) and passed, while Kraupa had a third-turn [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter). The mana acceleration allowed for Ogreenc to deploy an early Precient Sphinx, but [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) sent the flying creature to the top and allowed [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter) to attack in for 2. The [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) galloped in for a point of damage before Ogreenc re-cast the Precient Sphinx. Stalled on mana, Kraupa added [Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer) and passed back with two open.


Ogreenc sent the Precient Sphinx and the [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) in, and before damage, [Feral Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation) made the Precient Sphinx into a 5/6 attacker, dropping Kraupa to 12. [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed) let Ogreenc take out the [Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer). "One card in hand?" Kraupa asked before casting Dsiciple of Phenax, which rid Ogreenc of his in-hand [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter).


Ogreenc drew and found [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form), which allowed him to maintain a two-turn clock. Kraupa sent in his Disciple and [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter), drawing a card and gaining 5 life when Ogreenc blocked the Disciple with [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) after Cuthroat Maneuver. A bestowed [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) on [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter) bought Kraupa another turn,but the unblockable [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) ticked away turn after turn. Eventually, Kraupa ran out of flying blockers, and he moved to the third game.


Kraupa led with a second-turn Fleshbane Steed and was joined on turn three by [Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer). Ogreenc, meanwhile, had a second-turn [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), only this time, it was unable to attack in when Ogreenc had a third-turn [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn). [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) was Kraupa's only follow-up, and it paled in comparison to Ogreenc's fourth turn [Anthousa, Setessan Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anthousa%2C+Setessan+Hero). Kraupa drew and then passed the turn with five open.


[Meletis Charlatan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meletis+Charlatan) came down as bait for [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), and Kraupa was happy to oblige. This allowed [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) to resolve on Anthousa, and Ogreenc attacked in for 4. [Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer) was able to make the damage a little less on following turns, and Kraupa got in damage when he could, but Precient Sphinx gave Ogreenc another very real threat. Kraupa countered back with a bestowed [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) on [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx), but he still lacked an answer to the unblockable Anthousa.


When nothing came to deal with the imminent clock, Kraupa offered the handshake.


Greg Ogreenc wins 2-1 and advances to the Final match!
