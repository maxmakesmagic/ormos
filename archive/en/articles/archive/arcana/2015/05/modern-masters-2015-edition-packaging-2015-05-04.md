Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






By now you know that the [English packaging for *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/recyclable-modern-masters-packaging-2015-02-24) will be recyclable, and you also know that [Etched Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion), [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), and [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) are making appearances on the front of the packaging.



Now it's time to reveal the rest of the packaging.



One of the reasons we couldn't show you all of the packaging was that one of the pieces of art on the front of some of the packs you'll be cracking is from today's preview card in [Making Magic](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/mining-past-2015-04-17).

Whew, with that major reveal out of the way, how about we show you the rest of the packaging?

Please note that these packs are for English only. Chinese (Simplified) and Japanese product will be sold in the traditional flow wrap.



Those are the packs you'll be cracking soon enough! *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* releases May 22!
