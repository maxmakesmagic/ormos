Hey there! You look like someone who's enjoying the *Dark Ascension* previews. We can't actually see you, but we have a pretty good imagination. And in our imagination, you would like to know that today has another update for the *Dark Ascension* site!

The Card Image Gallery has every card that's been previewed anywhere. You might have missed something! And there's a new wallpaper with its very own preview card. And the World of Innistrad has been updated with some fascinating information about Sorin, the Lord of Innistrad.

What we're basically saying is that you should go to the [*Dark Ascension* site](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/darkascension). Right now!
