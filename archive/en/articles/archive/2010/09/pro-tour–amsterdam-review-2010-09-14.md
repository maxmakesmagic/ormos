The 2010 **Magic** Pro Tour season continued in [Amsterdam](/en/events/coverage/rietzl-sweeps-victory-amsterdam), and now it's time to see how things shook out. The third Pro Tour of the season showcased the new Extended format in its debut performance at the Pro Tour level. With Extended now reduced from a sprawling seven sets to a more manageable four—and two more major archetypes sent packing with the bannings of [Hypergenesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) and [Sword of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek)—the format was rife with opportunities and uncertainties. Was there a dominant archetype? How varied was the field? Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major deck archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.

It was called one of the greatest Top 8s in Pro Tour history. It was the debut of the new Extended format. And Paul Rietzl wrote his name in the **Magic** history books by going 3-0, 3-0, 3-0 in the Top 8 of Amsterdam with his White Weenie deck to become the first person to sweep a Constructed Top 8. Paul shares his thoughts on victory and his evolution as a **Magic** player in this exclusive interview recorded immediately following his victory.
