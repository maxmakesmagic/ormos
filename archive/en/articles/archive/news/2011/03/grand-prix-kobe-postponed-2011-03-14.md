Grand Prix Kobe has been postponed following Friday’s magnitude 8.9 earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan. Originally to be held March 19-20, the Grand Prix will be rescheduled at a later date.


Due to significant safety, power, and travel concerns across the eastern portion of the country as well as a national call to conserve resources, Wizards of the Coast believes it was not appropriate at this time to continue with the event as planned. Wizards of the Coast extends its thoughts and sympathies to all those affected by the disaster.
