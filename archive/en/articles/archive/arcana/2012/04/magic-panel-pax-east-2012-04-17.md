You should have been at the **Magic** panel at PAX East. It was great! Or so I'm told, since I wasn't there either. Luckily for both of us, though, there's a video we can watch!


This is essentially the entire hour-long panel, featuring David Humpherys, Brady Dommermuth, Dave Guskin, and Paul Levy. It picks up right after the crowd watched [the *Avacyn Restored* trailer](/en/node/662906), which we didn't include because putting one video inside another could break the Internet. Let's get to the panel! And be sure to watch all the way to the end.
