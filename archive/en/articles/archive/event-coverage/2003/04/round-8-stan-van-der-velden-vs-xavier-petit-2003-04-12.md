### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a932.jpg) Van der Velden started with a very aggressive elf draw, dropping a turn 1 [Birchlore Rangers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birchlore+Rangers) and using a [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) to pump it and then following that with a [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf). Petit brought things a little more under control with a [Skirk Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder).

Van der Velden then dropped a lot of creatures onto the table thanks to the help of a [Wirewood Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler) and dead [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf).

A second [Smokespew Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokespew+Invoker) hung around for the Dutchman and got active to remove Petit's [Skinthinner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner) the turn before a second swamp arrived. The Frenchman had plenty of rares to help: [Gigapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede) to dissuade van der Velden from attacking and then a very scary [Dragon Roost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Roost).

The Dutchman found a [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) right on cue and sent in his army with a [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf) to put through enough damage to leave Petit on a vulnerable one life. The Roost couldn't make enough [Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon)s to prevent all of van der Velden's creatures swarming in for that crucial last point of damage on the next turn.

"Number 8 for the [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf),"

Van der Velden 1-0 Petit

### Game 2

Petit chose to draw again and this time van der Velden's draw didn't hold a Timberwatch elf.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a931.jpg) Both sides built up their forces with a couple of morphs and a [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf). Petit took care of van der Velden's morph with a Marauder and then both put 3 power clocks on the table: a [Covert Operative](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covert+Operative) from van der Velden and a [Sootfeather Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sootfeather+Flock) from Petit.

While they raced van der Velden summoned a couple of morphs and then Petit upped the ante with a [Macetail Hystrodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macetail+Hystrodon). The Dutchman had a couple of insect tokens to chump the [Hystrodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hystrodon) and then a [Totem Speaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Totem+Speaker) to maybe claw a bit of life back in the race.

[Goblin Grappler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Grappler) combined with [Crown of Suspicion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Suspicion) got rid of van der Velden's racer only for him to replace it with another hard to block creature in the form of [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders).

Van der Velden took a risk on the next turn to let the [Hystrodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hystrodon) through rather than chump again. Unfortunately Petit had a [Primal Boost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Boost) and it was time for a decider.

Van der Velden 1-1 Petit

### Game 3

Neither player found any gas in Game 3. No creature hit the table until a [Totem Speaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Totem+Speaker) for van der Velden on turn 5. Petit raised him a [Gigapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede).

![Essence Fracture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Essence+Fracture)Van der Velden shrugged as he summoned [Covert Operative](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covert+Operative) and [Birchlore Rangers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birchlore+Rangers)."My deck's a pile."

[Crown of Suspicion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Suspicion) cleared the Ranger out of the way for the [Gigapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede). Petit shored up with a Crown-of-Furied [Elvish Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior).

The next few turns were explosive on either side. Morph and [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) showed up for van der Velden while Petit mashed face with a [Macetail Hystrodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macetail+Hystrodon). Van der Velden traded a morph to keep the [Gigapede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigapede) out of the way temporarily and attacked back for nine. Then the Dutchman dropped a bomb: [Essence Fracture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Fracture) sent Petit's team back to his hand.

The Frenchman couldn't return from such a devastating loss of tempo and Stan van der Velden booked his place into day two.

**Final Result:** Stan van der Velden beat Xavier Petit 2-1
