The City of Lights, Paris truly is one of the world's greatest cities and will serve as the host for the 2006 World Championships. Art, architecture, culture, and cuisine all stimulate the senses as visitors discover the essence of France. The Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Notre Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre are just the beginning of what Paris has to offer. 

From November 29 - December 3, Paris becomes the center of the **Magic** universe. Players from around the world will be flocking to the Carrousel du Louvre with dreams of being crowned World Champion. Along with the main event, there are [five packed days of side events](#sides) and [hall attractions](#attractions). The side events give out great prizes across multiple formats -- stop in and you could win one of five invitations and airfare to 2007 Pro Tours in Geneva and Yokohama, a video iPod, or a **Magic**-themed snowboard. Whatever your **Magic** interests, there's something for you at the 2006 World Championships.

### Travel Information

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds04/blog39.jpg) The primary airport in Paris is Charles de Gaulle international airport, located 27 km (17 miles) north of the city. The city's second main airport, Aéroport d'Orly, is 16km (10 miles) south of central Paris. A bus runs between d'Orly and Charles de Gaulle. Beauvais is a smaller airport that handles Ryanair and charter flights.

There are six major train stations in Paris, each handling traffic to different parts of France and the rest of Europe. France's domestic rail network can take you to almost every part of the country. Euroline buses run from Paris to cities all over Europe; however, long-haul bus travel within France isn't an option.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/protour/images/qt_lg.jpg)*PTQs run daily at Worlds.*The 2006 World Championships is much more than a tournament for the top **Magic** players in the world – it's a gigantic **Magic** party. Aside from the main event, there are wall-to-wall side events running all five days. Standard, Booster Draft, Sealed Deck, *Ice Age* Block Constructed and Limited, Vintage, Legacy, Two-Headed Giant -- no matter what type of player you are and what formats you like, you're sure to find something at Worlds. Prizes include **Magic: The Gathering** snowboards, 60GB Color iPods with video, exclusive promotional cards, and much more. Topping the list of events are a whopping **five** Pro Tour Qualifier tournaments for Geneva and Yokohama, with the winners not only getting the invitation but an airplane ticket to the Pro Tour!

As an added bonus, all scheduled *Time Spiral* Limited events (including PTQs and GP Trials) are designated *Historical Events*. Top 4 players (or Top 2 teams of Two-Headed Giant format) of these events will win an invite for the special Revised-Renaissance Limited event on Sunday!

Plus, the more you play, the more you can win! Every visitor at Worlds will receive a Side Event stamp card (non transferable). One stamp is awarded per side event participation. A full card will contain 5 stamps and is valid for one complimentary participation in an 8-player single elimination tournament (constructed or draft).

**Side Events open every day at 9 a.m. and close at 3 a.m. (Sunday the hall will close after 11 p.m.)**
