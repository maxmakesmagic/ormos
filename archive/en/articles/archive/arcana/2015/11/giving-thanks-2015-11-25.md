Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Here in the United States, tomorrow is Thanksgiving, and with Thanksgiving comes turkey, family, friends, football, and awkward conversations with your uncle about what you do for a living that invariably involve the phrase "no, not like magic tricks, it's a game."


It means all of those things for those of us here at DailyMTG, which is why we'll be taking the next two days off to eat, relax, and, yes, play some *Magic*.


So from everyone on the DailyMTG team here at Wizards of the Coast, happy Thanksgiving!
