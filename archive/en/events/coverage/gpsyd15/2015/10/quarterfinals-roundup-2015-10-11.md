Quarterfinals Roundup

As the players settled into the draft, things began to look a little awkward with colours clumping around the table. Prads Pathirana was Blue-Black-Green in seat 1, while Paul Costentin drafted White-Green (splashing Blue-Red) upstream of him. Kelvin Chew was in Black-Green behind Pathirana's U/B/G, while John Seaton was Blue-Black behind Chew.


Alex Ball was either reading the signals well, or his first few picks situated him nicely, as he went Red-White with no Red or White drafters anywhere in the 3 seats ahead of him. Chester Swords, however, was also Red-White directly behind Ball. Zen Takahashi was in turn Red-Green behind Swords, making it 3 Red drafters in a row. Sugaya Hironobu was in White-Black behind Takahashi, which was a reasonable position to be in, but this put him ahead of Costentin's W/G. Let's map this out a different way:


R/W – Ball  

R/W – Swords  

R/G – Takahashi  

W/B – Sugaya  

W/G – Costentin  

U/B/G – Pathirana  

B/G – Chew  

U/B – Seaton


Ideally, the players drafting similar colours near each other were at least looking for differing strategies, but based on the mood of the players during deck construction, I suspect many of them suffered at the hands of their neighbours. Let's see how the Quarterfinals turned out!

*The Grand Prix Sydney Quarterfinals underway.*


Kelvin Chew took the first match from Zen Takahashi 2-0, his Eldrazi Scions providing enough of a road bump to allow his [Bane of Bala Ged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+Bala+Ged) to devour Takahashi's board. John Seaton took the next match from Sugaya Hironobu 2-1, each player trying to out-value each other with incremental advantages, but Sugaya failing to find his [Quarantine Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarantine+Field) to overpower Seaton. Alex Ball took the third match from Paul Costentin 2-1, and the last match went to Prads Pathirana, who defeated Chester Swords 2-1 on the back of his [Guardian of Tazeem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+of+Tazeem).


So Swords was R/W downstream from Ball's R/W, and lost while Ball won. Sugaya's W/B was reasonably well positioned, but fell to Seaton's U/B anyway. Chew's B/G defeated Takahashi's R/G, but that seemed like a poor matchup for Takahashi.


Chew's B/G advances to face Ball's R/W in the Semifinals, while in a match that will undoubtedly last a lot longer, Pathirana's U/B/G will face Seaton's U/B in an ingest mirror.
