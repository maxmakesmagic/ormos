### Pro Tour Seattle Invitation List


Each team-format Pro Tour invitation list comprises the following:


* Any team of three players with a combination of at least 50 pro points as of the PT San Diego 2004 pro standing. Teams formed in this manner must be announced at player registration before the tournament.
* The Top 4 finishing teams (who were previously uninvited) of each Grand Prix tournament that feeds the appropriate Pro Tour event.
* Teams (who were previously uninvited) who earn invitations through appropriate Qualifier tournaments.
* Any team with a DCI three-person Limited rating of 1750 or more as of the Ratings publish on May 26th, 2004

Renouncing Invitations  

Invitations to individual-format Pro Tour events may not be renounced.


During a tournament that grants invitations to a team-format Pro Tour event, teams may renounce an invitation they gain from the event. The only time a team invitation may be renounced is at the event where the invitation is earned. Invitations may be renounced any time from the start of the event until five minutes after the end of the final of the tournament. Any one member of the team may renounce the entire team’s invitation by signing the appropriate form, which is available from the head judge. If a team rescinds its invitation, the invitation will pass down to the next appropriate team.


A team is considered to already possess an invitation if the players on the team participating at a team-format Grand Prix or Qualifier event have a total of 50 or more pro points toward the pro standing immediately preceding the Pro Tour event that the Grand Prix or Qualifier tournament feeds. Teams may have also earned invitations through previous Grand Prix or Qualifier tournaments.


This list reflects reported match results. Results from rescinsions may not always be received at the same time as match results, and thus this list may change. If you believe this list is in error please contact Andy Heckt ([heckt@wizards.com](mailto:heckt@wizards.com))
