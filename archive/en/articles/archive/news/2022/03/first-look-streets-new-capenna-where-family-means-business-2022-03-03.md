A First Look at Streets of New Capenna: Where Family Means Business

 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






She was someone who fit right in but could be spotted instantly. Brown hair and piercing eyes, each of her steps resounded with confidence and focus: there was no mistaking that she was exactly who you were told to follow without being followed.


From across the lounge, you watched her, slouched comfortably and shaded by fronds. She had her back to a corner—looking out for anyone looking out, and nobody would get the drop on her.


Smart. And being smart led to questions.


*Who was she with? Was she meeting someone? When did she leave? Where did she go next?*


Those were questions just about anyone would ask, but for the first time in a long time, an even bigger one burned in your mind: *Who was she, and why was she here?*


"Compliments of the kitchen."


You turned away to see a server plating fancy hors d'oeuvres in front of you. With a smile and nod, you adjusted your napkin and started to thank them—but their eyes were up, staring out and away.


There was no doubt who they, too, were watching.


*Splatter.*


The server's tray tipped a touch too far, sending the rest of the snacks into your lap. It took a few moments to wipe away the mess as you stood up.


"My sincerest apologies." The server fawned over the mess, carefully working to shift the tablecloth, reset clean silverware, and retrieve a fresh napkin from nearby.


Then it hit you: this was no accident. It was all a *distraction*, and it was enough: you turned back again to see the brown-haired woman stepping out the front door. Sprinting might let you keep eyes on her, but there were too many around to make a scene like that.


And now you were being watched, too.


Placing more than enough to cover the bill on the table, you make your way outside just in time to see her disappear around the corner, roaring away in a sleek roadster.


*Why didn't you follow?*


Some questions needed a good answer, but this one sped off like there was no tomorrow. For someone with so many eyes on them, maybe there wasn't one. That's just how it goes sometimes on the streets of New Capenna.

Story *Before* Previews Continue
================================


If you want to survive the alleys and avenues in New Capenna, you'll need to know what to watch out for. Beginning March 28, you'll meet each of the five families that run the streets and follow along as we learn why the city is important for more characters than you'd expect—and imperiled from its past and for its future.


On March 31 our friends at the [Command Zone](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCommandZonePodcast) will share a video diving into the story and background for [*Streets of New Capenna*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/streets-of-new-capenna), giving you a closer look at the characters, families, and dangers that all live in the city.


Turning the Corner for Previews
===============================


*Streets of New Capenna* offers the glitz of a city filled with power—and the grime of corruption that power brings with it.

A city that looms as large as New Capenna exudes power and luxury, thanks to the five families you'll find here.

While you'll learn more about these powerful families soon, their influence and reach extends to every corner of the city. Seen above, the full-art metropolis basic lands will be available in Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters (similar to how Ukiyo-e basic lands appeared in boosters for [*Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/collecting-kamigawa-neon-dynasty-2022-01-27)).

Each of the five families that vie for strength—and profits—in New Capenna take more than just one or two colors. Family means business in this city, and being aligned with dealmakers and muscle looking out for you can make all the difference when there are four more families ready to take you out.

With wealth and power comes luxury, as the families of New Capenna can show off all three with beautiful locales to host their efforts—legal and otherwise. Borderless and skyscraper treatments are just a taste of the beauty and style you'll discover.


And you'll want to be with a family to take advantage of what they offer. Each family you can choose between has their own plan to be on top—what the Brokers offer below is just a first taste.

If you're going to contract a family for power, go for a golden age version and show off your newfound connections.

In North America, new-to-*Magic* players can join their friends in the Commander Launch Party action—and events beyond—where bringing a friend can net you both a promotional Mind Stone to tap into.
