Which of these cards is better?




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Lightning Bolt
 | vs. | 
Tidings
 |


I think that most of you would probably snap-called [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) (and by most practical measures you would probably all be right). However, [Tidings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings) was a powerhouse in the Standard of its day, and I am sure we can all think of a time or two when we would rather pull a [Tidings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings) than a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), under some particular kind of pressure.


How about this one?




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Savannah Lions
 | vs. | 
Jackal Pup
 |


Especially newer players probably all gravitated toward the no-downside white 2/1 creature. Surprisingly, for practical purposes, [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) was much more successful than [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions) in almost every competitive format, for quite some time! White didn't have the support cards to get its 2/1 through, whereas red didn't (at least necessarily) care about a potential life point downside very much. The many cheap burn cards in red helped get the hideous, woefully flawed, [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) through, for lots of damage, when the seemingly much stronger white version would be scared, sitting at home, for fear of tussling with a 2/2 first striker or simply a larger creature.


Just as we can't say that a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) is *always* better than a [Tidings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings), the question of [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions) and [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) was not strictly one way or the other every time.


As you progress to putting together your own ideas and building more and more effective decks of your own, one of the tools that will serve you well is the ability to recognize the criteria that makes some cards "always" better than others (so you can pick them). We call this concept *strict superiority*.


Let's take a moment to revisit my dilemma about [Gray Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre) in last week's "[[Common] Casting Costs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/lo/288)." We said that one of the things that made [Gray Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre) an eyebrow-raising card choice was that there were more, better, options for the same cost. This is one of two broad drivers of strict superiority.


### I. More Value at the Same Cost




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Jackal Pup
 | vs. | 
Firedrinker Satyr
 |


A moment ago we said that [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) was oftentimes the more effective card when compared with the no-downside white card [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions). Is this because dogs (or Hounds) are so much better than Cats? No... it was more a question of cards that surrounded them. One color had ample support cards to force through what is—on the battlefield, anyway—a clearly inferior body. But what if we sift through the sands of history and compare the 1998 All-Star with the 2013 model?


[Firedrinker Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr) gives us *the exact same deal* as [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) for *the exact same cost*... but also quite a bit more. Anyone who has played with [Firedrinker Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr) knows that not only will you get in for 2 damage on the second turn unopposed... but later in the game you can be hitting for 3 or more damage at a time. It might be painful, but sometimes you will even be able to trade up for your opponent's bigger creatures with [Firedrinker Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr)!


[Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup), on the other hand, is a pitiable and generally ineffective chump blocker.


The additional value of [Firedrinker Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr)'s pump ability against [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup), with no such bonus, is a common expression of strict superiority.


We can say [Firedrinker Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr) is better than [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) almost all the time.

| 
Elite Vanguard
 | vs. | 
Soldier of the Pantheon
 |


[Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard), the 2010 version of [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions), is only cosmetically superior. But the 2013 version, [Soldier of the Pantheon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon), runs circles around [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard). Almost everything on [Soldier of the Pantheon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon)—the cost, the size, even the *humanity*—echoes [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard). But rather than losing an increasing amount of relevance every turn, the *Theros* staple can dodge an [Azorius Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) and hold off an [Alms Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alms+Beast)!


[Soldier of the Pantheon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon) is strictly superior to [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard).


Generally speaking, you want to pick the strictly superior option when making your deck; this is not *always* the case (and we will get into that in next week's "Redundancy"). But just identifying when one card is better than another (probably not very good) card is not really a tough task. Remember last week?

Suq'Ata Lancer

I would concede that it stinks when you have Have HAVE to put a body on the battlefield and you end up blowing up your own artifact... but that doesn't change the fact that [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) is quite a butt kicker when it's good—whereas [Gray Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre) is consistently worse than almost everything else you can play.


To wit, [Suq'Ata Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suq%27Ata+Lancer) can *get in there*. It is tough to find a realistic situation where you would want a [Gray Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre) in lieu of a [Suq'Ata Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suq%27Ata+Lancer).


Adding an ability to an otherwise uninspiring creature can yield even more amazing results...

...but, again, these cases of "awesome beats awful" aren't really that interesting beyond once the concept of one card being better than another *in general* sinks in.


How about this card?



![Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shatter&options=)


In the early days of the Pro Tour, RW players—players who could consistently produce both red and white mana—would often play [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) as "the fifth [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)" (again, more on that next week in "Redundancy"). Sure, [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) was generally a preferable first choice over [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), but given the ability to produce both red and white, you'd think players in the market for five or more copies—who, again, could make both red and white—might opt for [Divine Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering).


It turns out that if you were stuck under this card...



![Gloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gloom&options=)


...you might rather have a [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) you can cast than a [Divine Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering) with higher upside but that is stuck in your hand!


The point is, as unexciting as it might seem on its face, [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) has almost always been a playable card at ![1 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165508im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![Red Mana](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/images/symbols/red_mana.gif).


...which is a great signal for deck designers!


If [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) is consistently "good enough" (unlike, say, [Gray Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre)), then the times when we get a card that is even better than (the quite playable) [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) should signal us to clear opportunities for additional value.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Ancient Grudge
 | 
Smash to Smithereens
 |


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/lo/2014/lo289_wear.png)

All of these cards are better than [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) because, like [Firedrinker Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr), they offer more value than the original card, at the same cost.


You'll note that in all these cases we have simply phenomenal **Magic: The Gathering** cards!


[Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) is always equal to a [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) on its face; and then later in the game, players who can muster a ![Green Mana](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/images/symbols/green_mana.gif) can get an extra [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)! [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) has been literally the best card to play in multiple Extended formats (particularly when players invested multiple cards into plays like [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) or [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter)).


[Smash to Smithereens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smash+to+Smithereens) also gives us the baseline effect of a [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter). But [Smash To Smithereens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smash+To+Smithereens) is wonderfully synergistic with a red "burn" theme, because it tacks on the power of a [Lava Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) for no additional cost. In the right deck, you might even see a player opt for [Smash to Smithereens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smash+to+Smithereens) over the potential card advantage of [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) or [Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear)!


Like the other options listed, [Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear) gives you the baseline text of a [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)... but sometimes you can destroy an enchantment, and sometimes you can get a two-for-one (giving you either more options or more value). [Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear) is legal in Standard right now... but I am sure there are midrange players who would love to see it outlawed! Ever have your Whip of Erebos and [Underworld Connections](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) both destroyed on the same turn? How about your [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) and [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb)? [Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear) can itself feel like a bomb!




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Hero's Downfall
 |  | 
Murder
 |

[Murder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder) was recently re-replaced by [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) as the black core set removal card of choice.


[Murder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder) was never as popular as [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) and saw relatively little play.


On the other hand, [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall)—at the same cost—is very popular. The additional flexibility in being able to kill Planeswalkers and not *just* creatures pushes this option over the top.


### II. Similar Value at Lower Cost


A different way cards can show strict superiority over other cards is when they offer similar or greater effects for lower, or less-restrictive, costs.


Which is better?




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Counterspell
 | vs. | 
Dissipate
 |


Most players will opt for [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), but the answer is not cut and dried. There are certainly cases where you would like to have a [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) in your deck... and in long games against flashback cards or various Phoenixes, [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) will not get the job done.


That said, there are different relationships that are easy to draw.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Counterspell
 |  | 
Cancel
 |

[*Counterspell*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) *is better than* [*Cancel*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) *because it offers the same effect at a lower cost.* 




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Dissipate
 |  | 
Cancel
 |

*Like* [*Stoneforge Mystic*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) *being better than* [*Squire*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squire)*,* [*Dissipate*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) *offers a more powerful effect than* [*Cancel*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) *for the same cost.* 


Burn cards offer us many similar dimensions for comparison.


For example...


There is no *strict* relationship between [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and Incinerate ([Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) is a more powerful effect than [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)), but...




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Lightning Bolt
 |  | 
Lightning Strike
 |

[*Lightning Bolt*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) *and* [*Lightning Strike*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) *have identical effects, but* [*Lightning Bolt*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) *costs half as much.* 




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Incinerate
 |  | 
Lightning Strike
 |

[*Incinerate*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) *and* [*Lightning Strike*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) *cost the same amount of mana, but* [*Incinerate*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) *is more flexibly powerful against particular kinds of creatures.* 




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Lightning Strike
 |  | 
Volcanic Hammer
 |

[*Volcanic Hammer*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) *is a less flexible* [*Lightning Strike*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike)*; all three cards do the same thing, but one of them costs twice* [*Lightning Bolt*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) *and can only be cast on your own main phase. Shockingly,* [*Volcanic Hammer*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) *is still a perfectly playable **Magic: The Gathering** card!* 


### III. Advantages Across Colors Are Not Strict


(... and oftentimes, not advantages at all)


This is largely a repeat of [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions) vs. [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) or [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) vs. [Divine Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering). Simply, different colors have different strengths and weaknesses, so seemingly less-powerful cards can be more desirable, effective, or successful than their "better" versions in other colors.


Few players would be excited over a [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears); yet most players would also labor under the assumption that [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) is a generally better card than [Ironclaw Orcs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironclaw+Orcs).


After all, they cost (about) the same; they are the same size; and while [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) is a generically vanilla creature, [Ironclaw Orcs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironclaw+Orcs) simply has a defensive disadvantage.


The reality is...


[Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) may have drawn exactly zero dollars in competitive Constructed play, whereas [Ironclaw Orcs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironclaw+Orcs) has doubtlessly earned *hundreds of thousands* of dollars across many years and formats!


While there are all kinds of practical things we can talk about, ranging from collective experience to personal preference between colors and un-like effects, we can't necessarily talk about them in strict terms.


Strict Superiority, Basically Better, or Other?


Here are some strict and not strict cards for you to compare.


Not strict:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Island
 | vs. | 
River of Tears
 |


[*River of Tears*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+of+Tears) *has a lot going for it; unlike many other types of dual lands, it enters the battlefield untapped and never deals a point of damage to you. But try suspending an* [*Ancestral Vision*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)*s with it on turn one!* 




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
War Priest of Thune
 | vs. | 
Kami of Ancient Law
 |


*All indications scream in favor of* [*War Priest of Thune*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Priest+of+Thune)*. After all,* [*Kami of Ancient Law*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) *is a one-for-one, whereas* [*War Priest of Thune*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Priest+of+Thune) *can keep swinging even after taking out an opposing enchantment. But* [*Kami of Ancient Law*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) *is way more flexible about when it can be cast, and doesn't have to wait around to be effective.* 




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Verdigris
 | vs. | 
Viridian Shaman
 |


*You'll have a hard time finding someone who would opt for the inflexible and expensive* [*Verdigris*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdigris) *if given the option, but even at the same casting cost,* [*Viridian Shaman*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman)*'s advantages—primarily the extra 2/2 body—are not strict.* [*Verdigris*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdigris) *is an instant and different cards interact with each ![2 Mana](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/images/symbols/symbol_2_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/images/symbols/green_mana.gif) spell differently.* 




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
Gitaxian Probe
 | vs. | 
Peek
 |


*Although* [*Gitaxian Probe*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) *offers the opportunity to play for nothing, the sorcery vs. instant tension makes this an interesting divide. Both cards were showcased in last week's [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*Top 8](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptbng14/top_8_decks). Alkio played a* [*Peek*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peek) *that fit so well with his* [*Snapcaster Mage*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)*s while Dickmann wanted more sorceries to grow his 'goyfs.*

As you might have gathered already, finding instances of strict superiority in smallish formats—say any current Standard—are fairly rare. Ergo, the ability to exercise this kind of discrimination will either only come up when looking at wider groups of cards, or when playing big formats. Therefore, it might be a bit unfair to vilify [Elfhame Palace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elfhame+Palace) in the context of a [Stirring Wildwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood) or [Sunpetal Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunpetal+Grove) that it would never, practically speaking, have ever had to compete with. However, the power of understanding strict superiority can help us when evaluating new cards.


If you read [my interview with Tom Martell](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/277b)  you will know that top player considers modeling on past knowledge and performance a key shortcut in his ability excel in the present (and future). So when you see a card that is strictly superior to a card that used to see play (say, anything better than [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)), that might give you an edge (or at least a clue) in new-card evaluation.


Love,  

Mike
