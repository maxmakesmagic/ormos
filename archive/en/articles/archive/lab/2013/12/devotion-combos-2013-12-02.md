Welcome to the Lab, folks! We're kicking off Devotion Week here on DailyMTG, and I have a pair of decks built around the mechanic for your viewing pleasure. With devotion having only been in one set so far, there aren't a huge number of cards to choose from, and there are a few ideas I'll be saving for later. ([Celestial Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Dawn), I'm watching you.) However, there are some powerful tools available already. 

### BBB Gun

 Black in particular got a sweet deal with [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), and to a lesser extent [Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord). Blue might have the most powerful devotion card in [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves), but having two strong finishers makes the deck more consistent. Additionally, black has access to better devotion enablers than any other color by far. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Gray Merchant of Asphodel | Abhorrent Overlord |

 To start out with, [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) is a card that's not only absurdly powerful, but also happens to have three black mana symbols in its cost, making it excellent for devotion. Although we're not going to be running a ridiculous [Drain Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life) engine, [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) can give your life total a nice boost, making it easier to continue drawing cards. 


[Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm) is another card-drawing enchantment with three black mana symbols. Although your opponent can exile cards from his or her graveyard to stop you from getting an extra card, it's likely that he or she won't have enough cards there to keep it up for long, especially early in the game. It's also nice that [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm)'s ability happens during your upkeep rather than your draw step, so it won't be affected by [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence). 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Necropotence | Gravestorm |


[Murderous Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Betrayal) also gives you a lot of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) for your buck with that good ol' triple-black mana cost. Although less useful than the other two, it's mostly here to enable devotion. However, sometimes the ability to get rid of a certain creature can be crucial. Although much of the time it won't be worth the high cost [Murderous Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Betrayal) charges, when it is, you'll be glad to have the option. 

 So far, this is just a plain old devotion deck. I still need to add that little bit of Johnny flair. I considered a few options, such as reanimation and cloning, but in the end, flickering seemed like the best way to go. With cards like [Cloudshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift), [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink), [Otherworldly Journey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey), and—of course—[Flicker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flicker), you can trigger the devotion abilities repeatedly. [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) can easily drain all your opponent's life in a single turn, and [Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord) can pump out a vast army of Harpy tokens. 


[Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord) and [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) both require a fair bit of mana to cast. Fortunately, there are some lands that can handle that problem without costing precious deck space. [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) is an obvious choice. Its ability breaks even with just one enchantment on the battlefield, so with a second you're getting three extra mana out of the deal. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Cloudshift | Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx |


[Cabal Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers) can't reach such heights so quickly, but it's also more consistent, giving you extra mana even if you only have that one enchantment, so long as you have enough Swamps. [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth) allows [Cabal Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers) to count both itself and Nykthos, and also makes each of them tap for black mana. This reduces the strain they can put on you early in the game, when you might not have enough Swamps to get started. 

 Finally, I'll include a few copies of [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile). Although [Murderous Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Betrayal) gives you removal in a pinch, it's nice to have a way to deal with creatures that doesn't cost half your life total. I considered [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) as well, but since this deck is trying to deal a large but finite amount of damage all at once, giving your opponent extra life seemed risky.

### It's Not Easy

 Red's devotion card is pretty similar to [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), and white and blue both have token-makers, which felt too similar to [Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord). Therefore, I turned to green for the second deck. Green actually has the most devotion cards at the moment. [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple) can give your life total a boost, although [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) does it better. [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) can become a very large creature, but with no other abilities it's not very promising for a combo deck. 


[Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte), on the other hand, can make enormous amounts of mana. It's usually worse than having [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) in a normal deck, but being a creature comes with its own set of advantages. The biggest one is that creatures are much easier to untap than lands. 


[Freed from the Real](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Freed+from+the+Real) and [Pemmin's Aura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pemmin%27s+Aura) have served me well over the years. You'd be surprised at how often the ability to untap a creature repeatedly comes in handy. The only problem here is that they require blue mana to do the job. [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) produces green mana. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Karametra's Acolyte | Freed from the Real |

 As usual, however, there's a card for that. With [Mycosynth Lattice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycosynth+Lattice) on the board, your cards stop being so prejudicial. Green mana is just as good as blue mana, and vice versa. Therefore, you can tap [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) for however much mana, then use one of that to untap it, repeating the process indefinitely. Although the Lattice also makes all permanents colorless artifacts, it doesn't fiddle with the mana costs of those permanents, so devotion still works the same as it normally would. 


[Worldly Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor) and [Sylvan Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Tutor) can make sure you have [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte), and with both Freed From the Real and [Pemmin's Aura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pemmin%27s+Aura), that bit shouldn't be a problem. [Mycosynth Lattice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycosynth+Lattice), on the other hand, could use a backup. [Prismatic Omen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen) won't give you infinite mana, but it will give you a lot of it. With each of your lands tapping for blue, you should be able to activate [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) enough times to exceed twenty mana, provided your devotion is high enough. 

 I'll also include a copy of [Realmwright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Realmwright). It's not as effective as [Prismatic Omen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen), but you can find it with [Worldly Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor) if you need to. You do have to be careful here, since [Realmwright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Realmwright) only allows you to choose one color of mana to produce. If you choose blue in order to get the mana, you'll need to have a [Stomping Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) in order to cast your win condition. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Mycosynth Lattice | Realmwright |

 Speaking of win conditions, I selected [Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire) as the primary method of victory. With [Mycosynth Lattice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycosynth+Lattice) and [Prismatic Omen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen) making color less of an issue, [Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire) becomes not only possible, but rather easy to cast. It kills your opponent on the spot, and it can't be countered. This makes it far better than anything green can muster. 

 I also wanted a win condition that you can search for with [Worldly Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor). I selected [Maga, Traitor to Mortals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maga%2C+Traitor+to+Mortals), since he can also win the game on the spot. He does require three black mana, however, so you'll need to have some extra lands to cast him if you're using [Prismatic Omen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen). 


[Prismatic Omen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen) can provide a little devotion, but not nearly enough for [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) to make twenty mana without the infinite combo. Therefore, I included two devotion-boosters. The first is [Gaea's Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Touch). It can accelerate your mana significantly if you have a basic Forest or two in your hand, and it has two green mana symbols in its cost. It can also be sacrificed later on, giving you two extra green mana to work with. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Prismatic Omen | Gaea's Touch |

 Finally, [Briar Patch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briar+Patch) was my other devotion pick. As an enchantment, it's less vulnerable to removal, and it has an ability that can be quite valuable depending on what deck you're facing. Although it doesn't come near the power level of the black devotion-boosting enchantments, nothing really does. This is unfortunately about as good as you're going to get in green.

### Devotion Commotion

Our two devoted decks are ready to rumble, so it's time to take it down to the arena. Whose zealous idealism will provide the strength to prevail? Will the Merchant's devotion to capitalism buy him the win, or will the Acolyte's devotion to nature let her grow to overcome the challenge? There's only one way to find out.


**Game 1**


 The Merchant won the roll and led off with [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth). The Acolyte used [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) to find a [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) and ended the turn. The Merchant played [Godless Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine) and passed the turn, and the Acolyte fetched another [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) before passing back. 

 The Merchant played a Swamp and cast [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm), then ended the turn. The Acolyte cast [Worldly Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor) during the end step. She put [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) on top of the library. The Acolyte played a Forest, cast [Briar Patch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briar+Patch), and ended the turn. The Merchant's [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm) triggered, and the Acolyte exiled [Worldly Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor). The Merchant cast [Murderous Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Betrayal) and passed the turn. 

 The Acolyte used [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) to find [Stomping Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground), paying 2 life to put it onto the battlefield untapped. She cast [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) and ended the turn. The Acolyte exiled a land to the Merchant's [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm), and the Merchant passed the turn. 

 The Acolyte played a forest and cast [Sylvan Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Tutor), finding [Realmwright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Realmwright). [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) tapped for three mana to help cast a second [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte). She then cast [Freed from the Real](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Freed+from+the+Real) on the tapped Acolyte and passed the turn. 

 The Acolyte exiled [Sylvan Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Tutor) to [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm). The Merchant played a Swamp, then cast [Flicker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flicker) on the enchanted Acolyte, making Freed From the Real fall off. He passed the turn. The Acolyte cast [Realmwright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Realmwright), choosing Island, and ended the turn. 

 The Acolyte exiled a land to [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm), and the Merchant used [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats) to find [Godless Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine). He passed the turn. The Acolyte cast [Prismatic Omen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen) and passed back. The Acolyte exiled another land from the graveyard, and the Merchant passed the turn with no play. The Acolyte cast a third copy of [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) and passed the turn. 

 The Merchant used another [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats) to get a [Godless Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine) and ended the turn. The Acolyte tapped the three [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte)s for a total of eighteen mana, then used lands to cast [Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire) for 23, ending the game. 

![Banefire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Banefire)
**Game 2**


 The Merchant fetched [Godless Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine) with [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) to start things off, and the Acolyte played a [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool). The Merchant played a Swamp and passed the turn. The Acolyte used [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) to get another [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool), then cast [Sylvan Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Tutor), searching up [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte). The Merchant played [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) and ended his turn. 

 The Acolyte found a Forest with [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs), then cast [Briar Patch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briar+Patch) and passed the turn. The Merchant used [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats) to find another [Godless Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine), paying 2 life to put it onto the battlefield untapped. He cast [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm) and passed the turn. The Acolyte played a Forest, then cast [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) and passed back. 

 The Acolyte exiled a land to [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm), and the Merchant cast [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence), paying 5 life before ending his turn. The Acolyte played a [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool), then cast two copies of [Prismatic Omen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen). She passed the turn, exiling another land to [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm). The Merchant played [Cabal Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers), then paid 4 life to [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) and passed the turn. 

 The Acolyte played [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) and sacrificed it to search for a Forest. She cast [Briar Patch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briar+Patch) and attacked for 1 with [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte). She then passed the turn, exiling the land to [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm). The Merchant played [Godless Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine) and cast [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm) and [Murderous Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Betrayal). He paid 3 life to [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence), dropping to 2, then dropped to 1 to activate [Murderous Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Betrayal), killing [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte). He passed the turn, and The Acolyte cast [Worldly Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor), finding another copy of [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte). 

 She played the new Acolyte and passed the turn, exiling [Worldly Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor) and [Sylvan Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Tutor) to the [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm)s. The Merchant played a Swamp and cast [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) before passing the turn. The Acolyte attacked for 1, and the Merchant cast [Flicker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flicker) to stop the creature. She cast [Pemmin's Aura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pemmin%27s+Aura) on [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) and passed the turn. 

 The Merchant drew a card from [Gravestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravestorm), but was still strangely unable to find an [Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord) or [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), despite having gone through half the deck. [Karametra's Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karametra%27s+Acolyte) finished it with an attack for 1.

### Ready, Set, Combos

Last week, I asked you all to send me suggestions of sets to work from for next week's article. The results are in, and they are far more varied than I anticipated. Make sure to tune in then to see which sets won the vote, and what crazy decks I decided to build from them. See ya!
