The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 19, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by pinch hitters, as Chris and Alison will be taking over the Daily *Magic* Update for me tomorrow while I inexplicably glide through the air in a steel tube on my way to a far-off land.


Today's Must
============


1. [Approaching Innistrad Limited (Videos)](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13226&writer=Conley+Woods&articledate=4-19-2016) | TCGPlayer | Conley Woods

Looking to improve your *Shadows over Innistrad* drafting skills? Or just looking to draft that [Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) deck one more time? Or twelve more times? Whatever your goals, Conley Woods can help. Well, as long as those goals are about *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited. This video series plus an article covers the synergy versus power conundrum and dives through drafting with a video to put those practices to work.


In Case You're Busy
===================


1. [Twitch Highlights](https://www.twitch.tv/magic/profile/highlights)

We know you're busy. You have *Magic* to play, collections to organize, trades to make—and maybe things like eating, sleeping, or doing things that don't have to do with *Magic*. If you're weird like that. That means you don't always get to watch all the coverage you'd like. It's sad, we know.


But fret not! We have a solution.


For the Pro Tour—and the Grand Prix that are covered around the Pro Tour—we'll be updating a Twitch Highlights page where you can easily navigate to certain rounds or important points in the tournament. You can always find that page at [twitch.tv/magic/profile/highlights](https://www.twitch.tv/magic/profile/highlights), and you can usually find the video there before it ends up on YouTube.


So go ahead and do other things with your weekend! Twitch *Magic* Highlights will be there for you.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [An Update on Jake](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/an-update-on-jake) | MTGGoldfish

Jake Stiles, a writer for MTGGoldfish and by all accounts a wonderful human being is, as of this writing, in critical condition following cardiac arrest. He's a fantastic writer and *Magic* community member, and our thoughts are all with him.


If you're not familiar with [Jake's work](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/search?author=50), now's a good time to become familiar. He creates a lot of Pauper content and the very cool This Is That series, which recently [interviewed Dave Humpherys](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/this-is-that-shadows-over-innistrad-with-dave-humpherys), lead developer of *Shadows over Innistrad*. You can leave encouragement and words of support on [the article here](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/an-update-on-jake), and they will be forwarded to his family.


1. [Annoying Mono-White Hate Bears/Death and Taxes Modern Deck Tech for *Magic: The Gathering*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJmK7gquFhg) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Wedge discusses "the trolliest deck in the format"—Mono-White Hate Bears. The quintessential disruptive white attacking deck—also known as Death and Taxes (because it taxes your resources and kills you)—Hate Bears is the perfect deck for players who want their opponent to look at their hand, look at the board, look at their hand, slump in their chair, and pass the turn having done nothing.

1. [Drawing Live—The New Spider Spawning](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/04/drawing-live-the-new-spider-spawning/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Zach Barash

It's really not a question of *if*, but *when* this weekend at [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) we'll see a sweet [Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) deck on camera. You know how I know that will happen?


Because I get to pick the feature matches.


Get prepared by reading Zach Barash's primer on the greatest Draft archetype since [Spider Spawning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning).

The epic conclusion to the three-part Pauper review of *Shadows over Innistrad* has finally arrived! As part of Pauper Day on [PureMTGO](http://puremtgo.com/) (there are two other Pauper articles today), this article reviews, in depth, the Pauper possibilities people might play if they had their pick of playable Pauper cards.


1. [Everything You Need to Know about Mill](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/everything-you-need-know-mill) |Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

To "mill," in *Magic* parlance, is to put cards directly from the library to the graveyard (or occasionally straight to exile). Milling is rarely a viable tournament strategy, but is a fun, alternate way to win that's very popular among players who would rather have fun than win a Grand Prix. So like 90% of *Magic* players. Suffice to say, milling people is a fun way to try to win a game of *Magic*, and the Masters of Modern are here to tell you *everything* about it. Yes, everything. I'm assuming they'll be starting with [Millstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) (the strategy's namesake) and working their way up through history. They should be done with this podcast in a few years.


What's that? It's just over an hour? Well, that's an efficient trip through everything mill.

It's almost time for the Pro Tour! It's almost time for the Pro Tour! When you read this, chances are good I'll be flying somewhere over the United States or the Atlantic Ocean on my way to Madrid. Once there, I'll get to watch players like Jon Finkel battling for—well, he already has fame, success, and Pro Tour trophies, but not everyone is Jon Finkel. Want more proof of that? Check out his [#mtgcharts](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgcharts?src=hash) entry, especially some of his early win percentages, which were absurd.


1. [Richard Garfield's rules for creating a new *Magic* set, circa 1993](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4ffhz8/richard_garfields_rules_for_creating_a_new_magic/)

This is a cool blast from the past. Reddit user themisprintguy dug up this document from Richard Garfield detailing rules for creating *Magic* sets (it's referred to as "Mana Clash" in the document, which was occasionally what it was called internally before release). It's amazing how much has survived since then, and how much has changed drastically.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [The Storm Scale Database](https://sylvhem.tumblr.com/post/143025583237/the-storm-scale-database)

Mark Rosewater occasionally writes about something he calls "[The Storm Scale](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/storm-scale-khans-tarkir-block-2016-02-29)," which uses a number of metrics to gauge how likely a mechanic is to return in the future. One enterprising Tumblr user—sylvhem—created a database of all of Rosewater's rankings. It's a cool little project exactly like you would expect from our awesome Tumblr users.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Blue-Red Tutelage](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=101088)

I bet you thought the loss of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) killed the deck based around [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage).


False!


Everyone's favorite groan-inducing matchup is apparently still alive, thanks to Noah Walker, who finished 4th at the StarCityGames.com Standard Open this past weekend.


The deck looks to use [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) to deck opponents by drawing extra cards quickly. In previous iterations, this meant [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). With no [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) around, [Oath of Jace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Jace) has become the "draw three" of choice. When you're just looking for as many Tutelage triggers as possible, the discard clause doesn't really matter.


The real new addition is [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller), which can get the most out of its zero ability in this deck, often triggering [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) half a dozen times. It's strange, but that's sometimes the fastest way to win in this deck—even when the way is clear for two 3/1 attackers.


It's interesting that the deck doesn't play any [Pyromancer's Goggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles), considering how great they are with [Tormenting Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice) and [Magmatic Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magmatic+Insight), but the deck really can only afford so many cards that do nothing on their own, and [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) is already king of that.


Because if you're going to do nothing, do nothing with style.
