### 
Jasper Johnson-Epstein


**Age:** 25


**Hometown:** Madison, WI


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Two Pro Tour Top 50 appearances, five Pro Tour appearances, too many Grand Prix close calls.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Burn. It has served me well for many years, so I saw no reason to give it up.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). My very favorite *Magic* card, it provided some very useful angles of attack by mowing down opposing creatures and players indiscriminately and despite blockers.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Electrickery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrickery). It’s the best creature control you can find against Affinity, Bogles and Infect.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?** [Footsteps of the Goryo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Footsteps+of+the+Goryo)/[Protean Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hulk) combo. A blast from the blast.


**Are you and Ally against the Eldrazi, or resigned to be consumed by them?** Who am I to stand against Emrakul?

Joseph Reiter


**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Omaha, NE


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** 42nd at Grand Prix Omaha


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Affinity. I couldn’t build a Grixis Control or Grixis Twin list that I liked, so I went to Affinity as a fallback.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). There’s something amazing about top decking five or more points of damage when you need it.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Ghirapur Æther Grid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+%C3%86ther+Grid). The card was amazing in creature matchups and really sealed the deal for some of my games.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?** A Naya Zoo deck similar to the Naya Blitz back in *Return to Ravnica-Innistrad* Standard. I haven’t seen [Burning-Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary) or [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) in a while.


**Are you and Ally against the Eldrazi, or resigned to be consumed by them?** Against the Eldrazi. Maybe I ignite my spark!

Brian Braun-Duin


**Age:** 29


**Hometown:** Roanoke, VA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Won Grand Prix New Jersey and Louisville.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Blue-Red Twin. Was lost in Modern and Sam Pardee said it was great so I blindly followed him.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). Easily one of the top five cards in Modern, maybe the best.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm). It killed a lot of 1/1 spirits and other assorted small things.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?** Elves. It’s not too weird but most of my matches were against known quantities.


**Are you and Ally against the Eldrazi, or resigned to be consumed by them?** Resigned to be consumed.

Paul Rietzl


**Age:** 30


**Hometown:** Scottsdale, AZ


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Pro Tour Hall of Fame member; four Pro Tour Top 8s and 13 Grand Prix Top 8s.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Merfolk. I haven’t dusted off Revised Islands in a while.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)! It’s very hard to play against.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). It’s to be able to interact with my linear aggro deck.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?** Elves!


**Are you and Ally against the Eldrazi, or resigned to be consumed by them?** Truly resigned.

Andrew Sullano


**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Dallas, TX


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Day 2 at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* and *Avacyn Restored.* I also rode in the same car as Zac Elsik.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Elves, because I own foil [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid)s.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid), because I got to play my entire hand.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus). It’s got protection from black and is uncounterable.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?** Merfolk, because [Hibernation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hibernation) is a thing.


**Are you and Ally against the Eldrazi, or resigned to be consumed by them?** Ally.

Zac Elsik


**Age:** 28


**Hometown:** Dallas, TX


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** 17th at Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** Lantern Control because it has the highest win-rate against all non-Burn Modern decks.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Lantern of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+of+Insight). It removes variance from my opponent’s and my draws.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Welding Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar). It’s a one-for-one answer to sideboard cards from my opponent.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?** Gerry Thompson’s Grixis Jace value deck with [Rise // Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall).


**Are you and Ally against the Eldrazi, or resigned to be consumed by them?** Ally.

**Hometown:** Albuquerque, NM


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Two State Championships.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?** [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift), because it’s a one-card combo.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?** [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) and/or [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). It’s great against all kinds of different decks.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?** Nothing special.


**Are you and Ally against the Eldrazi, or resigned to be consumed by them?** Well, I win games with a *Zendikar* land ([Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle)) so…. kill all the Eldrazi.

**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Leyline of Sanctity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity) to prevent discard and [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil).
