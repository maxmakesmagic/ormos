Welcome back yet again to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings, and boy oh boy, have things changed. When a little thing we like to call the World Championship takes place, you can bet that there will be some big shifts. After all, 20 of the players from the Top 25 Rankings were in attendance for the 2015 World *Magic* Championship in Seattle.


What does this mean for the players who did not compete in last weekend's prestigious tournament? Josh Utter-Leyton, Ben Stark, Matthew Sperling, Andrew Cuneo, and William Jensen have all dropped in ranks. Utter-Leyton? Down six. Stark? Down five. Sperling? Down five. Cuneo? Down four. Jensen? Bye-bye for now.


Then there are the players who, shall we say, had a rough run of things in last weekend's event. Ari Lax has tumbled six ranks as a result of his 2-12 performance, down to No. 13. Shahar Shenhar, the back-to-back World Champion, did *not* have a three-peat last weekend, posting a 4-10 performance and falling two spots to No. 15. Jacob Wilson, Mike Sigrist, and even semifinalist Paul Rietzl all tumbled down by one peg.


However, with a few major drops and some minor moves come several big jumps. While Eric Froehlich remains at the top as No. 1, 2015 World Champion Seth Manfield has moved up two spots to become the No. 2-ranked player in our Top 25. Even bigger jumps occurred for the players that represented Latin America last weekend, as Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa moved up six spots to No. 18, while Thiago Saporito jumps on to the Top 25 rankings on the back of his 8-6 record and eight Pro Points earned.


With the World Championship behind us, our next big weekend for the Top 25 Rankings comes in a few weeks with the next Pro Tour. Until then, we'll keep you posted on any moves in the Top 25 that may occur at the next few Grand Prix stops. Until next week!
