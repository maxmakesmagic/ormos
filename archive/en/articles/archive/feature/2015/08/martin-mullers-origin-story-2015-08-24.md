 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 





Not every *Magic* player at the World Championship has been playing since the beginning. This year's tournament features three players at twenty years old and younger who have proven their skill and knowledge across multiple formats. There's Jacob Wilson, two time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor at twenty years old. Then there's Ondřej Stráský, an emerging force from the Czech Republic who earned two Pro Tour Top 8s last season.


And then there's Martin Müller, this year's youngest competitor at seventeen years old and the prologue of the very prominent rise of Scandinavian players that we have seen since the 2014 World *Magic* Cup. More on that in a moment. Let's start with where it all began.

"My *Magic* story started the classic way," Müller recalled. "I was twelve years old and *Scars of Mirrodin* was just released. I had a friend in school that was trying to convince me to go to this *Magic* store called Fanatic in Roskilde, Denmark. The store I went to was luckily very good at creating a fun environment and hosting tournaments for players under 18 every Friday before FNM. Ever since that day, I was hooked."


While Müller's history in the game is relatively short, he has quickly taken the dive into the deep end of the game. It wasn't long after his first ventures in *Magic* that he started to look towards the Pro Tour.


"In 2013, I had my first chance to qualify for the Pro Tour, where I lost in Round 15 at 12-2 in Grand Prix Warsaw," Müller recollected.  "Prior to this, I did not feel like I had a shot at qualifying. Later that year, I found myself in a *Magic* *Online* PTQ final, but I lost again.  At that point, I began to believe that I had a chance, and the very next week I again found myself in a PTQ final in Denmark. That time, I finally closed the deal, and I was qualified for Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*."


While Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* may have been Müller's first Pro Tour experience, it would be far from his last. Müller finished 17th place at his very first Pro Tour, earning him $2,500 and an invitation to the next one, where he finished 45th and earned $1,500. He continued the streak into Pro Tour *Magic 2015* with a 66th place finish for $1,000 and enough Pro Points to lead Denmark as its team captain…

…which, to say the least, was a pretty reasonable weekend for Müller and his team.


Now, Müller will be one of the four Team Thommo representatives at the World Championship, where he will have his opportunity to add another world-centric trophy to his shelves at home.


*The 2015* Magic: The Gathering *World Championship takes place in Seattle, Washington, during PAX Prime on August 27, 28, and 30.
