*Conflux* Design Feature Article

Ken Nagle was a finalist in the first Great Designer Search and joined Wizards of the Coast as a design intern. He has since gone on to work on twelve Magic expansions, including four of which he led, as well as leading the design of Archenemy and the first Commander decks.
 







Greetings and salutations! Hopefully by now you've gotten a taste of your very own *Conflux* cards. You've cracked them in packs, traded them with friends, absorbed their flavor, and slung them on tables. Today I will relate to you stories about the makings of your *Conflux* cards from inside the hallowed halls of **Magic** R&D.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_prerelease.jpg)### Confluxurationings


As a small expansion, *Conflux* knew its opening act was *Shards of Alara*. That brings to the table these mechanical themes:


 


* Five shards
	+ gWu "Geewoo" Bant – Exalted
	+ wUb "Whub" Esper – Colored Artifacts
	+ uBr "Uber" Grixis – Unearth
	+ bRg "Berg" Jund – Devour
	+ rGw "Ragu" Naya – "5 power matters"
* Three-color gold cards
* Cycling

Block design long before had already determined that *Conflux*'s overarching game-play mechanic would be "five-color gold." Additionally, any small set design team must decide two things: how much of the previous set's themes it will carry, and by how much. For *Conflux*, our answer was "all but less."


The next step was a download from Creative. Mark Rosewater has [mentioned this before](/en/articles/archive/when-worlds-collide-part-i-2009-01-19), but allow me to reiterate the transition from *Shards of Alara* to *Conflux*:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_cross.jpg)In *Shards of Alara*, due to flavor, there is:


 


* No fear. Fear doesn't make flavor sense in *Shards of Alara*.
* Not a single instance of protection.
* No conflict between shards. Conflict is integral to fantasy storytelling, but if you look closely at many *Shards of Alara* illustrations, conflict has been downplayed. We often see the caster but not the target, or vice versa.
	+ The Battlemages are all ready for battle but no shown in battle.
	+ [Swerve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swerve) shows a Grixis mage deflecting a spell to an unknown target. It could have even been his own spell.
	+ [Agony Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp) shows Grixis magic "altering the agony" of Grixis denizens. If this card was in *Eventide*, you can bet there'd be little Kithkins getting pwned in the art.
* No mechanical hosers. "CARDNAME can't be countered" loudly sticks it to countermagic. However, Naya has no idea countermagic even *exists*. Putting all the necessary effort into a spell just to see it fail has never happened in Naya. That's why Naya found out pretty quickly that it's a good idea to make every spell MOAR BIGGER!

As lead designer of Naya, here's a mechanical chart I composed on our internal wiki:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_keywords.jpg)With *Conflux*, the shards can, for the first time, "see" each other. Naya is beginning to overlay Bant and Jund, for example. That's why *Conflux* shows Naya vs. Bant conflicts:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_cross2.jpg)All those "OFF LIMITS" abilities are now fair game for Naya to wage hate-filled war on its new enemies.


### When Shards Collide


The first "layer of hate" is the Outlander cycle:


 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Goblin Outlander
 | 
Vedalken Outlander
 |

Each is a CD 2/2 with protection from its shared enemy color ("CD" is R&D jargon for a cost of two colored mana in allied colors). Printed under different names in *Invasion*, these commons are about as beautifully designed as **Magic** cards can be. They are hate shock troops; they hit the battlefield early and let their hate out!


I suppose a more thematic cycle would be CDE 3/3s with double protection, but game play would suffer since double protection is brutally unfun in three-color and five-color gold world.


Step 2 of Operation Hate is a full uncommon cycle of monocolored cards that hate on their two opposing colors:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_321.jpg)Development likes the effect these kinds of hate cards have on **Magic** as a whole, as Erik Lauer [has elaborated on]. It's a nice treat designers can throw to grumbly developers.


Additionally, design stuffed even more hate into the set! These hate cards are less obvious, but manifest themselves through game play. See if you can figure out who design was hating in these cards:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_JundNayaBantEsper.jpg)Now, if you've been paying attention, you might notice something slightly out of whack. "Why is [Nacatl Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+Savage) a Naya creature that's clearly anti-Esper? I thought Naya is fighting Bant and Jund ...."


Yes, well, design didn't get the memo on exactly which shards were overlapping with which other shards. Not knowing that, the designer instinct is toward **Magic**'s enemy colors like green versus blue. Design inserted [Cumber Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cumber+Stone) and [Nacatl Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+Savage) to show Esper and Naya's hate-hate relationship—foreshadowing what will happen if those two shards do overlap ....


An aside: Esper is especially easy to hate on—just wreck on artifacts.


ROBOTS DIE!!  

 RGW  

 Sorcery  

 Destroy all artifacts. CARDNAME deals X damage to target player and you gain X life, where X is the number of artifacts destroyed this way.


Poor Esper! We had to pull back on the vindictive Esper hate.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_esper.jpg)### Mana-Fixing


Part of the craziness of a five-color theme is fitting enough mana-fixing into the set. We found a few different ways to do that.


**Colorless Cycling**


This at minimum costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif) (at ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) the mechanic becomes a strange cog for threshold or dredge). *Shards of Alara* does this, notably on [Jungle Weaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Weaver) and [Viscera Dragger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Dragger).


*Scourge* had good success with its mechanic called "[Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)cycling" on [Chartooth Cougar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chartooth+Cougar). We tried these and discovered we wanted more versatility in a five-color world. We needed more than five common mana-fixing slots, too.


With Domain decided as our five-color mechanic, we invented a new mana-fixing keyword ability and spread it onto some common spells.


**Basic Landcycling**


 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Traumatic Visions
 | 
Fiery Fall
 |

This way is pretty sweet because we get away with putting it on a blue card even though we would never print this card in a vacuum:



> 
> Blue Wanderer's Twig  
> 
>  1U  
> 
>  Instant  
> 
>  Search your library for a basic land card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.
> 
> 
> 


I call these cards the "[Wanderer's Twig](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wanderer%27s+Twig)s." We essentially needed to discreetly hide five [Wanderer's Twig](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wanderer%27s+Twig)s in common slots. Putting a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif) on these turns them into colorless instants, and players might miss that for mana-fixing purposes, they should be playing a black card even with no black mana sources in their deck. We liked 1C the best.



### *Conflux* Playtest Names Minigame


Match the playtest name to the printed card name. (Mouse over the names to see the answers!)




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Two-Punch Steve](#minigame1)[Delicious Food](#minigame1)[Little Tulip](#minigame1)[Espermaru](#minigame1)[Mosstodon](#minigame1)[Surprise Watkins](#minigame1)[The Erik Lauer Experience](#minigame1) | 

Magister Sphinx




Tukatongue Thallid




Valiant Guard




Court Homunculus




Beacon Behemoth




Gluttonous Slime




Knight of the Reliquary

 |

I'm oversimplifying the process here, but more artifact and land mana-fixers found their way into the set mostly during development: [Mana Cylix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Cylix), [Kaleidostone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaleidostone), [Armillary Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armillary+Sphere), [Rupture Spire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rupture+Spire), and [Unstable Frontier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Frontier).


Design initially gave each color its own mana-fixing common: the not-all-intended-to-see-print list of [Helionaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helionaut), [Grixis Illusionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis+Illusionist), [Vesper Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesper+Ghoul), [Wild Cantor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Cantor), and [Quirion Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Elves).


 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Helionaut
 | 
Vesper Ghoul
 |

Of these, only two remain: [Grixis Illusionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis+Illusionist) and ....



![Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Noble+Hierarch)

  

 ... [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), which, as Tom LaPille [explained on Friday](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/tales-future-future-past-2009-02-06), began life as a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) 1/1 common that tapped for any color of mana.


**Mike Turian, *Conflux* Lead Developer**![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_miketurian.jpg)My favorite *Conflux* card is [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). I have always loved [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), and I think that [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) really hits what I love about [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) while also standing out as a Bant creature. I remember coming in one morning and throwing out the idea that the Hierarch would only tap for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif), or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif). It was the perfect match for the card.


### Five-Color Gold


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_gold.jpg)The design team knew there would be ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)-costed cards in the set.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_322.jpg)You wouldn't know it, but development was constantly trying to beat up on [Fusion Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fusion+Elemental)'s power and toughness.


**Mark Globus, *Conflux* Designer**![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_markglobus.jpg)One of my favorite things about *Conflux* design was successfully defending [Fusion Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fusion+Elemental) from development trying to make it smaller than 8/8. I was also happy to see my design for [Maelstrom Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Archangel) made it to print and is popular.


However, ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) is the apex of mana costs, the zenith of a plan to acquire the power of all colors. It's not "piecemeal" enough to sprinkle throughout the set. We knew we needed five-color cards that weren't defined by sticking ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) in their mana costs, so we went in a few different directions.


The first of these was ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) activations. These are cards that you can play early in a single color to fight for you. Later in the game when you've assembled all five colors, your creature can hulk out by drinking delicious ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) juice.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_four.jpg)**Bill Rose, *Conflux* Lead Designer**![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_billrose.jpg)  

 Choosing my favorite card is always difficult for me. I love all my babies—well, at least many of them. If I must choose one it's [Dragonsoul Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonsoul+Knight). [Dragonsoul Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonsoul+Knight) and its brethren—[Paragon of the Amesha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon+of+the+Amesha), [Fleshformer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshformer), and [Worldheart Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldheart+Phoenix)—were designed midway through the design process. I think they made the set gel. These cards have an awesome combination of flavor, playability, and late game power. I enjoy playing a three-color, five-color deck. I focus on one shard then add quasi five-color cards like [Dragonsoul Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonsoul+Knight) and Domain cards. My favorite *Shards* / *Conflux* Limited deck is a Naya deck featuring [Dragonsoul Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonsoul+Knight) and [Paragon of the Amesha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon+of+the+Amesha).


Meanwhile, a Mark Gottlieb cycle of C-drop CDE and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) activation enchantments all coalesced into the numerically poetic ultimate Obelisk.



![Obelisk of Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Obelisk+of+Alara)

  

 Finally, there's Domain. Mark Rosewater already [wrote seventy trillion words about the origin of Domain](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/tales-future-future-past-2009-02-06). I was the #1 supporter of Domain, having played with it back in *Invasion*, as my single casual deck on my **Magic Online** account, and all during *Conflux*-capable FFL. It's budget-friendly, infinitely customizable, castable even in mono-color, scalable with the game time, and most importantly, fun. It even wins money in Extended! We brought back some oldies that were goodies ([Worldly Counsel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Counsel) and [Might of Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Alara), a functional reprint of Gaea's Might) ...

... and some newbies ([Aven Trailblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Trailblazer), [Matca Rioters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matca+Rioters), [Wandering Goblins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wandering+Goblins), [Drag Down](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drag+Down), [Voices from the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voices+from+the+Void), [Spore Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spore+Burst), [Manaforce Mace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaforce+Mace), and [Exploding Borders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploding+Borders)).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_three2.jpg)I would count [Armillary Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armillary+Sphere), [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), [Unstable Frontier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Frontier), [Grixis Illusionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grixis+Illusionist), and basic landcycling cards as Domain enablers, too.


### Wait, We Forgot About *Shards of Alara*!


The design team made sure to give what card slots we could to exalted, devour, and friends from *Shards of Alara*. We ended high on unearth on purpose because we knew we were heralding the return of ...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_bolas.jpg)... [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nicol%2BBolas%252C%2BPlaneswalker)!


We knew Grixis players were starved from *Shards of Alara*, with the shard missing its planeswalker and unearth trailing as an unloved mechanic in some eyes. *Conflux* delivers [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker) and high octane to the unearth gas tank.

Naya's 5-power theme went "explosive X," a mechanic I included in the original Naya design handoff from *Shards of Alara* that was pushed off until *Conflux*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/25_three3.jpg)### Three-Color Gold


We hit the *Shards of Alara* three-color gold theme, no strings, with an uncommon cycle ([Skyward Eye Prophets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyward+Eye+Prophets), [Sludge Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sludge+Strider), [Elder Mastery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Mastery), [Scarland Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarland+Thrinax), and [Knotvine Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knotvine+Mystic)) and a rare cycle ([Giltspire Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giltspire+Avenger), [Magister Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magister+Sphinx), [Blood Tyrant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Tyrant), [Charnelhoard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charnelhoard+Wurm), and [Meglonoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meglonoth)).


We also explored "colored permanents matter." We did this mechanic as recently as Shadowmoor and Eventide:


 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Whimwader
 | 
Sedraxis Alchemist
 |

Where *Shadowmoor* and *Eventide* made blue cards that like blue things, *Conflux* put the color-matters effect on its ally color card to lean heavier on "gold-matters" than "hybrid-matters." These are sprinkled throughout the set on creatures and instants such as [Dark Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Temper) and [Parasitic Strix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parasitic+Strix).


 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Bloodhall Ooze
 | 
Mirror-Sigil Sergeant
 |

This mechanic, incidentally, allows us to create "one-drop gold creatures" like [Bloodhall Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodhall+Ooze) and [Kederekt Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kederekt+Parasite). These creatures drew inspiration from [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl), which itself drew inspiration from [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape).


We consider it bonus inter-block synergy, that, for example, [Bloodhall Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodhall+Ooze) loves being near a [Rendclaw Trow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rendclaw+Trow) or a [Worm Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worm+Harvest) token.


We also did a few off-color activations at common, on cards such as [Darklit Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darklit+Gargoyle), [Pestilent Kathari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilent+Kathari), and [Kranioceros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kranioceros).


Finally, there was a full-blown uncommon cycle of "CE" activations for better upside:

### Guess the *Conflux* Card by its R&D Comments Minigame


[MV text]  

 MT 12/17: Awesome. Maybe cost more and be just opponents.  

 BR 12/18: All players so you can discard a DoD creature.  

 KEN 1/2/2008: This guy, the 2/1, and the Tom are my favorite DotD guys.  

 MP 2/11: Feels reasonably close to the ROC DOTD discard guy. 1B to make them discard 1 more.  

 BR 2/25: design and development happy with this card.  

 AF 3/10: If the above comment is supposed to mean "protection from changes," ha. That said, this one is fine.  

 Del 4/3: New unearth functionality. Only 6 unearth cards in this set.  

 MT 4/4: 4% of the set is unearth!  

 DAL 4/11: Fun guy. Might certainly be constructed playable if you have stuff you want to discard.  

 TML 8/12: I don't think we should spend the name "Zombie Rats" here. We should use that name on a card that is promotable, not one that is isolated by a block mechanic.  

 KEN 5/9: Strong card. Just a couple of these guarantees putting the game into topdecks mode, and they make topdecking reactive cards worse ([Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)).  

 GM 7/2: Can these be zombie rats? [Death Baron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Baron) would like to play with them.  

 DB 7/8/08: Zombifying... pending Brady's okay.  

 Grave Baron 07/08/08: ty

![Rotting Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rotting+Rats)

  

 "DoD" and "DotD" are abbreviations for "[Dawn of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+of+the+Dead)," the playtest name for unearth. "ROC" is short for "Rock," *Shards of Alara*'s codename.

>  Del 4/22: Ignore previous comments. I forgot how Magic works.
