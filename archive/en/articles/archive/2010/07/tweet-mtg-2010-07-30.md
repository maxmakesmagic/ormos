Twitter is a pretty chaotic place, with millions of users, billions of tweets, and conversations, memes, and trending topics appearing and vanishing in minutes. What if you could bring some of that chaos to your casual **Magic** game? This weekend, we're going to find out.


It's called TweetMTG, and it's happening all this weekend on the @[TweetMTG](https://twitter.com/tweetmtg) Twitter feed. You can check out the [complete rules](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/daily/events/tweetmtg2010rules) for more, but here's a last-minute recap:


* Get some friends together.
* Make sure they each have a Magic deck. (If they don't, you can visit one of the many locations that sell Magic! Don’t worry, we’ll wait. We have all weekend.)
* Join the team of one of the Magic 2011 Planeswalkers: Ajani, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, or Garruk
* Tune in to TweetMTG's Twitter channel.
* Play as normal. The tweets will add randomness to the game every few minutes.
* Play again and again, because as soon as it hits July 31 anywhere on the planet, the feed begins and doesn't stop until the final seconds of August 1. That's three days of game play! For you time-zone challenged, here's some help:
	+ UTC: Starts at noon on July 30, ends at 11:59 a.m. on August 2
	+ New York City: Starts at 8 a.m. on July 30, ends at 7:59 a.m. on August 2
	+ Moscow: Starts at 4 p.m. on July 30, ends at 3:59 p.m. on August 2
	+ Sydney: Starts 10 p.m. on July 30, ends at 9:59 p.m. on August 2

That's all it takes to get in on the action. And if you've got any fun stories from your Tweet MTG games, we'd love to hear them—where else?—on Twitter!
