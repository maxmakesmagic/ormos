In light of this weekend's Pro Tour in Nice, France, we dredged up this blast from the past. Below is the front and back of the postcard that was mailed to **Magic** players announcing the very first Professional Tournament. The tournament took place in February 1996.

  
  
Quite a few things about the Pro Tour have changed since then. Back then, there were no qualifier tournaments -- you simply registered over the phone, first-come-first-serve! There was an entry fee, which no longer exists, and the total purse back then -- $30,000 -- is now the amount of money given out to first place alone.


Donâ€™t forget to follow the real Pro Tour on the [Sideboard](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/3rd4th-place-playoff-rob-nadebaum-vs-daniel-clifton-2015-07-22) this weekend!
