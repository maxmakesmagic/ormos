 As I was a few weeks ahead thanks to the podcast's slow start, I decided to put out a new podcast each week during the break. That means if you're not following me on social media (and if not, you really should give it a try—[Twitter](https://twitter.com/maro254), [Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/107824009487778543249/posts)) or iTunes, there are three weeks of podcasts to catch up on. 


 My favorite article from 2011 was [a two-parter](/en/node/654461) based on an "Intro to Game Design" speech I gave to my daughter's fifth grade class. For this week's podcast, I decided to revisit that article and talk about the topic a little more in depth. If you are at all interested in basic game design, I urge you to give it a listen.

 This week's "Drive to Work" podcast is the first one I recorded after the podcast began airing. I decided to talk about the set I got the most requests for—*Time Spiral*. The set is very divisive (loved by some and hated by others) so it seemed like an awesome topic for the podcast.
