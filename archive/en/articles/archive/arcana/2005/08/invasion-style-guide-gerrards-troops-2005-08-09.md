Today we take a look at *Invasion's* style guide. A style guide is a series of reference illustrations and text given to the artists that worked on the set. 

In the *Invasion* storyline, when [Tsabo Tavoc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo+Tavoc) leads the Phyrexian army into Benalia, [Gerrard Capashen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard+Capashen) collects a prison full of criminals and renegades to come to Benalia's aid.

These ramshackle troops are as jury-rigged and improvised as they come. Here are some great images by Todd Lockwood representing what these troops might look like.
