Welcome to Arch Enemy Week! I'm not sure why we're dedicating an entire week to talking about Mark Gottlieb, but ... oh, it's *Archenemy* Week. We're dedicating the week to talk about our latest product release, *Archenemy*, a multiplayer format where many players take on one. That makes a lot more sense. Well, I guess I'll have to leave the shocking stories and incriminating photos for another column.
