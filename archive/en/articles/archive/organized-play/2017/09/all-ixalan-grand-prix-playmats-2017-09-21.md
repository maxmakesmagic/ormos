Today's article is pretty self-explanatory. I have a lot of Grand Prix playmats to show off, along with details of how you can get them! But before we dive into that . . .


The *Ixalan* Grand Prix T-Shirt
===============================


Starting with the Grand Prix at the end of this month and running through Grand Prix Santa Clara (the first GP of 2018), players will find a T-shirt on prize walls featuring some *dinolightful* artwork.

Yes, I just used the word "dinolightful" to describe something with dinos as delightful.


(Yes, I have regrets.)


Either way, this shirt design is sweet, and you'll find the shirts at Grand Prix for the next few months. Grab one while you can!


The Playmats!
=============


Okay, here we go.


**Shizuoka and Providence**


The Team Limited Grand Prix in Shizuoka and Providence start things off September 29 through October 1 with a huge hurrah for the *Ixalan* Release Weekend, as the trios that compete in the main event will receive three *double-sided* playmats featuring art from three of *Ixalan*'s double-faced cards: [Search for Azcanta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta) (art by [Magali Villeneuve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5b%22Magali%20Villeneuve%22%5d)), [Growing Rites of Itlimoc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Growing+Rites+of+Itlimoc) (art by [Grzegorz Rutkowski](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5b%22Grzegorz%20Rutkowski%22%5d)), and [Arguel's Blood Fast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arguel%27s+Blood+Fast) (art by [Daarken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5b%22Daarken%22%5d)).


We're showcasing two sides of three different playmats, so to keep you from scrolling through too many playmats one after another, we're posting the Providence playmats to show them off. Shizuoka's playmats will, of course, have the Grand Prix Shizuoka logo in the place of the Providence logo.

Shizuoka main event teams will get one of each of the three playmats. Providence teams that registered prior to September 1 will also receive one of each of the three playmats, but additional registration packages—including some side event packages—offer playmats, so refer to the [GP Providence website](http://www.mtggp.com/gpprovidence) for more info.


**Hong Kong, Liverpool, and Phoenix**


After a few weeks on hiatus for the 2017 World Championship, the last weekend of Nationals, and Eternal Weekend in North America, the Grand Prix circuit returns with Limited GPs in Hong Kong, Liverpool, and Phoenix October 27–29.


The weekend-exclusive playmat for these three GP main events is [Daring Saboteur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daring+Saboteur), with artwork from [Victor Adame Minguez](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5b%22Victor%20Adame%20Minguez%22%5d).

Liverpool competitors can get the playmat by registering for the main event by September 30 or by signing up through other registration options. Finally, the Phoenix playmat is available through a variety of registration packages for either the main event or various side events, as well as through the prize wall (while supplies last).


**Shanghai, Warsaw, and Atlanta**


Following Pro Tour *Ixalan* is another triple-header, with Standard GP main events in Shanghai, Warsaw, and Atlanta November 10–12.
