Wizards of the Coast is proud to have partnered with Extra Life since 2015, and last year we were named [Extra Life Partner of the Year for 2020](https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/wizards-of-the-coast-named-extra-life-partner-of-the-year/) when we raised over $1.6 million for local Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

This year, we're back again to raise even more with the *Magic* community for Extra Life 2021! With a live streaming event on November 6, team-ups with fan-favorite destinations such as MTG Pro Shop, and your help by joining the Wizards of the Coast fundraising team, we can reach even higher to support Seattle Children's Hospital.


The Stream
==========


You can watch our annual Extra Life charity stream on Saturday, November 6, beginning at 4 p.m. PT at [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). This year, we have even more exciting *Magic* for you to watch—and to join in shaping with your donations:


* Q&A with Mark Rosewater, hosted by Sara Harless
* Flavorful stakes with Ironroot Chef, this time on *MTG Arena*, featuring Gavin Verhey, Aaron Forsythe, Melissa DeTora, and more
* A *Vintage Cube* draft on *Magic Online*—with draft stipulations of course—featuring Mike Turian, David McDarby, Emma Handy, and more
* Set Booster minigames played out through SpellTable, with Daniel Holt, Jim Baker, Lauren Bond, and more

Join in the fun and donate to make things even more exciting for the *Wizards* participants and fans watching!


The Gear
========


From *MTG Arena* to your tabletop games and beyond, there are even more ways to show your support with net proceeds donated to Extra Life and benefiting Seattle Children's Hospital.
