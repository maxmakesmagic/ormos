The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 3, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by countdowns. 5...4...3...2...


Today's Must
============


1. [Excerpt #4: On China](http://writtenbyjames.com/2016/03/02/magic-the-addiction-excerpt-4-on-china/) | "Magic: The Addiction" | James Hsu

Here's something a bit different. James Hsu says he is publishing a book about his time spent playing *Magic* over the past 20 years, and he's published [four excerpts from the book on his website](http://writtenbyjames.com/). The fourth one is all about his experience playing in China, and it's pretty telling about the differences in culture that are nonetheless bridged by our little card game. Very cool read.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. Everyone talks about [Hardened Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales)

Let's see, today is Thursday, which means it's exactly the right time of the week for publishing schedules to dive deep on the previous weekend—and the previous weekend was all about Standard and [Hardened Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) at Grand Prix Houston. Want to read about or watch videos of the Green-White [Hardened Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) deck? Here are some options:


* [Newly crowned No. 2 Player in the World Paulo Vitro Damo Da Rosa takes an in-depth look at the archetype.](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/an-in-depth-look-at-gw-hardened-scales/)
* [Andrea Mengucci tests the deck out on *Magic Online*.](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-mengucci-standard-hardened-scales/)
* [Ross Merriam discusses when to switch in the face of a new contender like Hardened Scales](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32506_This-Deck-Is-Busted.html).
* StarCityGames.com Premium (Warning: um, premium, paid content) has two offerings, [a video from Todd Anderson](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32510_Video-Hardened-Scales-In-Standard.html) and a [deck primer from Brad Nelson](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32505_Hardened-Scales-In-Houston.html).

And, of course, you can read all about the deck's breakout weekend on the [Grand Prix Houston coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gphou16).


1. [Against the Odds: Psychogenic Probe](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-psychogenic-probe) | MTGGoldfish | Saffron Olive

Ever wanted to punish your opponent just for the act of shuffling? And then want to punish them some more by forcing them to shuffle a bunch—with a side of pain? Saffron finds out what that world is like with a Modern [Psychogenic Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychogenic+Probe) list sure to cause headaches for your opponent.


1. [Werewolf Planeswalker: Arlinn Kord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJE0fQqo4lY) | Seibenlore

Well that was fast. Yesterday, we revealed [a werewolf Planeswalker, Arlinn Kord](http://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/arlinn-kord). Today, Seibenlore has a video up about it. That's quite the turnaround.

A whole lot of people clicked that very button on *Magic Online* when Sealed Leagues were finally open to the public just yesterday. So many, in fact, that the League cap was raised from 2,000 up to 3,000, and, as of this writing, there were 2,611 active players in the League. You can learn more about [Sealed Leagues here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/waiting-hardest-part-2016-02-24), or just turn and ask the player closest to you. By this point, chances are good they've joined.

Amidst the talk of OH MY GOSH, A WEREWOLF PLANESWALKER yesterday, people took note of Hal and Alena as well. Just figured I'd make sure everyone saw Kimberly Kreines (the author of [the story](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/under-silver-moon-2016-03-02)) give the official answer on Twitter.

Including this because no tweet has made me laugh this much this early in the morning. Or maybe it's because I'm half-awake that these GIFs made me giggle. Either way, Gaby Spartz's stream hosted a discussion of the best *Magic*-related GIFs last night, and Luis Scott-Vargas got pretty close to the best. In order:


* [Team United States loses to a topdecked Bonfire of the Damned, knocking them out of the first World *Magic* Cup.](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8032/7978765409_43cab37687_o.gif)

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) shifts back

[Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) has not been a terribly popular deck lately, but that might have been because the old version—a three-color version that went deep on blue for cards such as [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)—was pretty bad at playing a fast enough game to keep up with the Eldrazi. Which makes sense—the deck was meant to be a slow combo deck that could protect itself until it won with a single spell.


These days, who has that kind of time? Might as well go as fast as possible to seven lands, cast [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift), and win, right? Charmed\_Life's version drops blue for more acceleration, including the double-acceleration of [Khalni Heart Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition). You know speed is the key when [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and [Farseek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) are only worth two slots apiece. This deck benefits greatly from Eldrazi's inability to interact with it ([Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) is as close as that deck gets, and it's mostly set to one, which touches very little in this deck) and the general pushing out of counter magic in the format, making [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)s without protection far more viable.


Will we see more of this deck in [Detroit](http://magic.wizards.com/en/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpdet16)? Maybe in [Melbourne](http://magic.wizards.com/en/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmel16)? Could it blossom in [Bologna](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpbol16)? We'll find out this weekend!
