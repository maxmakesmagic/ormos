**Card of the Day - jeudi 30 juin 2005**

 *Urza’s Saga* uncommon. Though Urza block was often referred to as the artifact block, this wasn’t the original intention. *Urza’s Saga* is actually centered on an enchantment theme, but this was overshadowed by the storyline of the artifact cycle as well as the presence of many influential artifacts, such as Fluctuator. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 29 juin 2005**

 *Legions* common. One of the ways **Magic** stays fresh is by completely surprising the players from time to time. Many didn’t believe it when rumors first started that the *Legions* set was 100% creatures. Despite such a drastic difference, the set plays quite a bit like other sets thanks to cards like this, which have a very non-creature, spell-like feel to them when flipped. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 28 juin 2005**

 *Mercadian Masques* rare. When white was determined to be the color that sets rules for how the game is played, R&D went back through **Magic**’s history looking for previous cards that set rules, but which hadn’t been white. Crackdown is a white version of Meekstone (an artifact). Because of the change, Meekstone hasn’t shown up in the core set since *Seventh Edition*. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 27 juin 2005**

 *Judgment* uncommon. This choosing drawback was called the punisher mechanic during design. The idea was to explore new ways to play off the unpredictable aspects of red. By giving the opponent the choice of which event occurs, red mages gain the ability to achieve somewhat off-color effects essentially by threatening their opponent with something very on-color – direct damage. 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 24 juin 2005**

 *Fallen Empires* common. This card got its name because the designers thought it would be funny to hear people describe denizens of Leitbur as “Leitburites” which sounds an awful lot like “LiteBrites”. Perhaps they knew some day the company would be bought up by Hasbro?


**Card of the Day - jeudi 23 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222640im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pygmy%20Allosaurus)#### Pygmy Allosaurus


 *Ice Age* rare. This little guy is the only tournament-legal dinosaur ever printed (insert Mistform Ultimus exception clause here)!


**Card of the Day - mercredi 22 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222623im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Ranger)#### Quirion Ranger


 *Visions* common. Printed with the intention of keeping Stasis decks in check, Quirion Ranger went on to do much more. Picking up lands turned out to be quite good for many reasons. Combine that with the ability to untap creatures such as Tradewind Rider and you can see why the Ranger became a central card in so many decks.


**Card of the Day - mardi 21 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200114025343im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Revenant)#### Revenant


 *Stronghold* rare. The flavor text on this card is a joking reference to the flavor text on Lhurgoyf. That this *Tempest* block card refers to an *Ice Age* card's flavor text makes it quite rare, spanning both a large amount of time as well as two different planes. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 20 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190613211812im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sakashima%20the%20Impostor)#### Sakashima the Impostor


 *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. During the design phase of *Saviors* there were so many cool legends that the designers wanted a way to clone them. This card was designed to answer the problem of "how do you clone a legend without killing it due to the legend rule?" 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 17 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222733im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cranial%20Extraction)#### Cranial Extraction


 *Champions of Kamigawa* rare. This card was inspired by trying to find a way to make a tournament-legal version of the *Unglued* card Look at Me, I'm the DCI.


**Card of the Day - jeudi 16 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190613231959im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rend%20Flesh)#### Rend Flesh


 *Champions of Kamigawa* common. While many cards were made Arcane for mechanic-based reasons, this one was strictly due to flavor. (It's hard to get more Arcane than only killing non-spirits!)


**Card of the Day - mercredi 15 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222800im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Glacial%20Ray)#### Glacial Ray


 *Champions of Kamigawa* common. The splice mechanic went through many different incarnations during design playtesting. The first card designed for the version of splice you see today (called “Piggyback” during design) was Glacial Ray, which Mark Rosewater used to demonstrate the proposed mechanic to the rest of the team. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 14 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222611im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gaze%20of%20Adamaro)#### Gaze of Adamaro


 *Saviors of Kamigawa* uncommon. While the Maro series of creatures is named after Mark Rosewater, it's complete coincidence that this one's name starts with “Adam” – the name of Mark Rosewater's son. That's what he says anyway. If Wizards ever prints a card called “Rachelmaro” you'll know differently. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 13 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161113174306im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Evermind)#### Evermind


 *Saviors of Kamigawa* uncommon. The second card ever printed without a mana cost, Evermind is the first time it was actually done on purpose. 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 10 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222615im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Path%20of%20Anger's%20Flame)#### Path of Anger's Flame


 *Saviors of Kamigawa* common. While finishing up the set's initial design roster nobody could come to agreement on the last card. When this one was considered someone said: “Tyler would like to eat now.” The card made it onto the roster, and R&D member Tyler Bielman was not-so-immortalized by its playtest name: “Tyler Would Like to Eat Now.” 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 9 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190628022425im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ideas%20Unbound)#### Ideas Unbound


 *Saviors of Kamigawa* common. This card had been in the design files for years, but never managed to make it into a set. It finally got its shot with *Saviors* because it interacted so well with the set’s wisdom (“Hand Size Matters”) mechanic. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 8 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222619im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Iname%20as%20One)#### Iname as One


 *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. This card is more a combination of Iname, Death Aspect and Iname, Life Aspect than some players may realize. The casting cost, power, and toughness of Iname as One are all exactly the sum of the attributes from the two previous cards. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 7 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190613223424im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Twincast)#### Twincast


 *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. R&D had actually decided six or seven years ago that Fork would make sense in blue. Versions of this card were submitted for many sets over the years, but it wasn’t until *Saviors* that “the blue Fork” got its shot at the big time. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 6 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222725im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Choice%20of%20Damnations)#### Choice of Damnations


 *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. During design this card (at a different cost) was actually a 5/6 monster as well. During testing the effect was so popular that the creature part felt like a distraction and was dropped so that the card could be costed lower. 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 3 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222808im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Memory%20Lapse)#### Memory Lapse


 *Mirage* common. This card was actually designed for *Mirage* as part of a cycle of cards that were the opposite of cantrips. Rather than you drawing an extra card, your opponent ended up with one less card. The card was moved to *Homelands* to fill an empty slot. Examples of the reverse-cantrip cycle that did make it to *Mirage* are Disempower, Fallow Earth, Ether Well, and Painful Memories. 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 2 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222712im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ancestral%20Memories)#### Ancestral Memories


 *Mirage* rare. Ancestral Recall, one of the most powerful cards ever printed, was actually named Ancestral Memories during the design of Alpha. The *Mirage* card’s name was a reference to that original Alpha playtest name. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 1 juin 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20121111222636im_/http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Memory%20Crystal)#### Memory Crystal


 *Exodus* rare. This card was originally slated for the *Tempest* set. However, that put it in the same set as the Medallion cycle. Because their effects felt somewhat similar, Memory Crystal was moved to the third set to give it some space from the medallions.
