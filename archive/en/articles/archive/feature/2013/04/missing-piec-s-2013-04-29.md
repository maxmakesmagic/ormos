She has a very nerdy sense of humor. (Someday, her illustrated mutant amalgamations shall take over the Multiverse! Patience, my pet. Patience.....) 






 
We have a bit of a challenge for you... Can you figure out what's missing from these card images?

The Golgari save and reuse pretty much *everything*. While they seem to know how to get all their "resources" without any mishaps, we're not all so lucky. What's missing from this sewer?

The Simic are concerned. Their experiments have been going missing lately. Only... they don't want to ask around, because it's possible they're not being stolen, but walking away on their own. Like this one that they've lost the documentation on. What's missing from the test chamber?
