When deciding the art to feature on expansion booster packs, the **Magic** art director selects works that can visually represent the new environment of the set as well as considering iconic characters or key cards tied to new mechanics.

**Fist of Suns by Arnie Swekel**  


**Bringer of the Red Dawn by Christopher Moeller**  


**Etched Oracle by Matt Cavotta**
