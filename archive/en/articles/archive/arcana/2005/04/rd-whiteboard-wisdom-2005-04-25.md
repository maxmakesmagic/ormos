Inside the Wizards of the Coast offices, in a hallway near the department known as **Magic** R&D, there's a whiteboard. On this whiteboard, deep questions are posed and then answered by passersby and their multicolored, dry-erase wisdom. In the past, for example, this whiteboard sought answers to the question, "[Is gum food?](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/faq/unhinged)" 

Here's a photo of the R&D whiteboard's current question: "What is the lamest superpower you can think of?"

  
*Stare into the wisdom.*
