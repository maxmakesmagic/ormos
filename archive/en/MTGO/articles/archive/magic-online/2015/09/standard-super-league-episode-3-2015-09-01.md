It is win-and-in time tonight on Standard Super League! While two spots in the playoffs have already been clinched (by Gaby Spartz and Josh Utter-Leyton), the schedule for this last week of Group Stage matches has worked out such that all the 1-1 players are paired up against each other. That means we have fully *four* win-and-in matches tonight:

Watch [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) tonight, September 1 at 6:00 p.m. PT (UTC-7) for the newest episode of the Standard Super League!


Standard Super League decklists can be found [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/standard-super-league-season-2-decklists).

Gaby and Josh still have plenty to play for as well, since the two best group winners will get byes in the six-player single-elimination playoff bracket. Each of them can clinch a bye with a win tonightâ€”but if either of them loses, then tiebreakers could get a bit messy as we sort through the 2-1 players.


Since the Top 4 finishers qualify for the Super League Championship, a playoff bye also advances a player directly into the fall tournament as well. So there's lots of the line tonight, and it should be a great show!
