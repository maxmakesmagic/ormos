### November 30, 2004


**Q:** "I was wondering if the man in the artwork for [Recoup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoup) was [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kamahl%252C%2BPit%2BFighter) with long black hair or is the guy just wearing Kamahl's armor?"  

--Ron  

Georgetown, IL, USA


**A:** From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** R&D:


"No, Ron, that's not [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kamahl%252C%2BPit%2BFighter). But like Kamahl, the figure shown is a barbarian warrior from the Pardic Mountains, which is why the armor is similiar. You can also see that characteristic Pardic armor on [Break Open](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Break+Open), [Sandskin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandskin), [Grand Melee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Melee), [Barbarian Bully](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Bully), [Crazed Firecat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crazed+Firecat), [Hell-Bent Raider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell-Bent+Raider), [Halberdier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halberdier), [Spellgorger Barbarian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellgorger+Barbarian), [Undead Gladiator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Gladiator), [Infectious Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infectious+Rage), [Toxic Stench](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toxic+Stench), [Barbarian Lunatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic), and [Crackling Club](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Club)."

**Q:** "How do you choose which card will be the prerelease card?"  

--Bob  

Ontario, Canada


**A:** From **Brian Schneider**, **Magic** R&D:


"We like to find something that looks 'cool' to most audiences, a card that showcases our new mechanics or helps support the new theme or flavor of the new world. We often choose creatures. The [Kaldra cycle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=kaldra&fields=%7Cname&format=Allsets&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1), I believe, was the first time we didn't."


  
### November 26, 2004


**Q:** "Has R&D ever just decided to make a card simply because it would be able to destroy a certain deck? Looking at [Imi Statue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imi+Statue), it seems custom-built to greatly hinder the popular 'Affinity' archetype and feels a bit out of place in *Champions*."  

-- Zach


**A:** From **Aaron Forsythe**, **Magic** R&D:


"Have we ever? Yes. The most notable in recent memory was [Tsabo's Decree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Decree), which was made to stop *Mercadian Masques* block [Rebel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=rebel&fields=%7Ctype&format=Allsets&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) decks. We don't like to make cards like this, as they tend to feel a little forced, and they call attention to our past mistakes while trying to compensate for them.


"[Tsabo's Web](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Web) is another card from the *Invasion* block that was made to defuse a problem from *Masques*--[Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port). But the Web was made to counteract a specific card, not a deck. At the other end of the spectrum are cards like [Imi Statue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imi+Statue) and [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), which were made to help fight against an entire block. With *Mirrodin* potentially filling constrcuted with artifact-heavy decks and dedicated combo decks (like [Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Krark-Clan%2BIronworks)), we wanted to have good countermeasures available regardless of what the actual decks looked like.


"Development is always looking to shore up weaknesses in the metagame by making cards that are good against dominant strategies, but we generally try to hide them. For more examples, check out my article '[Top Ten Cards from Development](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/af38).'"

**Q:** "I’ve seen writers on the site use the term flagbearer a few times, and I was wondering what a 'flagbearer' is?"  

-- Blaine  

California


**A:** From **Matt Place**, **Magic** R&D:


"'[Flagbearer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=flagbearer&fields=%7Cname%7Crules%7Ctype&format=Allsets&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1)' refers to a fun creature type and mechanic from *Apocalypse*. When you have a flagbearer in play, your opponent is forced to target a Flagbearer with all of their spells or abilities they play. So, when you have a 'Flagbearer' your other creatures feel pretty safe. In addition to protecting your other creatures from harm, Flagbearers were great against your opponent’s beneficial spells and abilities. Your opponent isn’t happy to see your Flagbearer when his hand contains cards like [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak), [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) or [Samite Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite+Healer).


"This creature type is a lot of fun to play with, especially when you are also using cards like [Regeneration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regeneration) to help keep them in play."


  
### November 24, 2004


**Q:** "The [Wyluli Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wyluli+Wolf) Card of the Day blurb mentioned that it changed rarity from common to rare. What are some other cards that have changed rarity?"  

--Jeff, Maryland, USA


**A:** From **Devin Low**, **Magic** R&D:


"Hi Jeff,


"Doing a comprehensive list of the rarity changes sounded boring to research and boring to read, so let me instead give you some of the reasons behind these changes. One of the better known examples is that [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane) was uncommon up through *Fifth Edition* and became rare in *Sixth* and *Seventh Edition*. There are many many reasons for the change:


* A green spell that can do X damage straight to an opponent’s head is weird enough in the flavor of green that it should be rare. This is probably the main reason.
* These days, we try to keep most spells that can do X damage to an opponent at high rarities, to decrease the frequency of people getting “[Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)ed out” in limited games. In the good old days of 1993, [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) and [Disintegrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disintegrate) meant there were not only one common red X spell that could hit players but two commons! Creature stalemates were more frequent then, and the stalemates often ended with a [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) for 8 to the head. So often, in fact, that it became a little predictable and annoying. I prefer sealed deck games where red X spells that can hit players come up less frequently, and creatures do most of the work.
* The perfect mirror to the red rare [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake), [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane) was made to match it in rarity as well.
* Spells that can kill several large creatures at once are usually rare because they have such potentially sweeping, powerful effects.

"Other rarity changes include [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) going from common in *Fifth Edition* to uncommon in *Sixth Edition*, for many of the same reasons as [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane). [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) at common in *Urza’s Saga* limited wreaked an awful lot of havoc, helping make Mono-Black the best deck in the format. [Power Sink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Sink) went from Common to Uncommon for its complexity.


"When I first saw [River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa) in *Visions* I thought 'Wow, 2 mana creatures like [Drudge Skeletons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons) usually have one ability. If you count the extra point of power, this 2 mana guy has three abilities!' That extra complexity is why he moved up from common to uncommon.


"Finally, in *Seventh Edition* limited, every other pack seem to have a [circle of protection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=circle_of_protection&fields=%7Cname%7Crules%7Ctype&format=EighthEdition&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) taking up a common slot, and every white deck seemed to have a couple of Circles tucked in the sideboard. How annoying One of the things I like about *Eighth Edition* is that those Circles of Protection are now all uncommon."

**Q:** "When you were making *Champions of Kamigawa*, how did you decide which instants and sorceries were going to be Arcane and which ones weren't?"  

-- Brady, Monrovia, CA


**A:** From **Brian Schneider**, **Magic** R&D:


"*Champions of Kamigawa* has a spirit world vs. humanoid world theme running throughout, and Arcane vs. non-Arcane is based in that, so typically it was that Spirit/Humanoid conflict that guided us. For example, [Rend Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rend+Flesh) has Arcane because it is a spell spirits would play to combat humanoids. [Rend Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rend+Spirit) doesn't have Arcane because, in part, humans typically don't have the ability to play spirit magic. It also doesn't have Arcane because the effect specifically targets Spirits."


  
### November 22, 2004


**Q:** "Has Wizards of the Coast considered running ***Magic** Online* tournaments for the Team and Prismatic formats?"  

-- Ryan  

Pittsburgh, PA


**A:** From **Scott Larabee**, ***Magic** Online* Tournament Coordinator:


"Thanks for your email, Ryan.


"Not only does Wizards consider it...we are doing it! ***Magic** Online* will hold the first ever Prismatic Format Premier Event on Sunday, November 28 at 9AM PST. You can [read about the details here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/magiconline/article111704).


"As for other formats (such as Team), we are always evaluating formats for ***Magic** Online* events."


  
### November 19, 2004


**Q:** "What reasons were behind the decision to leave the pain lands ([Karplusan Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karplusan+Forest), etc.) out of *Eighth Edition*?"  

--Joseph  

Kansas City, Missouri, USA


**A:** From **Robert Gutschera**, **Magic** R&D:


"The initial reason the [*Eighth Edition* come-into-play-tapped multilands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=into_play_tapped&fields=%7Cname%7Crules%7Ctype&format=EighthEdition&color=L&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) were put in was for elegance. They are a bit cleaner than the pain lands, and seemed nicer for a beginner set. Also, we just like to change the environment around. We had the [pain lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=:_add_%7Bo1%7D&fields=%7Cname%7Crules%7Ctype&format=SeventhEdition&color=L&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) in *Seventh* and several earlier editions, and we thought it was time to take them out and try something different. As we make changes like this, sometimes the best cards of any given type (here lands, but the same thoughts apply to counterspells, weenie creatures, big creatures, or pretty much any kind of card you can think of) will be in 'Nth' Edition, and sometimes they will be in whatever expert level set is current. We think the variety keeps **Magic** more interesting!"


  
### November 18, 2004


**Q:** "Did you guys ever consider making an anthology of the stories from *Champions*? Because I've read the book (outlaw) and all the website stories, but I was wondering if there was more?"  

-- Patrick Perkins


**A:** From **Brandon Bozzi**, **Magic** R&D:


"Patrick, thanks for the question. Besides the novel and the [web stories](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displayexpansion.asp?set=chk&page=2&lang=en), both of which you've read, the other place I can point you is to the flavor text. We made a special effort this time to weave the stories of this world into the cards. Reading the flavor text will help you get a broader picture of the people and places in Kamigawa outside what is in the novel and web stories. Otherwise, you'll have to wait for the *Betrayers of Kamigawa* novel, and if all goes well, the *Betrayers* web stories."

![Ferocious Charge art](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_askwizards_1104_pic2_en.jpg)


**Q:** "I was looking at [Ferocious Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferocious+Charge) and saw in the bottom left corner two elves running away. Are those the elves [Glissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa) and her friend at the beginning of the story *The Moons of Mirrodin*?"  

--Nick  

Lelystad, Flevoland, Netherlands


**A:** From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** Creative Director:


"I'd love to tell you they are, Nick, but the artist had no knowledge of the finer points of Will McDermott's novel, *The Moons of Mirrodin*, and the art description didn't contain any mention of [Glissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa) or Kane. Any resemblance is unfortunately coincidental."


  
### November 16, 2004


**Q:** "Given the popularity of the APAC lands, were there similar lands done for any of the other continents?"  

--jing  

Philippines


**A:** From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** Creative Director:


"Yes, a small series of lands were given away to Europeans who bought boxes of *Nemesis*, *Prophecy* and *Invasion*. Like the APAC lands, they represent real-world locales, and three different versions of each basic land were made. In fact, on October 21st the Card of the Day on magicthegathering.com was a [Euro Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Euro%2BForest). If you look very closely, you can see that at the very bottom of the Forest it says 'Nottingham Forest, U.K.'"


  
  
### November 15, 2004


**Q:** "Where can I find information about the *Unhinged* release events coming up?"


**A:** From **Damon Edmondson**, DCI Program Manager:


"The *Unhinged* Worldwide Release Tournaments will be held on Saturday, November 20, 2004. [Click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases) to find a tournament location near you."


  
### November 12, 2004


**Q:** "Does the 'Reserved List' ever expire so you can re-evaluate cards for potential reprinting down the road?"  

-- Tom  

The Netherlands


**A:** From **Randy Buehler**, Director of **Magic** R&D:


"No -- Wizards of the Coast promised we would never reprint any of the cards on the [Reserved List](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/products/ReprintPolicy), so we're never going to reprint them. There are a number of cards that we wish we could reprint, but a promise is a promise."


  
### November 11, 2004


**Q:** "In watching the Pro Tour (and all webcast **Magic** games), there is a person sitting next to the judge with a laptop. What is that person doing and why are they there?"  

--Marc  

Macon, Georgia, USA


**A:** From **Greg Collins**, **magichthegathering.com**:


"Those nattily attired gentlemen are part of **magicthegathering.com**'s official event coverage team. They're the master scribes bringing you feature-match coverage, deck tech articles, features, and all the other content from Pro Tour and Grand Prix events. At [Pro Tour-Columbus](/en/events/coverage/canali-crushes-columbus), the writing crew consisted of Brian David-Marshall, Ted Knutson, Michael Turian and Gary Wise."


  
### November 10, 2004


**Q:** "Recently you answered a question about the pronunciation of the word 'Krovikan.' I've got a much tougher one I've always wondered about. How do you pronounce 'Kjeldoran?'"  

--Daniel  

Palm Bay, Florida, USA


**A:** From **Brandon Bozzi**, **Magic** R&D Creative Coordinator:


"We've been told that in some Scandinavian languages, it's 'shel-DOR-uhn,' with the 'shel' sound being weird and hard for the English-speaking tongue to duplicate. However, as far as **Magic** is concerned it's 'kyel-DOR-uhn,' where the first syllable rhymes with 'yell.'"


  
### November 11, 2004


**Q:** "When are the commemorative decks for this year's Worlds going to be available, and which archetypes will they be?"  

-- Rick  

Brighton, UK


**A:** From **Wendy Wallace**, Magic Brand:


"This year's World Championship Decks will be available on Tuesday, November 23rd. The decks are Julien Nuijten's Eternal Slide, Aeo Paquette's Affinity, Manuel Bevand's Ironworks, and Gabriel Nassif's Blue-White Control. There should be something for everyone!"


  
### November 8, 2004


**Q:** "In your JSS section of the website, you said you would be posting JSS challenge locations in mid-October. What's up?"  

--Neal  

Northampton, MA


**A:** From **Reid Schmadeka**, North and South America Events Manager:


"The current schedule and factsheet are both posted [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/jss). We regrettably didn't get these posted until the end of October, but part of the delay was because we were making some important changes to how JSS Challenges work. For example, last year's prizes of Magic Cards for a Year to the winner and all-new foil promo cards are still there, but now we offer scholarships to both first *and* second place! Please take a look at the fact sheet to see all the exciting new details about the 2005 JSS season."


  
### November 5, 2004


**Q:** "Just curious how the minds of pro players work. I find it interesting that pro players judge cards so much by speed, saying that anything with a mana cost over 4 is too expensive for a tourney deck, and then a deck like [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) pops up. Why is it that [Crusade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusade) is so much better than [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem), yet a 7 mana sorcery wins games?"  

-- Joseph


**A:** From **Matt Place**, **Magic** R&D:


"Hi Joseph,


"Players that say, 'anything with a mana cost over four is too expensive for a tourney deck,' are bonkers. Not only have there been lots of five, six and seven mana cards but there have also been cards like [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath) and [Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) in top level magic decks. Many players first see a card like [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) and decide it is too expensive for their tournament decks, but history has proven that even the expensive cards can be very powerful when used correctly. It's just one reason why the open-minded player who is willing to take a second look tends to have a real advantage in **Magic**."


  
### November 4, 2004


**Q:** "In Grand Prix coverage I often see players with asterisks next to their names... What does it mean?"  

-- Davey


**A:** From **Scott M. Larabee**, DCI Program Manager, Organized Play:


"The asterisk is used to denote those players that have amateur status. All Grand Prix events have a $25,000 prize payout. $7,500 of the payout ($5,000 at Team-format Grand Prix) is reserved for those player with zero lifetime Pro Points. The asterisks help the amateur players in the tournament see where they are in the standings in relation to each other.


"The full Grand Prix payout, information about amateur status and pro points, as well as other Premier Event information can be found in the **Magic**  Premier Event Invitation Policy located in the [DCI Document Section](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/utr/intro) of [www.thedci.com](http://www.thedci.com)."


  
### November 3, 2004


**Q:** "Are Orcs being phased out in favor of Goblins?"  

-- Matt  

Maine, USA


**A:** From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** Creative Director:


"I'm not sure how to answer your question, Matt, because the last new Orc we printed was [Orcish Settlers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Settlers), from the *Weatherlight* set. That was more than seven years ago. All the Orcs since then have been reprints in core sets (such as *Eighth Edition's*  [Orcish Spy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Spy) and [Orcish Artillery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Artillery)). So I think the phasing out of Orcs was done long ago, back when I was a lowly editor. But they'll continue to appear as core sets, and I'm sure they'll make a comeback in an expert-level expansion someday. Frankly, I'm in no hurry to bring them back. I think they're boring. Although **Magic** and the entire fantasy genre owe an awful lot to Tolkien, I don't think it's good or interesting if **Magic** features every single kind of creature that appears in *The Lord of the Rings*."


  
### November 2, 2004


**Q:** "I saw a guy the other day with a deck of cards that said Berlin on the back. Where do these come from?"  

--Matt M.  

Huntington, West Virginia, USA


**A:** From **Paul Sottosanti**, **Magic** R&D:


![Daniel Zink's 2003 World Championship deck](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_askwizards_1104_pic1_en.jpg)


"After each World Championships, we create commemorative versions of four of the top decks so that players around the world can see what it's like to play those matchups for themselves. The cards aren't tournament legal (if they were, values for the cards contained inside would plummet) so they have gold borders and each year has a special design for the back. In this case, the 2003 World Championships were held in Berlin, and the reprinted decks are the following:"


* [Daniel Zink - Mirari's Wake](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displaythemedeck.asp?set=worldchampionshipdecks2003&decknum=1&lang=en)
* [Dave Humphreys - Blue/Green Madness](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displaythemedeck.asp?set=worldchampionshipdecks2003&decknum=2&lang=en)
* [Wolfgang Eder - Goblin Bidding](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displaythemedeck.asp?set=worldchampionshipdecks2003&decknum=3&lang=en)
* [Peer Kroger - Reanimator](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displaythemedeck.asp?set=worldchampionshipdecks2003&decknum=4&lang=en)

  
### November 1, 2004


**Q:** "Who is Jaya Ballard, and what is a task mage?"  

--Gabe  

Biloxi, MS


**A:** From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** Creative Director:


"Jaya Ballard is the wisecracking mage featured in *Ice Age*-block flavor text and in the novels *The Eternal Ice* and *The Shattered Alliance* by Jeff Grubb. Although her story begins when she is only a skilled task mage, her path leads her to a much greater destiny. A task mage is a wizard for hire, a mercenary sorcerer."
