Like, at certain times of the year, well-meaning relatives will express their love through the medium of gifts? It can be tricky buying a present for a **Magic** player if you don't know much about **Magic** yourself.


And that's why Wizards of the Coast is introducing the Holiday Gift Box! It's a handsome storage box that holds more than 2,000 cards. The MSRP is $19.99Â ***\*Applies to U.S. Only*** and it will be available worldwide in English on November 16, 2012.

* Four *Return to Ravnica* booster packs
* A pack of twenty *Return to Ravnica* basic land
* Six illustrated plastic dividers
* A sticker sheet for customizing the dividers
* An alternate-art Dreg Mangler from *Return to Ravnica*. We're not going to tell you what Dreg Mangler does.
