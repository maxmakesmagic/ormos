Today's [Uncharted Realms by Adam Lee](/node/228446) revealed the newest addition to the *Magic 2015* lineup of Planeswalkers, Nissa, Worldwaker. Peter Mohrbacher's updated take on the Zendikari elf is sure to be a fan favorite (it doesn't hurt that the card itself is pretty powerful), so for all of the Nissa fans out there both new and old, we've created wallpapers showing off the Planeswalker, just for you.
