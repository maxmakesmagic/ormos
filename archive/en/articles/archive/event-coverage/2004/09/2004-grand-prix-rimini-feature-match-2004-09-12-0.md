While neither is well known, today should give them a very good chance of making a name for themselves. Rampini is running Affinity while Ottati has blue-green control. Rampini didn't get off to a good start in the morning as he mulliganed down to five going first. Ottati went straight for the throat with an [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) on Rampini's opening land. Rampini's five cards had fortunately contained a lot of land and he was able to recover with two [Seat of the Synod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod). A [Myr Retriever](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Retriever) was [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend)ed but Rampini was able to resolve first an AEther Vial and then a Ravager to go with his first turn Worker.


Ottati dug through his deck with [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), finding a [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) to take care of the dangerous Vial. Despite starting 3 cards up Ottati didn't seem to be capitalising as a [Myr Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) was added to the forces facing him. He bounced a Ravager with [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth).


Then in his turn Ottati finally took control. [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) left Rampini with only one land. An AEther Spellbomb allowed Ottati to return his [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) to kill the Enforcer. Left with only an [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) and a [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) Rampini conceded.


Ottati 1-0 Rampini


Rampini got to play with a full hand this game. His turn one Vial was [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize)d but he had plenty of gas. An [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) was followed by a Rigger and then a [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault). Ottati had no islands and could only fetch back an [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) with an [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness).


It was all to slow as a couple of [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)s dug Rampini deeper into his deck, did two damage to Ottati through the Disciple and grew the Rigger. An [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) joined the assault, forcing a chump-block from the Witness. When a second [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) appeared Ottati picked up his cards.


Ottati 1-1 Rampini


Ottati set up his hand with a couple of [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) while Rampini started with Worker, [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast). The Visions had found Ottati a forest to play [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman), but the [Seat of the Synod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod) it blew up was quickly replaced by another.


[Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) prevented a dangerous Rigger from entering play. Then a [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) chopped Rampini off at the knees, wiping out his entire mana base. He resorted to using lands a 1 point of damage through the Disciple. Only another fifteen needed.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprim04/fm10_2.jpg)A Shaman blew up a [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) to reduce it to only 14 land required. It didn't seem like Rampini would get that much time. Another Shaman left him with only a [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), Disciple and [Glimmervoid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid). When Rampini's AEther Vial was [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)led he extended the hand.


Domingo Ottati beats Stefano Rampini 2-1
