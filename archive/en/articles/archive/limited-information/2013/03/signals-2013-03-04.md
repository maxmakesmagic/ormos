I am just getting home after two awesome weeks in Canada covering [Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/welcome) and [Grand Prix Quebec City](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpque13/welcome). Both events featured high-level play and excitement, to boot. Still, all I want to do when I get home is draft. 

 One might assume I'd want a break from **Magic** after such a trip. The fact is, talking about **Magic** constantly—but not actually playing—charges the draft batteries for when I get home.
