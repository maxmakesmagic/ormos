**Card of the Day - vendredi 30 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Time%20Walk)#### Time Walk

 Alpha rare. Time Walk originally read: “Target opponent loses next turn.” It was changed because it sounded like the game was over on the next turn!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 29 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Timesifter)#### Timesifter


*Mirrodin* rare. In design this just revealed the card rather than also removing it. It changed because of the nasty interaction with combos like Twisted Abomination + Unholy Grotto. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 28 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Time%20and%20Tide)#### Time and Tide


*Visions* uncommon. The design version of the card with this name was originally a blue mirror of Fireblast: counter target spell with an alternate casting cost of returning two Islands to your hand. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 27 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Time%20Stretch)#### Time Stretch


*Odyssey* rare. Originally designed as a flashback card that gave you 1 turn, it proved too difficult to set a proper casting cost since players were able to split the total cost over two turns. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 26 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Time%20Vault)#### Time Vault

 Alpha rare. One of only three cards in **Magic** history to have appeared on the Type 1 Banned List and then later become unrestricted. (The other two are Shahrazad and Divine Intervention.) 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 23 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Chirurgeon)#### Goblin Chirurgeon


*Fallen Empires* common. In the Phil Foglio version of this card’s art, the creature being stitched together has the head of a Llanowar Elf, a Cat Warrior's body, and an Uthden Troll’s arm. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 22 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Clash)#### Mana Clash


*The Dark* rare. Of the 155 **Magic** cards printed for the cost of ![Red Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/red_mana.gif), only Mana Clash can (potentially) win the game on turn 1 without any other help.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 21 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zodiac%20Dragon)#### Zodiac Dragon


*Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. One of 12 cards in *Portal Three Kingdoms* correlating to the Chinese Zodiac, Zodiac Dragon has the most expensive casting cost in the set. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 20 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mogg%20Fanatic)#### Mogg Fanatic


*Tempest* common. Part of a 5-card cycle of 1 mana 1/1s with an ability, only this and Blood Pet made it to print in *Tempest*. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 19 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Magnetic%20Mountain)#### Magnetic Mountain


*Arabian Nights* uncommon. Magnetic Mountain’s claim to fame is having the vowels a-e-i-o-u appear in its name, all in the correct order! 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 16 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Duplicity)#### Duplicity


*Tempest* rare. The art for this card depicts Starke plotting to assassinate the Oracle en-Vec.

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=City%20of%20Shadows)#### City of Shadows

**Card of the Day - mercredi 14 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=City%20of%20Traitors)#### City of Traitors


*Exodus* rare. Located beneath the Stronghold, the City of Traitors was the last refuge for exiles and criminals. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 13 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=City%20of%20Brass)#### City of Brass

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=City%20in%20a%20Bottle)#### City in a Bottle


*Arabian Nights* rare. Created by Richard Garfield, this card was inspired by a story from Neil Gaiman’s graphic novel *Ramadan* (Sandman #50).
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 9 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Minion%20of%20Leshrac)#### Minion of Leshrac


*Ice Age* rare. The only demon printed with protection from a color, the “Leshrac” part of the name is an anagram of “Charles”. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 8 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Minion%20of%20Tevesh%20Szat)#### Minion of Tevesh Szat


*Ice Age* rare. **Magic**’s smallest printed demon, Minion of Tevesh Set is still pretty beefy by most standards!
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 7 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Demonic%20Hordes)#### Demonic Hordes


*Alpha* rare. The other demon from the original core set, the *Alpha* version of Demonic Hordes mistakenly had “BBB” in the rules text rather than ![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif).
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 6 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lord%20of%20the%20Pit)#### Lord of the Pit


*Alpha* rare. The largest demon ever printed, Lord of the Pit was also the largest flier until Devouring Strossus came along in Invasion. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 5 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boris%20Devilboon)#### Boris Devilboon

**Card of the Day - vendredi 2 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Glasses%20of%20Urza)#### Glasses of Urza


*Alpha* uncommon. The presence of both Glasses of Urza and Sunglasses of Urza led to a running joke at Wizards of the Coast that Urza had two heads. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 1 juillet 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gustha's%20Scepter)#### Gustha's Scepter
