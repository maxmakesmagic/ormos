Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






It's the eve of a new year and, just as enticing for *Magic* fans, the eve of the eve of the first  [Friday Night *Magic*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/friday-night-magic)  of 2015. That means a new set of FNM promos and, starting in February, a cool twist on how alternative art for the FNM promos is handled for a few months.



But we're getting ahead of ourselves. First, the known quantities.



January
=======



A new year makes a good time to add new art to yourâ€¦Goblin deck? Kev Walker updates the most frenzied of Goblins. I wouldn't expect your opponents to do much blocking once you get your hands on a few of these Frenzied Goblins.

February
========



We already previewed the Disdainful Stroke for February, complete with sweet alternative art. But what we didn't point out was that this was the start of a mini-pattern of alternative *Khans of Tarkir* art that shows a timeline where dragons rule the roost. This promo shows off a dragon in place of the Naga casting the spell. The flavor text takes on a whole new meaning when you imagine a dragon being quoted in an alternative timeline.

March
=====



Which brings us to Hordeling Outburst, the March FNM promo card. This one even more closely mirrors the original (with art still by Zoltan Boros!), although now, instead of a trio of goblins emerging from shelter to rush into battle, they're fleeing a dragon who looks very, very hungry.
