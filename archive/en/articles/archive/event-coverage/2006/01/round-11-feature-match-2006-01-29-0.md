It's the second round on this Sunday morning, both Gabriel and Bernardo have 8-2 scores coming into this match. Before play gets underway Bernardo talks about the good cards in Nassif's deck. Apparently, Gabriel has double [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix), double [Devouring Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light) and double Legionnaire.


Bernardo has a great start though. It's turn one [Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow), turn 2 [Farseek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek), turn 3 [Three Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Three+Dreams) fetching [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters), [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) and [Clinging Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Darkness). What makes it even better is the fact that he is also holding [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath), which should be enough to gain control of this game. In the meantime Gab's [Viashino Fangtail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Fangtail) gets [Brainspoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainspoil)ed, while a [Nightguard Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightguard+Patrol) deals some points of damage. Finally the Strands gets played, netting [Mindmoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindmoil) and Firmemane Angel. Even though Gabriel is up to 32 life points due to [Firemane Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemane+Angel) and two Helixes, Bernardo is never in danger of actually losing this game. A few turns later a [Drooling Groodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drooling+Groodion) comes down on Cabral's side, along with [Bramble Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental) and [Scion of the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+the+Wild). This team has no problem in dealing 32 damage to Gabriel, who drew a lot of blanks after his hand got discarded.


Bernardo 1-0

Gabriel again misses out on an aggressive start, but he manages to deal with a [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) with [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) in [Devouring Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light). [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) kills [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp), and his [Viashino Fangtail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Fangtail) and [Wojek Embermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wojek+Embermage) team make sure Bernardo is never able to enchant [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) to one of his creatures. Eventually [Flash Conscription](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+Conscription) kills two of Bernardo's guys, who will try his luck in Game 3.


1-1


After two games in which both players have had one good draw and one bad draw, Game 3 is often anticlimactic. Both Cabral and Nassif easily reach 10 and 9 mana respectively, which is not something they were looking for. Again, [Flash Conscription](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+Conscription) kills Bernardo's best creature, while Nassif is dealing just two damage a turn with [Nightguard Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightguard+Patrol). Eventually Bernardo is down to seven, when he plays [Drooling Groodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drooling+Groodion) with one other creature on his side and four mana up. Gabriel untaps and casts [Master Warcraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Warcraft), using it as a Falter, dealing four damage to Bernardo, who kills the Patrol before damage. Four damage is just what Gab was looking for, as [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) seals the deal.


Gabriel wins 2-1
