Daniel Kwiatkowski is the reigning King of the Hill. Kwiatkowski enters the second day of competition with an unscathed record. A top 32 at the Indianapolis Legacy Grand Prix shows that Kwiatkowski has what it takes to compete at the highest level. Kwiatkowski is armed with Boros Burn, one of Standard's premier strategies. 



 His opponent, Steven Rubin, is a two-time Pro Tour competitor (Atlanta and Montreal) that piloted his Black Devotion strategy to an undefeated record through the first nine rounds. Rubin's sideboard features [Brindle Boar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brindle+Boar) and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to augment the Grey Merchant of Asphodel in his maindeck. These lifegain effects could prove difficult for Kwiatkowski to overcome.




**Game 1**



Kwiatkowski won the roll and both players kept their opening hands. 



 Rubin started things off with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and quickly realized he was staring down the barrel of a fiery canon. [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) went to the graveyard, but Kwiatkowski's hand was still full of gas.



Chandra's Phoenix came down for Kwiatkowski and flew directly across the table for two points of damage. It met Hero's Downfall on the following turn, but Kwiatkowski's Warleader's Helix ensured that it would be back to fight another day. 



 Chandra's Phoenix returned to the board, but the freshly cast [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) from Rubin kept it on the defensive.




 Chandra's Phoenix blocked [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) the following turn, and [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) at the end of Rubin's turn left him at a precarious six life.




 Another burn spell put him to three. [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) was sacrificed to the demon, the Phoenix returned to put Rubin down to one life, and a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) was enough to finish the game in a flurry of fire.




**Kwiatkowski 1 - 0 Rubin**
