This weekend players around the world will take part in the [*Born of the Gods* Game Day](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/gameday-facts). Not only will they be able to compete in the Standard tournament at the heart of the Game Day events, but also they'll have the chance to complete the sixth step on the [Hero's Path](http://www.mtgHerosPath.com).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1372_12h7dfa8sdfsdf.jpg)We introduced the [Battle the Horde](/en/articles/archive/battle-horde-2013-11-26) activity a few weeks ago and now it's here! You can face the horde by yourself, or you can team up with a few of your friends to face the Minotaur horde - here's how!


 



> **Multiplayer rules:** Follow the rules as printed [on the playmat](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/arcana/EN_9lakm7zfyxoe.pdf) for the Minotaur deck. All players facing the Minotaurs will have a shared life total of 20 life. For each additional player in the game the Minotaur deck flips an additional card. So if you and a friend are facing the horde, each turn the Minotaur deck flips three cards.


Now be sure to battle the horde and collect the next hero card for your Hero's Path! And if you really enjoy beating down on the Minotaur horde, you can even talk to your store about purchasing your own copy of the deck.
