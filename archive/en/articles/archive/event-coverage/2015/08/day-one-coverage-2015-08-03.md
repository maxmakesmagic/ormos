Day One of Magic Weekend 2008 is in the books. Two players sit atop the standings with undefeated records: Christopher O'Bryant and David Sharfman. O'Bryant made his way to Chicago via a top finish in the Indianapolis Regionals, while Sharfman did the same in Orlando.

 Sitting behind the undefeated pair is a group of 13 players at 18 points, including such notables as Sam Stein, Sam Black, Brandon Scheel, Shaheen Soorani, Michael Jacob, and 2006 national champion Paul Cheon. A pair of Pro Tour champions—Gadiel Szleifer and Mark Herberholz—are at the top of the 15-pointers, along with 2007 U.S. champion Luis Scott-Vargas.

 Tune in Saturday for three more rounds of Booster Draft and four rounds of Standard as we head toward the cut to the Top 8. In addition, Saturday features the 2008 Vintage Championship, more Public Event coverage, a recap of the Magic Game Show, and much more!
