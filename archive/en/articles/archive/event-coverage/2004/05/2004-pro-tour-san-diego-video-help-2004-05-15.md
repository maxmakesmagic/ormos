![Watch live streaming video on Day 3](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsd04/vhelp.jpg) To view the Pro Tour San Diego 2004 video coverage files you'll need to ensure you have the latest version of [QuickTime](http://www.quicktime.com) installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of [QuickTime](http://www.quicktime.com) by clicking [here](http://www.quicktime.com).

Once you've installed [QuickTime](http://www.quicktime.com), you'll want to save the .zip file to your computer instead of opening it. Select the 'Save' option instead of 'Open' when it prompts you to do so. 

After you've saved the file to your computer you should be able to unzip it. If you don't have a zip program you can download [WinZip](http://www.winzip.com) by clicking [here](http://www.winzip.com). After unzipping the file simply open the MP4 movie and you should be able to view it automatically in [QuickTime](http://www.quicktime.com).

Enjoy the Pro Tour San Diego 2004 video coverage, and stay tuned for streaming video coverage of the Top 8 live from the show floor beginning at 9:00am PST on Sunday!
