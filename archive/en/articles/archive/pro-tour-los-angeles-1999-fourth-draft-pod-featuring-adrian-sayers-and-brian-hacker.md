![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/PTLA99/images/GeertsenR13.JPG)In this draft, we feature the blue haired wonder Brian Hacker and Team Austi-Knights' Adrian Sayers. During the draft, Sayers sat to the right of Hacker, choosing first during the first and third packs. Below are the picks they decided to choose (showing in parentheses the order of which they picked for each pack). The first player shown at the top was the first to choose between the two during each pack.


**Pod Order of Drafting**


1. Dave Price  

2. Koichiro Maki  

3. Ken Simpson  

4. Brian Fenwick  

5. Adrian Sayers  

6. Brian Hacker  

7. Nathan Heiss  

8. Svend Geertsen


**1st Round of Eight Packs**  

(Sayers 5th in order passing to Hacker 6th)  

Players are choosing cards in clockwise order.



```

**1st Pack**
Sayer's Choices                Hacker's Choices
Disciple of Grace (5th Pick)   Polluted Mire (6th Pick)
Healing Salve (12th Pick)      Attunement (11th Pick)

```

With little reaching them during their picks, Adrian Sayers chose the Disciple of Grace, hoping to claim White early on. Brian Hacker's choice of a Polluted Mire early on showed those around him that he had every intention of forcing Black and that they should stay away. "I know that Nathan Heiss (to Hacker's left) is notorious for drafting Black. I wanted him to know that he wasn't getting it this time."



```

**2nd Pack**
Sayer's Choices                Hacker's Choices
Custodian (4th Pick)           Voice of Grace (5th Pick)
Venomous Fangs (13th Pick)     Rejuvenate (12th Pick)

**3rd Pack**
Sayer's Choices                Hacker's Choices
Endoskeleton (3rd Pick)        Symbiosis (4th Pick)
Rejuvenate (14th Pick)         ROP: White (13th Pick)

**4th Pack**
Sayer's Choices                Hacker's Choices
Glorious Anthem (2nd Pick)     Cradle Guard (3rd Pick)
Disruptive Student (15th Pick) Exhume (14th Pick)

**5th Pack**
Sayer's Choices                Hacker's Choices
Humble (1st Pick)              Corrupt (2nd Pick)
                               Serra Zealot (15th Pick)

```

By this time in the draft, both Adrian and Brian were working towards drafting specific colors (Adrian-White...Hacker-Green/Black). More specifically, Nathan Heiss (to the left of Hacker) was drafting White and Brian Fenwick (to the right of Sayers) was getting Black. Though close in proximity, Fenwick's Black drafting would never pose a problem for Brian, as quality cards always found their way through.



```

**6th Pack**
Sayer's Choices                Hacker's Choices
Winding Wurm (8th Pick)        Vampiric Embrace (1st Pick)
Opal Caryatid (9th Pick) 

**7th Pack**
Sayer's Choices                Hacker's Choices
Argothian Swine (7th Pick)     Blood Vassal (8th Pick)
Disenchant (10th Pick)         Cave Tiger (9th Pick)

**8th Pack**
Sayer's Choices                Hacker's Choices
Monk Realist (6th Pick)        Falter (7th Pick)
Opal Caryatid (11th Pick)      Dark Ritual (10th Pick)

```

**2nd Round of Eight Packs**  

(Hacker 3rd in order passing to Sayers 4th)  

Packs are being passed counter-clockwise.



```

**1st Pack**
Hacker's Choices               Sayer's Choices               
Dark Hatchling (3rd Pick)      Cave Tiger (4th Pick)
Disruptive Student (14th Pick) Drifting Meadow (13th Pick)

```

As he drafted his second pick Disenchant, Heiss looked at Hacker (whom he was passing to) as if to say, "Here's your birthday present." In many drafts, such body language signals that one player is willing to give the other as many good cards in a specific color as long as he gets quality in return. In this case, Hacker drafted a completely useful Dark Hatchling 3rd pick.



```

**2nd Pack**
Hacker's Choices               Sayer's Choices               
Pestilence (2nd Pick)          Symbiosis (3rd Pick)
Disruptive Student (15th Pick) Planar Birth (14th Pick)

```

Once again, the love from the left side of Hacker came through when Nathan Heiss took a White card over Pestilence. Adrian began getting more and more Green support cards, allowing him to splash the color with his strong White once deck construction began. Surprisingly, Hacker received enough Green to splash as well.



```

**Summary**


For the most part, all the players at the table drafting together received playable decks, while the one or two whom counterdrafted or failed to find their place in the color scheme failed to get a strong deck. The keys to getting the more powerful decks centered around players willing to take a chance early and draft a weaker card in an effort to corner the color. Hacker's first choice (5th pick of the pack) of a Polluted Mire sent the message to his neighbors that he was willing to sacrifice to get the Black cards and the gambit paid off for him.
