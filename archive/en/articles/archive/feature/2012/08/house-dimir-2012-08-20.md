House Dimir
**My Secrecy. My Advantage. My Guild.**
In the dark, slick corridors of the undercity lurks the unfathomable network of the Dimir guild. House Dimir is Ravnica’s dark but open secret: the populace knows Dimir exists but they pretend it doesn’t. The Dimir’s role in Ravnica is to provide covert services that other guilds can’t or won’t, using their secrecy as both weapon and defense. Dimir is hidden even from itself, using pockets of covert agents who are aware of only a few other contacts. Dimir agents leave no trace, destroying memories of witnesses to their crimes, and even going so far as to eliminate their own memories of their assignments.

**Lazav, the Dimir Mastermind.** Lazav is a shapeshifting mage who serves as the nexus of telepathic impressions of the entire Dimir network. He (or she, or it) shapeshifts into a variety of guises as his needs and plans require; he may step out into the Ravnican streets as an elderly widow to eavesdrop at the bazaar, become a vedalken hussar to sidestep a checkpoint, or transform into a Tin Street merchant to deceive a passing noble. Some Dimir agents believe that Lazav plots against Niv-Mizzet to discern the dragon’s hidden endgame and twist it for his own purposes.

**Duskmantle: Restored but Undisclosed.** Duskmantle, the Dimir guildhall, fell into disrepair after the previous guildmaster, Szadek, fell from power and the knowledge of how to access it was lost. Duskmantle has been recreated in a new location deep within the Ravnican undercity, shielded by memory wards. Few know of the existence of this House Dimir nerve center, and even fewer know how to locate it. Many who learn the way lose that memory soon after.
