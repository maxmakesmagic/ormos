**Player Contact Phone Number:** Laura Waniuk: 09030497310



### DECKLISTS


* Decklists must be filled out clearly in printed block letters using. Complete English card names must be used.
* For constructed formats, decklists will be collected at the beginning of the first round of each of the Standard and Extended days. Players must have their decklists on the table (folded in half once) when the round begins.
* Decklists without a name, or with a name that is unreadable by the judge will result in an automatic game loss.
* Players who submit a decklist that lists an illegal deck (such as a decklist that has less than 60 cards for constructed formats or 40 cards for limited formats) will be disqualified from the tournament.
* Players who list an illegal sideboard (incorrect number of cards or illegal cards) will receive a game loss and will not be able to use a sideboard for the remainder of that format.
* If a player is found to be using a deck that is different from what is listed on their decklist, the deck will be modified to fit the decklist and a game loss will be given.
* Reminder: The most common error on a decklist is a mistake in the sideboard portion or a mistake in the number of lands a player is using. Please be sure to double check your decklist before the beginning of the tournament.

### TOURNAMENT PROCEDURES


* Competitors must report to the player meeting at 7:00 PM on Tuesday evening at the Pacifico Yokohama. Competitors will be assigned random seats for the player meeting; these seats are only used for the meeting and allow the head scorekeeper to verify all players have been added correctly.
* Before each draft, competitors will also be assigned random seating for a short instructional player briefing. Competitors will report to their seats to listen to any final instructions before draft pod pairings are posted. These seats are the same seats that will be used for deck construction immediately following the draft.

### APPEALS


* If a competitor believes that a judge has given an incorrect ruling, they may appeal to the head judge.
* Competitors must wait for the judge to complete his ruling before making an appeal.
* A competitor must clearly state the basis for making an appeal.
* If the head judge believes that a competitor is abusing the appeal system, he may assign a penalty for unsporting conduct.

### USING RESULT ENTRY SLIPS


* Each match will have a paper Result Entry Slip that is used to record the results of the match.
* Players may not leave their seats until a Result Entry Slip has been completed for the match.
* Once a match is completed, players record how many games each player won in the column beside their name.
* Draws are also recorded. Unfinished games do not count as draws; they are simply not marked.
* Players sign the slip after verifying that both scores are correct. Players may not sign a blank slip.
* Once both players have signed the Result Entry Slip, they should raise their hand for a judge to collect the slip.
* If a judge gives a time extension (for lengthy rulings, deck checks, etc.) he or she will note the extra time on the slip.
* If a player wishes to drop, they must do so by marking the slip with "DROP" beside their name.
* Competitors may only drop before the previous round is completed, and must use the Result Entry Slip for that purpose.
* Competitors who do not drop using proper procedure will be paired for the next round and receive a game loss if they do not play.

### ROCHESTER DRAFT


* All competitors will participate in the Rochester Draft on day 2 of the tournament (Thursday).
* Talking is **completely prohibited** at all times before, during and after the draft, as are hand signals of any kind.
* Most draft pods will consist of 8 players - some draft pods may have 7 players.
* The draft will consist of 3 boosters: Urza's Saga (clockwise), Urza's Legacy (counter-clockwise) and Urza's Destiny (clockwise). All card used for the draft are stamped in a pattern to ensure the addition or trading of cards does not occur.
* Players may only look at cards they have drafted during the 20 second review period and while the cards are being laid out.
* Judges will lay out each booster of 15 cards in three rows of 4 cards and one row of 3 cards.
* The caller of the draft will announce 20 seconds to review the cards once the booster has been laid out.
* The cards may not be moved, and players may not touch the cards during the 20-second review period.
* Competitors will have 4 seconds to select a card once "draft" is called.
* As each card is drafted, the card must be placed face up in one pile in front of the drafter. Once each booster has been drafted and the next booster is being opened, competitors may rearrange their cards in any order they choose.
* If a player does not choose a card before "draft" is called again (for the next player) the judge selects a card for them. The judge must always select the first card that was laid out, or the earliest card remaining, if the first has already been drafted.

**Important Penalties: Below are several common penalties that all competitors should be aware of.**


### LITTERING


* The highest level of responsibility is expected from the competitors in respect to the play area, building, tournament site and all hotel or convention center areas.
* Competitors may not litter in the tournament area or any other area of the site. This includes the side event area, retail area, food areas and all other areas of interior and exterior of the main building and hotels.
* Competitors who litter areas of the building, including the actual tournament area will receive a warning for the first offense and an **automatic game loss** for the second offense.
* If a competitor leaves a significant amount of litter (such as a pile of food wrappers) in any area the head judge has the option of giving an automatic game loss.
* **Reminder:** With video cameras and press representatives at all major tournaments, it is important that all competitors and staff do their part to keep the event and areas surrounding the event as clean and orderly as possible.

### SLOW PLAY


* All players are responsible for playing at a reasonable speed.
* If a player is found to be engaging in slow play (regardless of intent) they will receive a penalty.
* The penalties for slow play are as follows:
* First offense: warning
* Second offense: game loss
* Third offense: match loss
* Fourth offense: disqualification
* **Note:** The head judge may increase the penalty for slow play to accommodate extenuating circumstances or flagrant violations of the spirit of the slow play rule. Penalties for slow play remain on a competitors permanent record in the DCI database, and repeated violations of the slow play guidelines will lead to more severe penalties.

### TIME LIMIT


* The time limit is 60 minutes for constructed formats and 50 minutes for limited formats.
* At the end of the round, all players who are the middle of a game will receive 3 extra turns to finish that game.
* The **active player's current turns counts** as the first of the three turns for that player.
* If the game is completed before using all of the extra turns, or the players are between games when time is called, the match is considered finished.
* This rule can be illustrated as follows:
	+ Time is called. (Active player is player A)
	+ Active player finishes his current turn. (Player A first extra turn)
	+ Player B takes a turn. (Player B first extra turn)
	+ Player A takes a turn. (Player A second extra turn)
	+ Player B takes a turn (Player B second extra turn)
	+ Player A takes a turn (Player A third and final extra turn)
	+ Player B takes a turn (Player B third and final extra turn)
	+ The match is considered completed.

### SHUFFLING/SIDEBOARDING


* At the beginning of each match and between games, players must complete all sideboarding and shuffling within 3 minutes.
* After the opponent has presented their deck (after they have sufficiently randomized their decks), a player has up to 1 minute maximum to cut and/or shuffle their deck.
* If a player accidentally reveals an opponent's card while shuffling, the appropriate DCI Penalty Guidelines will be followed. For the first offense, the player will receive a warning, the second offense will result in a game loss, and the third offense will result in a match loss. The fourth offense will result in disqualification of the player.
