### Review by David Craddock, *[Fantasy Book Critic](http://fantasybookcritic.blogspot.com/2009/06/alara-unbroken-by-doug-beyer-reviewed.html)*


On the surface, *Alara Unbroken* is a story about five worlds merging back into one, and the ramifications that ensue. However, it's rather difficult to muster emotion for large chunks of earth, water, vegetation and volcanoes. Fortunately, Doug Beyer employs a compelling cast and sharp, snappy prose with which to relate his tale. Most chapters focus on one world, one event, and one or two protagonists. Each chapter is approximately two to four pages in length, and many read like self-contained short stories: beginning, middle and end, all in four pages or less.
