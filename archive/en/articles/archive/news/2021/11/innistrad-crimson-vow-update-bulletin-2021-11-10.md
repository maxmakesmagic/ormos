Hello, everyone!


Welcome to the wedding! I really love weddings. The beautiful ceremony, the fun reception, the arcane vampire rituals . . . wait, no one told me about the arcane vampire rituals. Also, is that an angel tied up on the ceiling? You know what, this does not seem like a safe event. Aaaaand now that woman's dress is on fire. OK, I'm just going to keep to myself over here and uh . . . talk about rules and card text changes.


*[Innistrad: Crimson Vow](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/innistrad-crimson-vow)* builds on the rules changes that appeared in *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* with many returning mechanics. New rules detail the new mechanics cleave and training, and the day/night rules are cleaned up a little bit. There are also some minor updates to the Oracle text of some *Magic* cards. This document is written while the rules changes and Oracle changes are still under review, so it's possible they'll be a little different from the final changes. When they're finalized, you'll be able to see them on the [rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) and [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=508148).


Alright, let's dive in!
