The bubble is a scary place to be indeed. Under usual circumstances, all the 7-2 records will advance to Day 2, and everything less dies in a blaze of glory (or a pitiful, weakly ember—context dependent). Going into the last round, there were many recognizable faces at 6-2. If they won in Round 9, they'd be coming back tomorrow. If not, well, at least they'd get to work on time Monday morning. (18) Alex Hayne, teammate Jon Stern, Matt Sperling, (2) Owen Turtenwald, Christian Calcano, Marshall Sutcliffe, and "The" Ben Seck were all hoping to stay strong through the last round.
