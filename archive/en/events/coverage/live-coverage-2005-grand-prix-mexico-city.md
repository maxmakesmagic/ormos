Live Coverage of 2005 Grand Prix Mexico City
============================================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmex05/f_trohpy.jpg)Don't call it a comeback, he's been here a year. It was exactly a year ago this weekend that Julien Nuijten catapulted from cocky little Dutch kid to World Champion and Magic star, and apparently he's making it a policy not to be beaten on Labor Day weekends -- **Magic**  might as well proclaim it as Nuijten Day.


Julien wasn't the only story this weekend, though. The Top 8 here in Mexico City was once again a good one, featuring big names like Frank Karsten and Gerard Fabiano, as well as rising stars Billy Postlethewait and Rasmus "Big Oots" Sibast and the only two Venezuelans in the tournament (Daniel Fior and Maximiliano Liprandi), and a lone hometown hero in Edgar Leiva. Postlethewait actually dominated the tournament, going undefeated this weekend in contested matches, but he had to leave to catch his flight just as the Top 8 was about to begin (allowing Liprandi into the semifinals uncontested).


Joining Liprandi in the semis were Karsten (who downed Big Oots in an all-Euro grudge match), Leiva (who squeaked past Gerard Fabiano), and Nuijten (who crushed Daniel Fior's White Weenie deck). Nuijten was then pushed to his limits in two games against Fior's teammate Liprandi, winning the first at 2 life and the second at 1, while Karsten quickly gave way to Leiva's onslaught, setting up a World Champ vs. Hometown Hero finals. Sadly for the raucous Mexican crowd, Nuijten's draws in the finals were unbeatable and the only trophy from a Mexican Grand Prix would sadly be leaving home soil for the far shores of The Netherlands.


What about the format, you ask? Well, there were only three Gifts decks that made the Top 8, but once again when the dust settled [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) was standing on top of the podium, carrying a trophy and wearing a curly-haired smile. Congratulations to Julien Nuijten, the 2005 Grand Prix-Mexico City champion!

Sunday, September 4: 10:44 am - Quick Interviews and More
---------------------------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmex05/b_derosa.jpg)*Antonino De Rosa*
The buzz about Ravnica in the last couple weeks has gone from a couple of whispers to a rather loud roar, propelled in large part by the preview of one of the new Guild dual lands on magicthegathering.com. To say casual and pro players alike are excited about what the new set will bring is an understatement, but we decided to talk with a few of the pros and let them speak for themselves.


*What do you think of the new dual lands?*


**Antonino De Rosa:** They are good, really good. You can actually play any deck you want to in Extended with the *Onslaught* fetchlands.


**Frank Karsten and Julien Nuijten**


**Julien:** I think they are insane.  



**Olivier Ruel:** They are terrible - two life is a fortune. Wait, actually I take that back. If you have a [Lifegift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifegift), they are okay, and if you have double [Lifegift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifegift) and fetchlands, they become insane. I think I just broke Extended.
