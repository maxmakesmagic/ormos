Need more reasons to jump in? How about an alternate-art foil Planeswalker promo card?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/587_liliana.jpg)  
This alternate-art foil [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) is available only to players of the PS3 version of **Duels of the Planeswalkers**.


**We are sorry but the Liliana Vess promo card with purchase promotion has ended (as per the [Official Terms](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-ps3-official-terms-2010-11-01)).**


Here's how to get one. If you are eligible to receive the promo card (see [Terms & Conditions](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-ps3-official-terms-2010-11-01)) then just start up your copy of **Duels of the Planeswalkers** on your PS3. The first time you'll see the code for your promo card is after you hit "Start" from the start page. After moving through that screen, you can see it again at any time by going to "Help and Options," follwoed by "Redeem Card Code." Note that you must be logged into the Playstation Network in order to see the code.


At the time you get your code, you'll also be given a web address to go to (it's [this page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=promo/duelsoftheplaneswalkers/Default.aspx)). Register on that site to get your voucher and a [list of local stores](/en/articles/archive/2010-11-12) to collect your promo card and free M11 samples decks from. Grab yours now before they are gone! (while supplies lastâ€”restrictions apply)
