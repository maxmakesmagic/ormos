It's the calm before the storm, as *Battle for Zendikar* approaches. This weekend is the *Battle for Zendikar* Prerelease. Next week, the set is released. A week later, [Grand Prix Madison](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-madison-2015) and [Grand Prix Sydney](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-sydney-2015) will give players their first taste of *Battle for Zendikar* at a Premier Play-level before we head into the Pro Tour weekend.


Let's first take a look at last weekend's events, and then we'll peer ahead to the coming weeks.


*Magic* Community Cup
=====================


It was a tight race between the Wizards team and the Community team, but the Community team managed to edge out the Wizards team in the final rounds, ensuring that the Community once again claimed the Community Cup (rats).


With the *Magic Online* community denied its [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow)s from the Team Wizards win that all should have been preparing for, the *Magic* community has instead been rewarded with some very beautiful full-art basic lands and a [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) promo on *Magic Online* if they logged in during the Community Cup.

2015 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers—Round 3
=========================================


The third and final round of the 2015 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers took place last weekend. Aside from a couple of finalizations of the remaining slots and the completion of one World *Magic* Cup Qualifier that needed to be moved (Chile), the vast majority of the teams have been locked down.


The current list of invited players for the World *Magic* Cup can be found [on this page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/2015wmc/invitationlist), with more than a few countries packing serious lineups as we head into the World *Magic* Cup in Barcelona December 11–13. Brian David-Marshall has the details on some of these teams today, so check out [The Week That Was](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/week-was/world-magic-cup-first-look-2015-09-25) this week for the latest!


In the meantime, we've got some World *Magic* Cup Qualifier decklists for you, showcasing the Standard format one more time before we move into the set rotation in a week.
