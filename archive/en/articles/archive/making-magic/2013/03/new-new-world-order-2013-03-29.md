 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 





Ramp;D has a tool called the [Future Future League](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/80) ([FFL](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/165) for short) where we play **Magic** as it will be a year into the future. Whenever I talk about the Future Future League, I always get the same question: "Why is it the Future Future League and not just the Future League?" The answer is that at first we had a Future League set six months into the future. Ramp;D soon realized that we weren't playing far enough into the future, that six months only gave us enough time to identify the problems but not enough time to fix them. Ramp;D solved this problem by making a league an additional six months into the future and dubbed it the Future Future League. I bring this up because today's topic is the New New World Order.
