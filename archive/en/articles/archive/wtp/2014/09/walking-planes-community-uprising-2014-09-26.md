Who's better at *Magic*? Wizards of the Coast or the *Magic* community? The people who make the game or the game's biggest fans? Let it be decided at the annual *Magic Online* Community Cup! With a variety of off-the-wall formats, including the infamous Ironroot Chef Challenge, the community and Wizards of the Coast duke it out for the most important trophy in the history of humankind. It's an event so fun, even evil babies love it!
