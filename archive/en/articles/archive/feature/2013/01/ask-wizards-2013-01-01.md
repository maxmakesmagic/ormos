Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!


 **Q:**  2013 is the 20th anniversary for **Magic**; what're you guys doing for it? - Tyson T. 


**A: Trick Jarrett, Editor-in-Chief of DailyMTG.com**


You're right! This year is **Magic**'s 20th anniversary. I won't dive into what we're doing but you will be seeing a number of related features, articles, and Arcanas on DailyMTG.com throughout this year.


**Q:** Why are there the weeks of reruns every year? â€”Mary L. 


**A: Trick Jarrett, Editor-in-Chief of DailyMTG.com**


Wizards of the Coast (and Hasbro) closes during the winter holidays, so for that reason it's important that the web team is permitted to take that time off as well. The easiest way for us to do that is to do the rerun content. Normally, we do it for two weeks, but this year we tried something different with **Magic Online** Week and then one week of reruns.
