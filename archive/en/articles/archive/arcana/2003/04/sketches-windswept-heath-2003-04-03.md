This week's "Sketches" looks at [Windswept Heath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) from *Onslaught*, a land that went through many changes. 


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Color: Land  
 Location: Between Wirewood Forest and Daru Plains  
 Action: where the plains of grass and dunes turn into the birch forest  
 Focus: elements of plains and elements of birch forest  
 Mood: life  
 Notes: Fetch Land Cycle. Reprint."


This description was written back when the fetchland cycle was just going to be a set of reprints of the *Mirage* fetchlands. This one was slated to be [Grasslands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasslands).


But after a bunch of swapping, the art commissioned for this piece ended up somewhere else, and the art that wound up on Windswept Heath was originally commissioned for what became [Daru Encampment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Encampment). Back then, the land was part of a cycle of lands that tapped for either of two colors of mana if you controlled a creature. This one was blue and white.


"Color: Land  
 Location: Daru Plains, Order encampment  
 Action: This is the coastal side of the Order encampment. The beach between the water and the encampment.  
 Focus: all  
 Mood:   
 Notes: Populated Land Cycle"


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch of that blue-white dual land submitted by Anthony S. Waters. 


By the time the sketch was submitted, R&D had already abandoned the dual lands for tribal lands and made Waters take the water out of the art. 


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. Note that Waters changed the palm tree in the foreground into a sort of totem. While this art could have worked for the Soldier land, it looked much better as the art of the new white-green fetchland, so it was moved from [Daru Encampment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Encampment) to [Windswept Heath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath).


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
