| WW: Weird, but I like it.
 BT: Me too. (Of course it’s my card. ;) )
 MR: What if we changed “target player” to “all players”
 TB: Wouldn’t that cause rules problems?
 MR: If the design team doesn’t create a rules problem or two, then we’ve failed as a team.
 WW: I still like “target player”
 MR: Could we change it from affecting just creatures to affecting all permanents?
 BT: Why do we have to change it?
 MR: It just doesn’t feel right.
 BT: Why not?
 MR: It’s missing some oomph.
 WW: I agree. Let’s change “creatures” to “permanents”.
 TB: Sure.
 BT: If everyone else wants to try it, okay. But if it doesn’t work, I want you all to promise to change it back.
 MR: Boy scout’s honor.
 TB: Hey, you were never a boy scout.
 MR: You don’t have to be a boy scout to have boy scout’s honor.
 WW: I actually think you do.
 MR: Fine. Card designer’s honor.
 WW: I don’t think card designers have any honor. :)
 MR: Ha ha. |
