Introducing the Magic Online Championship Field

 David works on the Magic community team as a content specialist. He spends his days writing about Magic Online and trying to play too many colors at once in Limited. 






The question of who is the best *Magic* player in your regular playgroup or local game store can be easily laid to rest via a series of no-holds-barred grudge matches. The question is: What do you do when your game store is impossibly huge, thousands of players show up to play every day—among them some of the greatest players in the world—and it's located inside the internet? The [*Magic Online* Championship Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2016-magic-online-championship-series) seeks to answers these hard-hitting questions.


The 2015 *Magic Online* Championship will take place from Friday, May 13, to Sunday, May 15, 2016!


When you sit down to a game in *Magic Online*, you'll often find yourself pitted against skilled players from far and wide. In any given game, you could be playing against someone who has been honing their *Magic* skills in mountain solitude for several years\*, the greatest thief in the Multiverse, or even someone who's MADE OF METAL—you just never know. From this pool of champions, a collection of the best players in the world come together once a year to decide who is truly the greatest player on *Magic Online*.


*\*Playing in mountain solitude requires a computer and an internet connection.*

None of this year's participants are made of metal (I don't *think*), but I assure you, they're all amazing *Magic* players. Let's meet this year's competitors!
