Are they stuck at the kitchen table while you're out meeting new friends, winning cool foil prize cards, and having truckloads\* of fun? With Event Decks, the can easily get involved!

But wait, maybe you're one of those players. Are you looking for a competitive deck right out of the box? Are you ready for truckloads\* of fun? With Event Decks, you can easily get involved!

Event Decks are designed to be strong, capable Standard-legal decks. If not being able to find the right deck is keeping you, or someone you know, home on Friday nights (or any other night your **Magic** community gathers), this may be just the deck you're looking for.

Each Event Deck is 60 cards, plus a 15-card sideboardâ€”ready for all of your dueling needs! Also included: a Spindown life counter and strategy guide to help pilot your deck to victory. Best of all, they'll be available on February 25, 2011, just in time for [*Mirrodin Besieged* Game Day](/en/articles/archive/announcing-mirrodin-besieged-2010-08-03) taking place on March 5-6!


> \* In scientific studies, Event Decks found to deliver 16.92 truckloads of fun. Actual results may vary.
