 With the first weekend of Grand Prix action over, it's time to take our first look of the new season at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. It's a measure of the success of our No. 1, Jérémy Dezani of France, that even winning [Grand Prix Portland](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppor14) last weekend leaves Owen Turtenwald, Reid Duke, and William Jensen unchanged at No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4, respectively. Their performance in Team Limited was almost unsurprising in its dominance, including a clash of the titans semifinal victory over Paul Cheon, Luis Scott-Vargas, and No.15 Eric Froehlich—who leaps up eight places as a result of his Top 4 finish in Portland.



The next biggest gainer from the Team Grand Prix was Japanese former Player of the Year Yuuya Watanabe. He rises four places to No. 7, passing Josh Utter-Leyton, Tom Martell, and Shaun McLaren in the process. Sam Black gained two places to No. 11, but you can expect to see a lot of volatility in that part of the table, with Watanabe at No. 7 all the way down to Rookie of the Year Jared Boettcher at No. 19 covered by a bare handful of points.



 Over in Europe, at [Grand Prix Utrecht](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gputr14), it was a quiet weekend, with many pros choosing to remain in Portland for the week following a tumultuous end-of-season Pro Tour. The champion from [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15), Ivan Floch, chose to take the weekend off, and he watched from the sidelines as former Austrian National Champion Oliver Polak-Rottmann became the first leader in this season's Player of the Year race. There's now a week to go before we discover which big names have been enticed to either Grand Prix Sydney for *Magic 2015* Limited, or to Kobe for another hugely popular Modern Grand Prix.




 Join us next week for more from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
