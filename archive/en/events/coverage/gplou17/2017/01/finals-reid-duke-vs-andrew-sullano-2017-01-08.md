When it comes to competitive *Magic,* Andrew Sullano is no slouch. He rocketed to the big stage with a top four finish at Grand Prix Oklahoma City in 2015 and is well-respected in the region surrounding his hometown of Dallas. He entered Grand Prix Louisville as a strong contender to do well, and a matchup most players would be happy to dodge through the tournament.


Sullano is a well-respected player. Reid Duke is a legend in his own time.


The world’s fifth-ranked player and 2011 *Magic Online* champion has two Pro Tour Top 8s to his name, along with a full 18 previous Grand Prix Top 8 appearances. A perennial contender for Player of the Year, Duke had rattled off a perfect 6-0 run on Sunday to advance to the Top 8, where he had taken down the reigning world champion Brian Braun-Duin in the semifinals.


**The Decks**


Things change slowly in Legacy, as you might expect given that the cards legal in the format stretch back more than 20 years. But both Duke and Sullano brought relatively new decks to the table — Sullano on Black-Red Reanimator and Duke on an innovative build of Sultai that took full advantage of newcomer [Leovold, Emissary of Trest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leovold%2C+Emissary+of+Trest). Leovold was all over the room this weekend, and it was no surprise to see it make its way into the finals.

Sullano’s Reanimator deck was more unexpected. Despite putting up a Top 8 appearance at Eternal Weekend several months back, the deck wasn’t a major force across the room in Louisville. Not that it stopped Sullano, who powered through the Top 8 on the back of potential first-turn [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) or [Sire of Insanity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sire+of+Insanity). The explosiveness of the deck was unmatched, though fighting through [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) all day is no cakewalk for anything.


**The Games**


The finals began, and for Sullano, so too did the mulligans. The first game saw him go all the way down to four cards, though that four was almost as good as he could hope for. [Chancellor of the Annex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Annex), [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). If the top of his deck cooperated, Sullano’s hand could actually get there.


Things started off well, as he scried a [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) to the top of the deck, allowing him to cast [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) on his first turn. In response, Duke fetched a [Tropical Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island), paid one for the revealed Chancellor tax, and then returned the land to [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) the [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize).


“I suppose this might not work out, but I’m going to [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) you," Reid said as he cast his own discard spell.


All it, did however, was elicit a sigh from Sullano, who [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed a [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) but lost the [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) from his hand. With his options now limited to the top of his deck, Sullano was forced to watch hopelessly as [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) picked up an Umezawa’s Jitte and sent Reid to the win two turns later.


If Game 1 displayed the weaknesses of playing a combo deck, the second game was a clear demonstration of its strengths as Sullano opted to play first and made the most of his opportunity.


Reveal [Chancellor of the Annex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Annex). Play [Bayou](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bayou) and cast [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal). [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) up to three mana, [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) for [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) and then [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) to bring it into play. Even if Duke had been sitting on [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), it would be useless to him thanks to the Chancellor trigger.

All Duke could do was play a land as he took a hit from [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand). While he did manage to [Flusterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flusterstorm) a [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) from Sullano on his turn, another seven cards courtesy of [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) was enough to return a [Tidespout Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidespout+Tyrant) to play and send the pair into a decider.


Again Sullano was forced to mulligan, this time to five cards with only one land among them. Things went from bad to worse when Duke led off with [Nihil Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) alongside [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). While Sullano missed his second land drop and tried to plan around the Spellbomb, Duke deployed [Leovold, Emissary of Trest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leovold%2C+Emissary+of+Trest), for the first time in the match.


Low on resources but with no other choice, Sullano [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) and cast [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) when he found his second land two turns later. That forced Duke to pop the Spellbomb, and while it represented wasted resources on Sullano’s part it at least cleared the way for a second try.


He tried. [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) allowed him to discard both Elesh Norn and [Tidespout Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidespout+Tyrant), giving him the chance to discard one of Duke’s cards, kill a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and drain some life to boot.


The only problem? [Leovold, Emissary of Trest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leovold%2C+Emissary+of+Trest). Because the Brutality targeted both Duke and his creature, he was able to immediately draw two cards before casting [Mindbreak Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindbreak+Trap) to counter the Brutality. A third [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) hit the table for Duke, and suddenly the Leovold was swinging for six damage a turn.


With one last gasp, Sullano tried for another [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) on Elesh Norn. But once again, Duke had the [Mindbreak Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindbreak+Trap). When the counterspell hit the table Sullano’s hand hit the air to meet his opponent’s, and he congratulated Duke on becoming the champion of Grand Prix Louisville.
