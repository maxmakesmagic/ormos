The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 12, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Zombie Sphinx.](#1)


Today's Previews
================


Every day until the full set is revealed on April 14, I'll be sharing all the non-DailyMTG previews you can find around the web in this space. Here are today's:


1. [Zombie Sphinx Time! *Amonkhet* 先行プレビュー – KaiGuyMTG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAXTHWxxMQQ&feature=youtu.be) | Tokyomtg.com

Yes, it's a video in Japanese, but there are subtitles. Genius!


But in case subtitles aren't your thing, you can skip the line and go straight to [a community translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/64x6l3/akhzombie_sphinx/dg5olr0/), which is spot on.


Oh, and that Zombie Sphinx token? It looks a little something like this:

Also behold, Bontu the Glorified in *Invocation* form!

Now [this is how you do a translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/64y4wo/ahk_sweltering_suns_german_preview_translation_in/dg5ut56/)! This is also very much how you do a red sweeper that you're happy to main deck all day long.

So, I may have gotten a little bit of a taste for trolling pros with previews in *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*. Someday I may stop. That day is not today.

The real treat is the puzzle you have to solve to get the preview card. It's like Mark Rosewater is some kind of riddle-based being. Whatever those might be called.


1. Magic Mics | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | Evan Erwin, Reuben Bresler, and Erin Campbell | 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT/3 a.m. UTC | **Coming Soon**

That's a lot of introductory text to tell you that Magic Mics has more preview cards coming during tonight's show. Come for the preview cards, stay for Evan getting really excited about something.

1. Nass and Pardee's Big Move

Team tournaments are good to Matt Nass and Sam Pardee. Often seen teaming together, the pair made the biggest moves of the week after a stellar Grand Prix Mexico City, and now both find themselves in the Top 15—Pardee up nine spots and Nass up seven. The only other player to jump up this week was Martin Jůza, who has also put up some strong results as of late.

Synergy of the Day
==================


1. Perfect Information

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_z0MVaI8OhW.png)![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_w08Rh46uHS.png)


When I saw the synergy between these two powerhouses, I'll admit, I got a little tingly. These two synergize so well, I keep uncovering new ways they work together.


Let's start simple. The Vizier lets you look at the top of your library at any time. That, in turn, lets you know if your Nissa will hit if you use her zero ability. If not, you can plus her to scry.


Now, scrying, in turn, will help you churn creatures to the top of your library to cast them with Vizier of the Menagerie.


Sometimes, however, you'll hit lands on top of your library. No problem! Vizier of the Menagerie actually wants you to have a bunch of mana in play so that you can cast multiple creatures from the top of your library, and Nissa is pretty good at putting lands into play from the top of your library, no matter what her loyalty is at.


Now get brewing!


Fan-Submitted Synergy
=====================


1. Crewing Dreadnoughts with Gods

I received a fan-submitted synergy from [@donr484](https://twitter.com/donr484) that seemed worth sharing. Though his aim was looking at Commander (or other older formats), there's a Standard gem in there too!


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Consulate+Dreadnought)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consulate+Dreadnought)
![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_UXU8xtwyEi.png)


Consulate Dreadnought is intentionally very difficult to crew—but not for a God! Rhonas only needs the help of one single power to get the Dreadnought fired up, something that should be relatively easy. Turn one Consulate Dreadnought, turn two literally any creature with at least 1 power, turn three Rhonas, and you're attacking with a 7/11 on your third turn. Live the dream, people. It's a beautiful dream.
