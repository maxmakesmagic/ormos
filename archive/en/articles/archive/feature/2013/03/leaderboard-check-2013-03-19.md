The guilds of Ravnica are still racing on [PlaneswalkerPoints.com](http://www.planeswalkerpoints.com). Hopefully you've joined the race by picking your guild on [PlaneswalkerPoints.com](http://www.planeswalkerpoints.com). Doing so joins your points to your guild of choice and allows you to earn guild related achievements!


It's been a few months since we checked in on how the guilds are doing, so here's how [the leaderboard](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/Guild) looks:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guild | Members | Points |
| Izzet | 12,297 | 2,967,360 |
| Azorius | 10,980 | 2,955,458 |
| Dimir | 11,243 | 2,152,657 |
| Simic | 8,868 | 1,919,836 |
| Golgari | 7,718 | 1,442,450 |
| Boros | 9,065 | 1,348,532 |
| Orzhov | 7,089 | 1,276,046 |
| Selesnya | 7,056 | 1,220,732 |
| Rakdos | 5,802 | 1,063,959 |
| Gruul | 4,021 | 740,678 |

That's over 17 Million Planeswalker Points between all ten guilds of Ravnica! And with *Dragon's Maze* there are a lot more points to enter the ring, so if you haven't yet you should definitely go pick your guild!


As you can see the Izzet guild remains at the top with the largest roster and the most points earned. Let's take a look at how the guilds rank when ordered by the number of points per member of the guild.


 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Guild | Points
 Per Member |
| Azorius | 269.17 |
| Izzet | 241.31 |
| Simic | 216.49 |
| Dimir | 191.47 |
| Golgari | 186.89 |
| Gruul | 184.20 |
| Rakdos | 183.39 |
| Orzhov | 180.00 |
| Selesnya | 173.00 |
| Boros | 148.76 |

So who's passing and who's failing? Well if we take the total amount of points out there and divide by the total number of players who have signed up for a guild, we get 203.09 points. Using this metric it means that just Azorius, Izzet and Simic are above average, everyone else needs to really step it up!


How is your guild doing? Are you doing your part to support them?
