 Having overcome the self-described indomitable luck of Andrea Mengucci in his Quarterfinal match, Nam Sung Wook already defeated a Red-Green Elspeth deck today. Junk Constellation, with its ability to draw cards, remove threat, and use [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) defensively were a powerful duo that proved the difference for Nam throughout the weekend: It's exactly how he had dispatched Mengucci in the Quarterfinals.



Yuuki Ichikawa, in addition to his choice to deck, was in a similar position as Mengucci. Earning his way to the Pro Tour from a PTQ and finding himself in his first Pro Tour Top 8, the up-and-coming Japanese player Japanese player deviated from their similarities in one crucial way: He defeated No. 2 Ranked Player Reid Duke in his Semifinal match. Red-Green Elspeth may have been a popular, known quantity but that didn't make it less effective.





*Yuuki Ichikawa's Red-Green Elspeth deck has been a force all weekend. Nam Sung Wook dispatched one in the Quarterfinals, however. Could he do it again?*
