This week's "Sketches" looks at one of the black commons from *Onslaught*, [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) by Danny Orizio.


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Aphetto City. Action: a swarm of Zombie hands (some with arms or tendons trailing) crawling through the city."


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Danny. The problem was that he showed the hands coming up through the ground as if they were still attached to bodies. The folks here didn't want that; they just wanted some wandering hands.


The new sketch showed what was intended: a bunch of hands roaming the streets. Now the only thing R&D wanted was for there to be *more* hands.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. Danny squeezed a couple more small hands into the background.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
