With [the return of the Pro Tour](https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-your-path-to-playing-magic-at-the-highest-level), the qualification routes from *Magic Online* to Premier tournaments are changing.


At a high level, much of what you enjoy about *Magic Online* Premier tournaments are staying the same. The *Magic Online* Champions Showcase, Qualifiers and Super Qualifiers, and Challenges are all staying roughly the sameâ€”only now they'll plug into the larger tabletop ecosystem as well!


Starting with the now underway 2022 *Magic Online* Champions Showcase Season 2, players who qualify for the final eight-player Showcase event will also earn invitations to the Pro Tour. So, if you win a Showcase Qualifier or Showcase Open event or earn one of the two at-large spots from the Leaderboard, you qualify for the Pro Tour.


But wait, there's more! Both the winner and the runner-up of the Showcase event will earn direct invitations to the World Championship to be held in 2023!


Meanwhile, Qualifiers and Super Qualifiers on *Magic Online* will switch to giving top finishers invitations to the next Regional Championship event. We will have additional details and schedules for these tournaments closer to the start of regional qualifications in July.


During May and June, Showcase Challenges will serve as the main method of using your Qualifier Points. Because those are all Constructed formats, we are developing a way for Limited aficionados to play in events using QPs as well.


Look for information on these events in our Weekly Announcement Blog at [MTGO.com](https://mtgo.com/) in the coming weeks.
