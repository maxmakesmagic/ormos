Last week, [we met our first four participants](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/290) in the *Magic Online* Championship. Our next six hail from three separate continents and five separate countries. We want you to get to know our participants a bit better, so without further ado, here are Bruno, Bing, Anssi, Hannes, Seth, and Lars!

### Bing Luke


**Hometown:** Brooklyn, NY  
**Occupation:** Tax Attorney


**When did you start playing *Magic Online*?**   

I picked up *Magic Online* during Ravnica, when I saw someone playing and remembered how much I loved playing *Magic*.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**   

Two-time previous MOCS finalist (2010, 2011), playing my fifth sanctioned match of *Magic* against Hall-of-Famer Olivier Ruel at Worlds with a sub-1600 rating.


**Favorite draft format and why?**  

Triple *Lorwyn* was the most fun to play the actual games because you could get the most broken decks. The more recent sets (triple *Innistrad* and *Theros* in particular) are probably better during the actual draft, since the playable cards and archetypes are both deeper, giving you more decisions.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**   
[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). It rewards knowledge of the format, how specific matchups play out, and what cards are or aren't important. It's especially rewarding making blind Therapies based on an opponent's turn-one land drop.


I would otherwise have said [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), but there is no other card worse at making both players feel awful about their decisions.


**What is your biggest *Magic* weakness?**   

I often go for quantity over quality of play. It's hard to improve at *Magic* if you are jumping between games or immediately joining another queue. So much of improvement is stopping to think of what you did right, what you did wrong, and what you could have done differently.


**What thought ran through your head as soon as you realized you were going to the *Magic Online* Championship?**   

I had recently returned from vacation, so was mostly still jetlagged and sleep-deprived. Firsthand reports say I jumped up and immediately started running around the house.

### Anissi Alkio


**Hometown:** Helsinki, Finland  
**Occupation:** Student


**Where did you or are you going to school?**  

Aalto School of Economics


**Who do you live with?**  

Alone. :(


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**   

Reading comics; Korean webtoons are great.


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**   
*Onslaught* Block. *Scourge* was my first Prerelease.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**   
[Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptbng14/welcome), 4th. A lot in other, now dead, TCGs.


**Favorite draft format and why?**  
*Ravnica*/*Guildpact*. Nothing beats [Brainspoil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainspoil)ing into [Izzet Chronarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Chronarch) to return [Ribbons of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ribbons+of+Night) to your hand.


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**   

It would be nice, I guess.


**What format do you think you will do BEST at and why?**  

Cube and Modern. Those formats let you be creative.


**What is your spirit animal?**  

A small bird who flies freely and does whatever it wants.

### Hannes Kerem


**Hometown:** Keila, Estonia  
**Occupation:** Foorball Trader


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**   

Football (the real one) and basketball.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**   

Worlds 2008 Top 8, GP Moscow Top 8, four Nationals Top 8s, World *Magic* Cup Top 8, two previous *Magic Online* ChampionshipTop 8s.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**   
[Timbermaw Larva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timbermaw+Larva). The best common ever in the right deck.


Or [Blood of the Martyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+of+the+Martyr) because of art.


**What single card do you have the most of in your *Magic Online* collection?**   

377 [Timbermaw Larva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timbermaw+Larva)


**What is your biggest *Magic* weakness?**   

Horrible luck in opening mythic rares.


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**  

I think if I Top 8 this event I am the only one that has Top 8ed every premier tournament type.


**What format do you think you will do BEST at and why?**  

My best results have usually been in Standard, so that, probably.


**What is your spirit animal?**  

Donkey.

### Lars Dam


**Hometown:** Gentofte, Denmark  
**Occupation:** Poker Player


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**   

At age fifteen. My brother started collecting a bit before I got into it. My first deck was a forty-card blue-red land destruction deck with [Phantasmal Terrain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Terrain) and [Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain).


**When did you start playing *Magic Online*?**   

I don't remember exactly when it was introduced, but I started playing with a friend a few months after it launched (IPA and OTJ drafts). We had the highest Limited rating on *Magic Online* at one point back then (different account than the one I'm using now).


**Favorite format to play and why?**  

Team Rochester Draft, then Team Sealed. Most fun and skill-intensive formats. Drafts aren't bad, either, and I enjoy regular Sealed too. Haven't really liked Standard since the focus shift to all midrange creature decks. Modern is fine since there is enough variation to make it interesting.


**What does your normal day of *Magic* look like?**   

Play Release Events or draft. I'm pretty conscious about playing the higher events that don't require me to spend eight or more hours at a time, although drafts aren't great but they are fast, which is nice.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**   
[Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb) and [Rising Waters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rising+Waters); I like breaking the symmetry of the cards. For Limited, it would be [Imagecrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter) and [Tidal Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidal+Visionary); both are really nice and tricky to play with and against.


**How are you preparing for the *Magic Online* Championship? Who are you practicing with?**   

I'm watching some twitch streams and drafting; that's all I have done so far. I will probably start playing some Constructed in the last week up to the event.


**What is your spirit animal?**  

Animal story: I once had five puppies. I had to move them out of my house during a draft because of a wild snake's sudden appearance. I can't draft and catch snakes at the same time as watching puppies. So I put the puppies in a box and ran next door with them then back and finished drafting while I made sure the snake didn't make further progress into the house. Then during deck building the snake and I agreed it was better for the snake to be outside again and the puppies had grown tired of sitting in a box so they got back home. I won that draft but I don't think I'm associating myself in particular with an animal while playing *Magic*. :)
