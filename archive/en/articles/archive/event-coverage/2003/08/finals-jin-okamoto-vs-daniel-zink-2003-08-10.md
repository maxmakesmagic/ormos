This is it. Eighteen rounds. Three formats. Weeks of preparation. Everything crystallized into this one match. Best of five games, winner take all.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a454.jpg)It'll be a doozy, too. The dreaded Wake mirror. A war of attrition of card-drawing and mana. Both these two know their way around it. Daniel Zink bested Jeroen Remie in the quarters, and Okamoto got the better of Nieminen in the semis. It's been a tough haul. Never mind that these two players have been working their hardest mental game all weekend, and have spent the day under the hot stage lights, they've got to dig deep and come up with the concentration to pull out just one more win.

Both have their strong resumes. Zink is a former German National Champion with a Top 4 at Euros under his belt. Okamoto is a former Asia-Pacific Champion. Both are enjoying their first Tour Top 8, something all the sweeter for Okamoto after his heartbreaking near misses at 2001 Worlds and 2002 Los Angeles.

With all cameras poised on them, they got down to business.

### Game 1

Zink kept a hand with [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), but no blue source. He had three lands, and had to rely on the top of his deck. Okamoto led with Verge while Zink's deck served up uncastable blue spells. Before things could get dire, though, Zink found an island and busted out [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Okamoto [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed it. He made no play on his turn, and let Zink untap. Zink flashed back his Analysis. Okamoto cracked his Verge. He tried an Analysis of his own, but Zink was ready with a Leak. Okamoto returned the favor when Zink hard-cast another Analysis.

Both players flashed their spells back. Zink was choking on a hand full of gas. He had only six land to work with. He had to discard one of his excess [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)s. Both players cycled [Renewed Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith)s. Finally, Zink broke the monotony with a [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Okamoto played a [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) on his turn, and Zink played a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to tighten his mana. Then he played [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), which got him a [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) to keep the Wake off the board. He played one of his own, tapping out but for an island.

Okamoto untapped and played [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). His two cards only served to deepen the furrow in his brow. He flashed the Analysis back. Still nothing. He played a Verge and was done. Zink was delighted to get to untap. He kept his mana free for the turn. Okamoto did the same, and just nodded when Zink made thirteen tokens with a cycled [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice). He stalled their attack with the discarded Peace, and Zink was fine with that.

Okamoto worked his [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), and then tried a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). Zink dug two cards down, then let it happen. Holding another Decree in hand, he wasn't worried. He made eleven men at the end of Okamoto's turn. It could be over if Okamoto didn't have the Peace. Of course, you don't get this far without a little bit of luck. Okamoto had another Peace. He untapped and played a second [Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath). Zink [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)ed twice and dropped [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). Okamoto showed him [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Zink dug a little more, then abandoned it in favor of shooting down Okamoto's [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Okamoto drew a card off it, and the board cleared. With both Decrees managed, Zink would have to bank all his hopes on his [Hunting Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Pack). Okamoto played [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), tapping out and giving Zink free reign.

His pace quickened noticeably. He started with a second Wake. Then a third. He tore through his deck with [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). He stopped with five lands open. Okamoto untapped and played a Wake of his own. Zink [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)ed four times. He was holding [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), but waiting on it. Then he went through another four. Still more useless lands and [Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath)s. His library was growing slim. The Wake resolved. Next came [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), for [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation). Two of Zink's Wakes hit the bin. Okamoto flashed back his Analysis.

Zink shook his head at the size of his library, and kept digging. He finally found [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), and played it with five mana open. Okamoto put his head in his hands and started thinking. Only seven cards remained in Zink's library. Okamoto [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic)ed. Zink stared at the [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) in his hand. He activated [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) came off the top! It practically leapt onto the board, and Okamoto accepted it after some thought. Zink's [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) resolved. All Okamoto could do was cycle a [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) for four men.

He untapped and played a third Wake. Zink's life total was fifteen, still not enough. He cycled a pair of [Renewed Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith)s and then smashed in. Zink happily fell to three. Between Wake, [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) and the [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) in his hand he could start doing some ridiculous things. He gave it back to Okamoto, who played [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and started digging. He found a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and played it. Zink responded with one of his own, copied through the [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). Okamoto [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)ed twice and then played a second [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). Zink let it resolve. It got [Ray of Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Distortion), which in turn shot down the [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). It was flashed back to axe the Wake. Zink got in his [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) while the getting was good. He cycled with [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), leaving four cards left in his library, and nine mana in his pool. He put the Wake in the graveyard. Okamoto [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed the Wish Copy. Zink paid. He played the last card in his hand, another Lead. Zink paid again, leaving a green, a blue, and a white in his pool.

Finally, someone got to resolve [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). Zink's copy got a real Wish. His first Wish got [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), countering Okamoto's Wish. Zink [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)ed. Then he untapped. He paused during his upkeep to Wish for [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation), and [Reclaim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim)ed [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) and [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). He drew [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), and passed it back to Okamoto. He fogged the attack and then put two Wakes back into his deck. He drew one of them. He tapped all but four lands for Wake and [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). Okamoto cycled a [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice), making far too many soldiers. It didn't matter. He didn't have anything left in his deck that could stop Zink. He cycled to the last card, then extended the hand. The exhausted spectators erupted into applause. The marathon game had taken over an hour.

"I promise the games go faster after sideboarding." – Daniel Zink

### Game 2

One of Zink's sideboarded Brushhoppers got into play on the third turn and started beating. Both players played [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), and Okamoto's Wake was busted up by [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation). Okamoto played another Analysis from hand. Zink did the same, bashing while he did so. Okamoto, at ten, resolved a [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Zink brought him to seven, then matched his enchantment. It looked like his prophecy would come true, to the delight of the local fans.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a455.jpg)Okamoto played a [Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath), and then [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle)d the Brushhopper's activation. It was a reprieve. He flashed back a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) to go to four. Zink played a morphed Angel, but he only had one [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), not enough to stop Okamoto's [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). Zink made no move on his turn. Okamoto flashed back his [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), falling to three. Zink cycled a [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice), nervously licking his lips while Okamoto dug with [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) for a [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle). When none came, Okamoto simply picked up his cards. 

Zink 2 – Okamoto 0

### Game 3

Both player matched Verges on the first turn, and then matched [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)s. They played their third lands and stared at each other. Okamoto declined to pop his Verge, fronting a possible [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) in hand. Zink needed that Verge to go off, as he was without white mana. He put that problem on the back burner, and played [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). No white source came. Okamoto sacrificed his Verge.

On his turn he had six mana, and got ready to punish. [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) got [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) and destroyed Zink's [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). A lone island screamed [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle). Zink ripped a [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) off the top, getting the white mana he needed for the Wake and two Rays in his hand. He blew up Okamoto's [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and passed it back. Both players visibly settled in for a long game.

Okamoto had nothing to do but cycle a [Renewed Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith) on his turn. Zink Analyzed again. But then, a backbreaker from Okamoto! Catching Zink with just two mana untapped, he was able to resolve [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). Better still, Zink had no [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) in hand to fetch [Ray of Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Distortion). He untapped and thought, finally dropping [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) in defiance of Okamoto's Ray in the graveyard. He flashed back an Analysis and moved to discard. Okamoto of course got rid of his Wake.

So now Okamoto had a turn with Zink nearly tapped out. He copied a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), getting [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation). He had nothing further. Zink made an [Anurid Brushhopper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Brushhopper), and still Okamoto made no move. Zink Analyzed. At the end of his turn Okamoto copied a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). Zink played one of his own, getting [Ray of Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Distortion). Okamoto got [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), and then [Flash of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+of+Insight).

He made no play on his turn. Zink swung in, and then considered his options. He made no play. Okamoto played a [Flash of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+of+Insight) and [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari)'d it, tapping out. Zink played [Ray of Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Distortion) on the [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), let the copy resolve, and then [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed the original. Okamoto untapped and played [Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath). Zink's hand was so good that he just let his Brushhopper die. He soon replaced it with a morph, no prizes for guessing which one. Okamoto had another [Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath), but Zink had [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), and succeeded in keeping his monster alive. Okamoto played [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and was done. Zink flipped up his Angel and started to serve.

He tried to speed things up with a cycled [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice), but Okamoto had the [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle). Okamoto tried to [Chastise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chastise) the Angel via [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), but Zink had the [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Okamoto fell to eight. He played a [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) for two Angels. He went down to four flashing back a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Zink Leaked it. He untapped and morphed a second Angel, readying the killing blow.

Okamoto flashed back his [Flash of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash+of+Insight), then untapped and played an Analysis from hand. He flashed it back, going to one. Zink tried to end the game then and there with [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice), but it was [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle)d. He played and replayed a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), then thought hard about his situation. He attacked with a single Angel, trading it for one of Okamoto's. Okamoto played a Wake, but Zink had the [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a445.jpg)He hit again, with the remaining Angel. Okamoto chumped. He [Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath)ed on his turn. Zink tried a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), but it was [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic)'d. He untapped and made [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Okamoto dropped a Ray at end of turn. Okamoto wouldn't go quietly. He rose to seven with a [Renewed Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith) on his turn, and then flashed back the remaining Analysis.

Zink was ready to end it. He tapped three for [Anurid Brushhopper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Brushhopper). Okamoto dusted it with [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Zink tapped five for [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), leaving eight remaining. Okamoto Leaked. Zink paid. He Leaked again. Zink paid. As Okamoto tapped all but one lands to [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) a third time, a murmur went through the crowd. Before it could take hold, Zink snapped down a Leak of his own, tapping his last two mana. The murmurs became applause, and then cheers.

Okamoto tapped all but one land in a last-ditch gambit, making five angels with [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice). Zink untapped and showed him [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). He copied a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), getting a Wish and then [Hunting Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Pack), going for the throat. He gave it back to Okamoto with seven mana up. Okamoto looked at his two cards and shook his head. He ended his turn. Zink copied another Wish, getting a Wish and [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation). Okamoto played a Wish of his own, for [Ray of Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Distortion), shutting down the [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). Soon he dropped the Pack, and Okamoto had no answer. The crowd, on the edge of their seat since the [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) resolved, blew the roof off the house with their applause. Daniel Zink was the 2003 World Champion!

**Final Result:** Daniel Zink defeats Jin Okamoto 3-0
