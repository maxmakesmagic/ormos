Let's hit a few highlights. To the right, we've got a sample chapter of *Zendikar: In the Teeth of the Akoum*. Note that it's a sample chapter, even though it looks like it might be the full book in the picture there. It actually looks like this:

There's also, of course, a spindown counter and eight boosters. For a better look at the boosters, check out [yesterday's Arcana](/en/articles/archive/rise-eldrazi-booster-packs-2010-03-10).

There's also a storage box, the wraparound mural, a player's puide, and forty *Rise of the Eldrazi* basic land.
