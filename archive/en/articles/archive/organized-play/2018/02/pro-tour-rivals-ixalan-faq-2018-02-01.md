PRO TOUR *RIVALS OF IXALAN* BASICS
==================================


Here are the key points to know about Pro Tour *Rivals of Ixalan* if you're new or just getting back into watching a *Magic* event like this:


* The Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring some of greatest *Magic* pros as well as top-finishing Grand Prix competitors, Hall of Famers, and players who found success in last August's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers. Those players will be competing for a share of the $250,000 prize pool, with $50,000 going to the winner along with an invitation to the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.
* Pro Tour *Rivals of Ixalan* is the second Pro Tour of the 2017–18 season, and the second event for the Pro Tour Team Series, with six new teams joining up a little late to make their mark on the season. For a look at where the teams stand headed into this event, check out the [2017–18 leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/protour/teamseries/2017-18-leaderboard).
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using two *Rivals of Ixalan* packs and one pack of *Ixalan*, in that order—and five rounds of Modern Constructed. All matches on Friday and Saturday are best two out of three games.
* Modern is a robust Constructed format, featuring every card printed from *Eighth Edition* back on July 28, 2003, all the way to the most recent release, *Rivals of Ixalan*. Modern also boasts a [banned list](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/banned-restricted), meaning players cannot use any card on that list in the Modern deck that they register.
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of the first day will advance to Day Two of the competition.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a traditional single-elimination bracket.
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action.
* The winner gets $50,000, Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club through March 24, 2019, and an invitation to compete in the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.
* The $250,000 prize pool pays down to 64th place, awarding a minimum of $1,000. In addition, all players with 33 or more match points at the end of the Pro Tour's Swiss rounds will receive an invitation to compete in the next Pro Tour.
