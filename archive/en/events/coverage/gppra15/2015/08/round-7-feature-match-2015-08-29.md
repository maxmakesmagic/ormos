Peter Vieren's biggest success so far had been a Top 8 at Grand Prix Lyon in 2010, while Hannes Kerem could look back on a semifinals finish at the 2008 World Championship. So it was about time, for both of them, to get another good result. They each had a loss already and were looking to avoid another, though of course only one of them could.


Kerem was playing the ubiquitous Hangarback Abzan, Vieren had brought a somewhat less popular deck in Blue-Black Control.


**The Games**


Kerem got off to an unusually slow start with [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) being his first play and [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes) his second. Both never made it to the battlefield though, thanks to [Clash of Wills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Wills) and [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), respectively.

[Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) caught [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) met [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes) ran into [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) â€¦ Vieren seemed to have all the answers, partly thanks to a [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) squeezed in between. He even had the perfect foil for when [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) left behind a number of Thopter tokens: [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death).


**Peter Vieren 1-0 Hannes Kerem**


In the second game, things began with a mulligan for Vieren and a [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) for Kerem. [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) came next, and when Kerem followed it up with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) he saw a hand with one [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and lands.

Now left without any spell at all, it didn't take Vieren long to concede and pick up his cards.


**Peter Vieren 1-1 Hannes Kerem**


In the beginning of game three, [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) and a pair of [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve)s took care of a face-down [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector), a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), and [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes). But Kerem's [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) stuck around, dealt some damage, and grew to 4/4 before eventually dying to [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall).


Meanwhile, Vieren restocked with [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). He then killed the Thopters as well as a freshly-summoned [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) with [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish). For the [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) which followed he had [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault), and finally Kerem found himself without further threats.


Another [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) dug up one of the few threats Vieren had in his deck. [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) was later joined by [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), then [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar), while Kerem resigned himself to the inevitable.


"Yeah, I don't think I have any outs," said Kerem and extended his hand.


**Peter Vieren 2-1 Hannes Kerem**
