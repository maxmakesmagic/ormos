Mike Cannon signed on to write From the Lab at the end of 2012. An ardent casual player and lover of bizarre synergies, he'll be bringing you a selection of crazy combo decks every Monday.


September 29, 2014
 










Hello, dear laboratorians. Please, come in. Have a seat. Now, you're probably wondering why I've gathered you all here today. The reason is simple.


Abzan Week!



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/cardart_AbzanAscendancy.jpg)

[Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) | Art by [Mark Winters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Mark+Winters%22])



That's right, it's time to dig into the clan of endurance and see what sort of junk we can find. Although the Abzan appear to be relatively simple folk, there's definitely more than meets the eye here. For every chunk of mountain you see poking above the sand, there's ten times that hidden beneath the surface. Wait, that's icebergs. That analogy doesn't fit at all. No matter, let's get down to business.


The Bark is Worse than the Bite
===============================



 One of the first Abzan cards that caught my eye was [Kin-Tree Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Invocation). While it doesn't technically bear a clan watermark, the name as well as the sandy ghost warrior in the art make it clear that this is not a card that represents the Sultai. Glass! That's the analogy I should have used! Sand looks dull and boring but you can use it to make glass. That works much better.




 Anyway, [Kin-Tree Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Invocation) obviously wants creatures with high toughness. You know who else likes creatures with high toughness? [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower). Doran was Abzan before Abzan existed, and yet he still manages to exemplify the idea of endurance that is so central to the clan.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Doran, the Siege Tower)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran, the Siege Tower)








 Now we just need some creatures with high toughness. A traditional Doran deck would take advantage of cards like [Indomitable Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Ancients), but this is From the Lab. Why settle for 10 toughness when we can have several trillion? The combo I'm using here is an old one, and there's actually a surprising amount of redundancy in the pieces that never really showed itself in tournament decks.




[Daru Spiritualist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Spiritualist) gives any Cleric you control, including itself, an extra 2 toughness when it becomes the target of a spell or ability. Combine that with a card with a free activated ability that targets, such as [Shuko](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shuko), and you can have as much toughness as you want. Now, traditionally, this was used with something like [Starlit Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlit+Sanctum) to gain an arbitrarily large amount of life, but we already have some great ways to take advantage of all that toughness.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Daru Spiritualist)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru Spiritualist)


[Daru Spiritualist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Spiritualist)'s ability isn't unique. In fact, both [Task Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Task+Force) and [Angelic Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Protector) can get the job done just as well, albeit for a bit more mana. On the targeting side, [Nomads en-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomads+en-Kor) would be the old-school combo piece, but by using Equipment we can make the combo a bit less vulnerable. [Umbral Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umbral+Mantle) and [Grafted Wargear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Wargear) can handle the targeting just fine, so long as you remember not to equip the Wargear to another creature. You can still target the equipped creature over and over again without triggering the Wargear's sacrifice ability.




 With a bit of space left in the deck, I decided to shore up the finisher part of the deck. [Scourge of Skola Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Skola+Vale) can sacrifice an infinitely tough creature to give you an enormous threat with trample for the following turn. If finishing off your opponent isn't an option, you can use [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) to gain a few million life after attacking with [Daru Spiritualist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Spiritualist) or an equivalent. It can also be used to prevent you from dying before you get everything set up by getting rid of an attacker in exchange for an irrelevant amount of life.

Just When I Thought I Was Out
=============================



 For my purposes, the most interesting card in almost every clan is the accompanying Ascendancy. [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) is no different, with a pair of powerful abilities just ripe for abuse. The first ability is fairly simple, and is something we've seen many times on cards like [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) and [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township). The second ability isn't exactly new either, with a direct predecessor in [Field of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+of+Souls).




 However, [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) costs one less than just about every equivalent for either ability, and it puts both together on one card. I went through a number of ideas for decks using the Ascendancy, but in the end I decided to take advantage of the second ability's synergy with another pre-Abzan wedge card: [Karador, Ghost Chieftain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karador%2C+Ghost+Chieftain).






[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Abzan Ascendancy)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan Ascendancy)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Karador, Ghost Chieftain)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karador, Ghost Chieftain)








 The plan is to cast a creature from the graveyard each turn and immediately sacrifice it, getting some effect when it enters the battlefield or dies. With [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy), you'll get a Spirit token each time you do it.




 To make sure you have access to a Karador each game, I've included [Fierce Empath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath). In addition to being a three-mana tutor for Karador, it can be cast from the graveyard afterward to get something else.



Normally, Karador would cost eight mana to cast, but that cost is reduced for each creature in your graveyard. To help make that happen, I'll include some ways to fill the graveyard directly as well as a few creatures that can be sacrificed early in the game for some effect.



[Buried Alive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) is the gold standard for filling your graveyard with dudes. In this deck, it effectively gives you your three best creatures in your hand for three mana, which is absolutely insane. For when you don't have three mana to spare, [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) can be a [Demonic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor) for half the mana. Note that it can also get noncreature cards, which could be relevant depending on what you have in your hand and graveyard.




[Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Diligent Farmhand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent+Farmhand) can get you extra lands on the battlefield while also putting extra creatures in your graveyard. As far as Karador is concerned, these guys basically give you a permanent boost of two mana. Also, [Diligent Farmhand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent+Farmhand) counts as a [Muscle Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst), which is just plain cool.






[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Buried Alive)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried Alive)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Diligent Farmhand)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent Farmhand)








[Fleshbag Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshbag+Marauder) is a [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) that you can cast every single turn if you want, making it hard for your opponent to build up any significant battlefield presence. If you need a more precise strike, [Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) can do the job, although it won't conveniently put itself back in the graveyard. To solve that, [Altar of Dementia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Dementia) and [Phyrexian Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Tower) give you a way to sacrifice your creatures at any time. [Altar of Dementia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Dementia) doubles as a way to fill your graveyard early in the game, and can even be used as a win condition if the Spirit tokens aren't getting it done.




[Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star) gives you a massive life swing and, when sacrificed multiple times, it can be almost impossible to come back from. It also gives the deck an easy way to win multiplayer games. If you're more interested in not losing than winning, [Sunblast Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblast+Angel) is a safety valve that you can pop off if the red zone starts getting a bit too hot. Both the Angel and Karador can be searched for with [Fierce Empath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath), meaning you don't really need more than one copy each.






[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Altar of Dementia)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar of Dementia)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kokusho, the Evening Star)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho, the Evening Star)








 If you manage to build up some Spirit tokens thanks to [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) and [Field of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+of+Souls), [Coat of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms) can make the tiny fliers into an airborne army, ready to kill your opponent in one massive attack. Finally, [Myr Retriever](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Retriever) can grab the [Coat of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms) out of the graveyard if it gets milled by [Altar of Dementia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Dementia) or intentionally put there by [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb). It can also get the Altar itself to help you get things started.

Abzimic
=======



 For my last Abzan deck for today, I decided to go with something a bit different. Rather than staying within Abzan colors, I built a deck around one particular Abzan-focused card: [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales).




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hardened Scales)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened Scales)


[Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) is one of the biggest hits to come out of *Khans of Tarkir*, particularly with the casual crowd. It gives you a permanent, powerful, and abusable effect for just one mana, making it perfect to build a deck around.



The enchantment is designed to work with outlast, and although it does that quite well, there's another mechanic I think it will be even better with: graft.



 First of all, a creature with graft will enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, so [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) will add one to that initial total, giving you some value immediately. Now if that creature survives, things start getting really crazy. You can graft a counter onto each new creature you cast, which will turn into two counters thanks to [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales).




 Let's run through a quick example. Nothing improbable, just a copy of the Scales and a few random graft dudes. You start off with [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) on turn one, followed by a [Simic Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Initiate) on turn two, which gets two counters. On the following turn, you cast [Vigean Graftmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigean+Graftmage), which enters the battlefield with three counters. Graft one counter over from the Initiate, and now the Guildmage has a total of five, while the Initiate still has the one it normally starts out with.






[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Simic Initiate)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic Initiate)




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vigean Graftmage)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigean Graftmage)








 On turn four, you throw down a [Plaxcaster Frogling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plaxcaster+Frogling) with four counters. You can get two more from [Simic Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Initiate), and another two by grafting a counter from [Vigean Graftmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigean+Graftmage). Now, where you would normally have a 2/2 and a 4/4 at best, you now have a 4/4 and an 8/8. Seems like a pretty solid upgrade, especially considering a one-mana enchantment made it happen.




 To fill out the graft curve, [Aquastrand Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquastrand+Spider) and [Cytoplast Root-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cytoplast+Root-Kin) will join the team. The Root-Kin is particularly effective, since it will add two counters to all of your creatures when it enters the battlefield. To share the love even more, [Kalonian Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Hydra) tops out the curve with the ability to make all your creatures instantly double in size when it attacks. There's also one more sweet graft card we're missing, and it's a weird one. [Llanowar Reborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Reborn) isn't a creature, but still enters the battlefield with a counter on it. That means you can graft that counter to the first creature you play. Although [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) won't make the land enter the battlefield with two counters, since it isn't a creature, it will double up the graft ability as usual.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Llanowar Reborn)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar Reborn)








 A single [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) adds some additional late-game backup for [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales), and [Enlightened Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) can be used to search for either. Without [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) this looks more like a solid graft deck that anything else, so having that redundancy is critical. Since the deck might have to clear a creature or two out of the way to win the game, I've added in a play set of [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) for its sheer effectiveness as a removal spell.

The Clans Are Assembling
========================


That's all I've got for Abzan today, but the clan's moment in the spotlight may not be over just yet. Next week, it will be a battle royale between the best of the best of the clan-based decks you've all submitted over the past few weeks. Abzan might still have one more chance to shine, but that all depends on which of you chose to represent the enduring desert warriors. I suppose you'll just have to check back then to find out the fate of Abzan or your own favorite clan.


See ya!
