The head table at the second draft of these Canadian nationals possessed, not 
 suprisingly an immense amount of talent in the magical cards by it's occupants. 
 With 7 3-0 players, and a 2-0-1 record there truly were some of the very best 
 draft talents in Canada in this drafting pod.


As a side note, the winner of this draft will most likely become this year's 
 Canadian limited event winner (if they still give trophies for that) and will 
 take that title away from yours truly.


Although the players were for the most part friendly to each other during the 
 draft, there were a few notable exceptions of players hate drafting another, 
 and more than one player left the table bearing hard feelings.


The table was seated as such:





1. Jeff Fung
2. Terry Tsang
3. Jurgen Hahn
4. Gary Wise
5. Nick Chen
6. Boyd Hardie
7. Gary Krakower
8. Alex Rennet


At least for Canada, the number of pro-tour points at this table was astounding 
with Fung, Tsang, Krakower and Wise all contributing their share. Rounding out 
the table was last year team member Nick Chen, '98 worlds competitor Boyd Hardie, 
and locals Jurgen Hahn and Alex Rennet.


 These are the picks for all the *Urza's Saga* packs: 


 Pack 1: 





1. Fung - Pegasus Charger
2. Tsang - Argothian Swine
3. Hahn - Phyrexian Ghoul
4. Wise - Disenchant
5. Chen - Blood Vassal
6. Hardie - Smoldering Crater
7. Krakower - Curfew
8. Rennet - Fiery Mantle


 This solid but unexciting pack got the draft off to a stable start. The first 
 three players all grab good creatures in separate colors. Gary then takes a 
 Disenchant over some mediocre cards and the rest of the picks are fairly poor, 
 although the underrated Fiery Mantle could have gone a little higher.





Pack 2:





1. Tsang - Jagged Lightning
2. Hahn - Corrupt
3. Wise - Pacifism
4. Chen - Heat Ray
5. Hardie - Energy Field
6. Krakower - Unworthy Dead
7. Rennet - Goblin Raider
8. Fung - Pendrell Flux


 Tsang decides to open this pack up with a bomb, and grabs a Jagged Lightning. 
 He seems to be going for the archetypal green / red deck. Hahn then takes an 
 excellent black card to go with his Ghoul, and Wise tries to cut off white by 
 taking the Pacifism. Chen then grabs the best cards left in the pack which was 
 the Heat Ray. Hardie rare drafts the Energy Field, and Krakower grabs his first 
 of many black cards. Rennet takes another beatdown red spell, and Fung slams 
 the Pendrell Flux declaring "I want to play blue white"!!





Pack 3:





1. Hahn - Child of Gaea
2. Wise - Sanctum Custodian
3. Chen - Symbiosis
4. Hardie - Shiv's Embrace
5. Krakower - Bog Raider
6. Rennet - Cave Tiger
7. Fung - Veiled Sentry
8. Tsang - Treefolk Seedlings


 Hahn opens up the amazing Child, and lacking any quality black cards in the 
 pack decides that he will be willing to fight Tsang for green. Wise rolls along 
 with another quality white pick, then Chen stuns the table by taking Symbiosis 
 over the Embrace when he already had a red card. Hardie picks his first playable 
 card in the Embrace, and passes it over to Krakower who takes another mediocre 
 black creature. Rennet grabs his first green spell and Fung and Tsang continue 
 their archetype drafting with their respective cards.  
  

 Pack 4:  


1. Wise - Energy Field
2. Chen - Smoldering Crater
3. Hardie - Retromancer
4. Krakower - Skirge Familiar
5. Rennet - Argothian Swine
6. Fung - Disenchant
7. Tsang - Crosswinds
8. Hahn - Phyrexian Ghoul

Wise opens this disappointing pack for his blue white deck and takes the rare 
 instead of making enemies through hate drafting. Chen then doesn't draft his 
 card on time and is forced to take a cycle land. Hardie continues into red with 
 a Retromancer, and Gary continues black by taking Skirge Familiar (although 
 many people prefer the Phyrexian Ghoul). Rennet takes another green creature 
 and it looks like the table has it's second green red mage. Fung and Tsang get 
 descent picks for their decks, and Hahn gets a great 8th pick Ghoul.





Pack 5:





1. Chen - Arc Lightning
2. Hardie - Acidic Soil
3. Krakower - Witch Engine
4. Rennet - Bull Hippo
5. Fung - Pacifism
6. Tsang - Goblin Raider
7. Hahn - Vielded Serpent
8. Wise - Pendrell Flux

After passing the Embrace two packs ago, Chen decides he likes red after all 
 and takes an Arc Lightning. Hardie gets an excellent finisher in Acidic Soil, 
 which is followed by another black creature for Krakower, which seem to get 
 a little better each time. Rennet takes his third green creature in a row, and 
 Fung grabs some important kill in the form of pacifism. Tsang takes another 
 weenie creature, then Jurgen literally take a Serpent out of the blue which 
 was nothing less than pure hate on the person sitting to his left. An upset 
 Wise has to settle for a Pendrell Flux.





Pack 6: 


1. Hardie - Sanctum Custodian
2. Krakower - Pestilence
3. Rennet - Phyrexian Collosus
4. Fung - Pendrell Drake
5. Tsang - Goblin Patrol
6. Hahn - Order of Yawgmoth
7. Wise - Cathodian
8. Chen - Hollow Dogs


 Boyd opens up perhaps the best common ever printed in Pestilence, but takes 
 his first white card in Custodian instead. Krakower obviously takes the Pestilence 
 in his so-far mono black deck. Rennet decides to go for some serious beef in 
 the Collosus, and Fung gets an excellent flier in Pendrell Drake. Tsang keeps 
 the weenies coming with a Patrol, then Hahn and Wise get very solid creatures 
 for their decks. Chen then keeps up his patented three color draft strategy 
 by taking the Hollow Dogs.





Pack 7:


1. Krakower - Expunge
2. Rennet - Voice of Law
3. Fung - Pegasus Charger
4. Tsang - Smoldering Crater
5. Hahn - Elvish Herder
6. Wise - Disciple of Law
7. Chen - Blasted Landscape
8. Hardie - Healing Salve

Gary takes some excellent black kill in Expung to start of this pack. Rennet, 
 seeing nothing he likes decides to kill of the Voice of Law which forces Fung 
 to settle for a Pegasus Charger. The rest of the picks were all mediocre cards 
 at best.





Pack 8:


1. Rennet - Morphling
2. Fung - Veiled Serpent
3. Tsang - Goblin Raider
4. Hahn - Corrupt
5. Wise - Lilting Refrain
6. Chen - R. Skirge
7. Hardie - Shower of Sparks
8. Krakower - Pendrell Flux


What to you do when you open up the best card in the set and it's not in your 
 color? If you're Alex Rennet you kill it. It's not clear whether it's Fung or 
 the Morphling he hates but either way Fung gets stuck with a Serpent and his 
 second disappointing pick in a row. Tsang gets another Goblin, and Hahn happily 
 takes his second Corrupt. Wise grabs a whatever card, and Chen picks up his 
 third black card, a Ravenous Skirge. Boyd and Krakower end the Saga picks with 
 mediocre cards.
 After the first pack, the color selections look like this:


 Fung U/W  

 Tsang R/G  

 Hahn B/G  

 Wise U/W  

 Chen B/R/G  

 Hardie R/W  

 Krakower B  

 Rennet R/G


This makes it four players drafting the U/W and G/R archetypes, and only two 
 situations where players sitting next to each other are drafting the same color. 
 Of course, with Chen that's hard to avoid. 



 The highlights from the decks after the final picks are as follows:



 Fung- Jeff has some great creatures with 2 Pegasus Charger, 4 Expendable Troops, 
 a Vigilant, and Pendrell Drake, with some creature removal like a Pacifism and 
 2 Disappears.



 Tsang- Terry will definitely be "axing" his opponents some questions with this 
 deck that contains: 2 Ghitu Slinger, Cinder Seer, Jagged Lightning, 2 Flame 
 Jet, 2 Lava Axes, Scent of Cinder, Reckless Abandon, Thorn Elemental, and a 
 bunch of Goblins.



 Hahn- Jurgan's deck features 2 Corrupts, Eradicate, and some great creatures 
 in Order of Yawgmoth, Child of Gaea, 2 Ticking Gnomes, and Hunting Moa, in addition, 
 he has Thran Golem, plus a Rancor and Twisted Experiment to load it up with.



 Wise- Gary's deck has some good fliers in a Thieving Magpie, Sustainer of the 
 Realm, and 2 Weatherseed Fairies, with good control like Field Surgeon, Sanctum 
 Custodian, Pacifism, and Planar Collapse to back them up.



 Chen- Nick ends up splashing red for Arc Lightning, Parch, Heat Ray, and Ghitu 
 Slinger. Green for a Symbiosis, and a few fatties. The rest of the deck is medium 
 quality black creatures and 2 Nightshade Seers.



 Hardie- Boyd's very solid deck has Mantis Engine, Sanctum Custodian, Ghitu Fire 
 Eater, and 2 Hulking Cyclops which he backs up with a Reckless Abandon, Scent 
 of Cinder, Parch, Acidic Soil and Shiv's Embrace.



 Krakower-Krakower's mono black deck has 2 Phyrexian Debasers, and Witch Engine, 
 but it's strongest points are it's kill spells which include, 2 Scent of Nightshade, 
 Eradicate, Attrition, Expunge, and Swat. He also has Phyrexian Reclamation.



 Rennet- Alex features the Yavimaya cards with a Hollows, 2 Elders, a Scion, 
 and a Wurm. Along side these are a Pattern of Rebirth and the Collosus.



 The early picks in this round? They have to go to Gary Krakower's incredibly 
 powerful mono black, and Terry Tsang's draft deck with ridiculous amounts of 
 burn.
