**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

**By Air**


 Located approximately 20 minutes from downtown Vancouver, [Vancouver International Airport](http://www.yvr.com/) (YVR) is ranked one of the top airports in the world and is served by a wide variety of local, national and international air carriers with direct routes to most major destinations. 


**By Bus**


There's plenty of bus service to, from, and around Vancouver along with scheduled service throughout BC, including Whistler, Seattle's SeaTac Airport, Bellingham Airport and Vancouver Island - which are all 2-3 hours out of Vancouver by car.


**By Train**



[TransLink](http://www.translink.bc.ca/) provides city transit for tourists and residents seven days a week via buses through its rapid transit system, SkyTrain. With the opening of the [Canada Line](http://www.translink.ca/), the Skytrain's newest line, travel between the Waterfront Station and Vancouver International Airport has been significantly reduced to 26 minutes per one-way trip. This allows for a more convenient trip for international travellers to and from downtown Vancouver. 

 In addition, [Via Rail's](http://www.viarail.ca/) western transcontinental train follows Highway 1 from Vancouver to Kamloops. [Amtrak's](/en/articles/archive/2008-07-24) Pacific Northwest route travels daily between Seattle and Vancouver.
