Lee Purslow hails from Portsmouth. He's been playing since 4th Edition, with a break in the middle, before returning for M10. Royde, meanwhile, is a Grand Prix Champion from earlier this year. Both players begin the round undefeated, with Purslow having a draw to spoil his perfect record.


Forests on either side opened the match, with [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker) the first action from Royde. [Armored Warhorse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse) arrived on turn three from Purslow, with Royde offering an apparent trade. 'Apparent', because [Titanic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) ensured the Piker would live, and the Warhorse would die. The following turn, [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker) actually did trade, this time for [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf).

*This is not the D.Royde you're looking for.* |



Royde had [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) which met with [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), before Royde had a [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf) of his own. [Griffin Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel) arrived for Purslow, and still the life totals were 20 apiece. [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) threatened acceleration for Royde, while Purslow ramped up his [Griffin Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel) with [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure). [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) took down the Sentinel, and following his attack Royde was able to cast [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) with Bloodthirst.


Purslow began anew with [Peregrine Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin), which looked like a substantial roadblock. Until, that is, [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) rendered it irrelevant. Royde piled in, dropping Purslow to ten, who replied with an even bigger roadblock in the form of [Vastwood Gorger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vastwood+Gorger). Royde, though, had a plan, and it was a plan that had been good for players for many years. It cost five mana, and had the name [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)...


Still, he waited to pull the trigger, casting [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) on the Gorger before dropping a second [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf). Now Purslow was down to just four, which put him well within range. [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) did the dirty deed, and Royde was one up.


Lee Purslow 0 - Daniel Royde 1


With Purslow playing green-white, Royde knew that he was in good shape to make his [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) count. Purslow needed to avoid a stall, and had to hope he could take to the air against the green-red of Royde.


Royde had [Goblin Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger) at the first attempt, while Purslow replicated Game 1 with an early [Armored Warhorse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse). Turn three saw Royde shoot Purslow with [Goblin Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger), enabling Bloodthirst for [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre). Purslow had [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) for the Bloodthirst 3/3, and attacked once more with his [Armored Warhorse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse). Royde repeated the Bloodthirst trick, laying another [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre), and the board was starting to clog up.

*This is the D.Royde you're looking for.* |



Purslow next offered [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer), and when Royde attacked he double blocked, forgetting the First Strike on the [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre). Royde added [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf), now strongly ahead. Purslow dropped [Jade Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Mage), thankful that [Goblin Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger) could only hit players rather than creatures.   

Royde dropped [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) onto the [Jade Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Mage), but Purslow had [Stave Off](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stave+Off) to send the [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) packing. [Jade Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Mage) created two tokens, and now blocking became potentially profitable. [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf) and token traded, token sucked up the damage from [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre), and Purslow was back in the game. Royde completed the turn with [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider).


[Titanic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) on [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) freed the Ogre from [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web), allowing Royde to pile in for 6, dropping Purslow to 8. With [Goblin Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger) continuing to ping away at end of turn, Purslow was under the gun, despite his token generator.


What did he have? [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)!!!


In came the team, with Royde at fourteen and looking to soak up some serious damage. Barely, just barely, he survived, at 1 life. But both his [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) and [Goblin Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger) were gone. [Griffin Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel) completed an excellent turn for Purslow, and Royde couldn't find a winning answer.


Lee Purslow 1 - Daniel Royde 1


Now the dynamic of the match had chnaged once more. Both players knew about the [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) the other had available. The edge was probably now with Purslow, who could use flyers in a way that Royde essentially couldn't. If it came to a stall, then it might well be all about the first [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun).


Royde had [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) in his opening hand. Not enough land, though, and he took six. He had [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) in his opening hand again. Again, he only had one land. Now he looked at five. He kept, but without an [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun).   
[Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) was his turn two, while [Pride Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pride+Guardian) was turn one from Purslow. Now that was a beating against a depleted Royde. [Armored Warhorse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse) arrived for Purslow, followed by [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), then [Alabaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage). Although Royde had plenty of land, he was sitting with just a [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) in play, which met [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web). [Alabaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) and the Warhorse piled in, with [Jade Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Mage) surely just rubbing salt into the wounds.


Royde swept up his permanents, and congratulated his opponent.
