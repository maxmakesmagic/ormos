![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_tempest_expansionLogo_en.jpg)Twelve years ago, Gerrard Capashen and the crew of the *Weatherlight* kicked off the Rath Cycle, picking up where *Weatherlight* left off. This set introduced **Magic** players to Slivers, [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll), [Living Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death), and [Tradewind Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tradewind+Rider).
