We're halfway through the month of May, and Organized Play is starting to get heated up as we sprint to the third month in 2016's second quarter. While we've still got four Grand Prix to look forward to this month—including two Modern main events this weekend—June promises even more, along with plenty of in-store play opportunities that you should take note of.


Going beyond that, but something that may pique your interest as we approach *Eternal Masters* previews, we have some initial information about Eternal Weekend in both North America and Europe to bring to you!


Modern Grand Prix Weekend
=========================


Ready to see the face of the new Modern after [the April 4 banned and restricted list updates](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/banned-and-restricted-announcement-2016-04-04)? Are you all set to see which *Shadows over Innistrad* cards make their debut in Modern?


ChannelFireball and StarCityGames.com play host to a Modern Weekend, with [Grand Prix Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpla16) and [Grand Prix Charlotte](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpcha16) both taking place May 20–22. The main event format is—you guessed it—Modern, and thousands of players are expected to be competing across both Grand Prix to show the world their Modern Constructed deck building and piloting skills.


Can't make it to either? You can still follow all the action and see plenty of decklists that come out of both events from the comfort of your home or on the go. [Charlotte's coverage](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcha16) will include text writers Jacob Van Lunen and Meghan Wolff, both bringing you the latest from the event hall. [Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpla16) will feature articles from Marc Calderaro as well as Hallie Santo, who is making her official *Magic* coverage debut!


You'll also be able to follow along with the GP LA main event action live on [twitch.tv/channelfireball](http://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball). Coverage begins both days at 9:15 a.m. PT/12:15 p.m. ET/5:15 p.m. UTC, with commentary from Marshall Sutcliffe, Gaby Spartz, Luis Scott-Vargas, and William Jensen!


RPTQs and GP Minneapolis/Manchester Next Weekend!
=================================================


Coming up next week are some important events to take notice of:


* [Grand Prix Minneapolis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmin16) and [Grand Prix Manchester](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpman16) will highlight two multi-day Standard main events, as we see how the metagame continues to evolve since the release of *Shadows over Innistrad*. Jacob Van Lunen and Melissa DeTora will be providing you text coverage from Minneapolis, while Tobi Henke and Frank Karsten will be bringing you the latest decklists and articles from Manchester.
* Also happening next weekend are the first sets of [Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs) that feed Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/rptqsyd16) in Sydney, Australia (taking place August 5–7). The format of this upcoming round of RPTQs is *Shadows over Innistrad* Sealed, and we'll have the chance to see who will be earning coveted invitations and airfare to the upcoming Pro Tour. We'll be bringing you decklists from as many of these events as we can get—with the same being true for the remaining RPTQs the weekend after—so keep your eyes on Thursday's Organized Play articles following the events to see what people build out of their Sealed pools!

World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers Kicking Off in June!
=================================================


The first set of World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers (WMCQs) isn't that far away. In fact, the first round of WMCQs is coming up June 18–19. The format for this first round of WMCQs is Standard, with 73 countries hosting events that weekend to see who will lock up the first spot on their country's team in this year's World *Magic* Cup.


All players who participate in a World *Magic* Cup get an event-exclusive [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) promo card (while supplies last).

The winners will receive invitations to compete on their country's team in the 2016 World *Magic* Cup, along with airfare to get to the event. The 2016 World *Magic* Cup takes place in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, November 18–20.


Players from the Philippines, listen up: in order to accommodate the best possible play experience, the World *Magic* Cup Qualifier events in your country have been confirmed to be *two-day* events. Please make note of this and plan accordingly!

Eternal Weekend in 2016
=======================


With *Eternal Masters* previews coming up, now seems like a great time to highlight this year's Eternal Weekend events! You read that right: for 2016, Eternal Weekend events for Legacy and Vintage will take place in North America *and* Europe!


First up is North America's Eternal Weekend, presented by Card Titan. Eternal Weekend for 2016 will take place at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio, from October 27 through 30.


You may have noticed that Eternal Weekend now encompasses more days. As a result of continued growth, the event has been expanded! The Vintage Championship Swiss rounds will take place on Friday, October 28, and the Legacy Championship Swiss rounds will take place on Saturday, October 29. The Top 8 for both events will take place on Sunday, October 30, allowing for more manageable days and a lot of exciting opportunities!


Current info on North America's Eternal Weekend can be found on the [Card Titan event info page](http://www.cardtitan.com/eternal_weekend), and that'll be what you want to bookmark as we get closer to the event, as you'll get more info from that site as we near October.


In addition to Eternal Weekend in Columbus, Ohio, European players will also be able to participate in their region! Bazaar of Moxen will be hosting an Eternal Weekend this year in Paris, France, October 22–23, bringing the Legacy Championship and Vintage Championship to Europe's Eternal fans.


The event will take place at the Espace Charenton.
