DAY 1 COVERAGE



Good morning from Canada! We’re north of the border as the *Hour of Devastation* dawns in Toronto. There will certainly be some appearances by Nicol Bolas, the God-Pharaoh as we move through nine rounds of *Hour of Devastation-Amonkhet* Sealed Deck, and who knows what might unfold as we march toward the Top 8.


While a number of the game’s top professionals are competing in Kyoto ahead of next week’s Pro Tour, there are still plenty of notable names here. Leading the way are Ben Weitz, Jarvis Yu and Andrew Cuneo, three of the game’s best. Also in attendance is old-school competitor Rich Hoaen, once the best Limited player in the world.


What will happen in Toronto? It’s a brand new world as the hour comes to pass in Amonkhet, and by the end of the weekend we’ll see who sits at the top.
