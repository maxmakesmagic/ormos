It's the first day of the year and we're already deep into *Gatecrash* previews. Let's keep the momentum going with a look at the booster packs!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1137_1_1imutg088j.jpg)There are five *Gatecrash* booster packs, so it seems like a safe guess that the five guilds of *Gatecrash* will be represented. This one is Dimir!
