By Mark Rosewater




 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






*Welcome to Everyone Deserves Some Time Off For the Holidays So We Rerun the Best of 2004 Week! (Followed next week by Hey Wait, the Holidays Aren't Over Yet Week.) Due to the fact that we won't be back in the office until the Monday after New Years Day, Scott Wills and I get the honor of having three "best of" columns, with new content resuming on Tuesday, January 4th.* 

*So let's start with my #3 choice. After looking over all my columns for the year, I had a small list of my favorites. Once I crossed off "Elegance" as I just didn't feel like poking the bear yet again, I had three columns left. This first column was a nod back to a play I wrote in college called "Leggo My Ego". (Note that this was years before the TV show "Herman's Head" went on the air.) The premise of the play was that the main character was questioning whether or not to cheat on his girlfriend of two and a half years when a girl he's obsessed over for years offers to have a one-night stand with him. The entire play is held in his head as his emotions argue out what he should do. I'm often asked how the creative process works. While I can't speak for everyone, this column was my attempt to show how my creative process works - in the style of "Leggo My Ego". One of the things that struck me about rereading the column was how much truth is tucked away in the comedy of the piece. You want to know how I create, here's literally a peek inside my head.*


*This article originally appeared on June 14th, 2004.* 
*The curtain rises to show six individuals sitting around a dimly lit table. At the head of the table is STRUCTURE wearing a three-piece suit. He has a laptop open and appears to be in charge. Next to him is INSPIRATION dressed in what appears to be a stereo-typical mad scientist outfit. His hair is all mussed up and he wears glasses. Next to INSPIRATION is CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY is dressed like a painter. He is covered by paint in every imaginable color. Next to CURIOSITY is PASSION. PASSION is dressed like a character off the cover of a Harlequin Romance novel. Beside PASSION is IMITATION. IMITATION wears pieces of clothing that match the other five at the table. Finally, next to IMITATION is REBELLION. REBELLION is dressed like a teenage rebel out of a 50's movie. He clearly is upset to be sitting next to IMITATION.*

STRUCTURE  
 We need to settle down. Mark needs artifacts for *Fifth Dawn*. 

CURIOSITY  
 Why artifacts?

STRUCTURE  
 Because the major theme of the *Mirrodin* block is artifacts. So Mark wants to spend some time making sure there are some interesting artifacts in *Fifth Dawn*.

CURIOSITY  
 Why start with the interesting cards?

STRUCTURE  
 Because it…

REBELLION  
 For the love of god! Why do you let him do this every time? Stop answering his questions! Cause we all know *he* isn't going to stop.

CURIOSITY  
 Why is that?

STRUCTURE  
 Let's move on. Does anyone have any interesting ideas for an artifact? Uh, Inspiration?

INSPIRATION  
 Uh, not yet.

STRUCTURE  
 All right. Imitation, why don't you get us started?

IMITATION  
 Okay. And the name is Homage. 

REBELLION  
 Give me a break.

STRUCTURE  
 Rebellion, settle down. Uh, Homage, why don't we start by thinking about mana production.

IMITATION  
 There's the mana batteries, the diamonds, the pieces of Ramos…

REBELLION  
 Here's an idea. Why don't we come up with an idea that isn't just a rehash of something we've done before? 

STRUCTURE  
 When Inspiration has an idea, I'd love to hear it. Until then, we need to prod this little meeting along anyway we can.

REBELLION  
 Fine. How about we look at non-artifacts that deal with mana?

IMITATION  
 All right. What color?

STRUCTURE  
 Passion, name a color.

PASSION  
 Wow, each of the colors is so cool in it's own right. What criteria am I supposed to use?

REBELLION  
 Blue! Just use blue.

IMITATION  
 Okay, blue mana producers. Let's see. There's [Drain Power](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Power), [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide), [Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg), [Mana Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain)…

INSPIRATION  
[Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg)?

IMITATION  
 Yeah, it's an *Ice Age* enchantment that allows you to save up mana for future turns.

INSPIRATION  
 There's something about [Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg). I like [Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg).

PASSION  
[Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg)'s a cool card. We should do something with [Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg).

STRUCTURE  
 This is good. Let's talk about [Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg).

INSPIRATION  
[Celestial Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Prism)!

CURIOSITY  
 What just happened there?

IMITATION  
[Celestial Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Prism) is an artifact from Alpha that allows you to convert mana into another color. 

PASSION  
 That was a cool card.

REBELLION  
 No, it wasn't. That card sucked. I think what Curiosity was asking was what does [Celestial Prism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Prism) have to do with [Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg)?

STRUCTURE  
 Obviously, it… uh, Inspiration?

INSPIRATION  
 You see, *Fifth Dawn* is trying to help support combo decks. But it also has a five-color theme. The former needs mana batteries while the latter wants color fixing. What if you combine the two into one card?

PASSION  
 That's brilliant! I love it.

CURIOSITY  
 What do we call it?

INSPIRATION  
 I was thinking Ice Machine. You know, as a nod towards [Iceberg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iceberg).

STRUCTURE  
 Passion?

PASSION  
[Gemstone Array](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Array).

STRUCTURE  
 One down. Next?

REBELLION  
 How about artifacts that counter spells?

STRUCTURE   
[Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s are blue's domain. We don't want to muddy up the color wheel.

REBELLION  
 Oh no, not the precious color wheel. Heaven forbid we mess with the color wheel. We might actually make something new and different. 

STRUCTURE  
 Don't screw with me. 

REBELLION  
 What are you going to do? Make more rules. I love rules. Without rules there's nothing to break. 

STRUCTURE  
 We're not having this fight… again. I'm in charge here. You don't want to follow my rules, there's the door.

REBELLION  
 Ooh, the fascist approach. Well, I'm going to stay. Because you can't watch all the rules all the time.

INSPIRATION  
 Something about a different kind of mana.

CURIOSITY  
 What kind?

INSPIRATION   
 I don't know. Some artifact that produces a different kind of mana. 

CURIOSITY  
 Like another color? A sixth color?

STRUCTURE  
 What is this? Retread old arguments day? Why are you talking about the sixth color?

CURIOISITY  
 Why are *you* talking about the sixth color?

PASSION  
 A sixth color would be so cool. 

REBELLION  
 Why stop at six. Why not five new colors?

STRUCTURE  
 Stop! No new colors.

INSPIRATION  
 Not a new mana. A new way to manipulate mana.

IMITATION  
 Like [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)? It can only be used to play artifacts?

INSPIRATION  
 Not a limitation. A manipulation.

CURIOSITY  
 Does anyone know what he's talking about?

REBELLION  
 Never do.

STRUCTURE  
 How about we help Inspiration instead of mocking him?

PASSION  
 Sounds good. 

CURIOSITY  
 How do we do that?

STRUCTURE  
 Let's ask him questions.

CURIOSITY  
 You need someone to ask questions? Inspiration, what kind of manipulation are you talking about?

INSPIRATION  
 I want to do something that's never been done before. It's on the tip of my brain.

CURIOSITY  
 Is it like any other game feature?

INSPIRATION  
 That's it. Give me another game feature. 

IMITATION  
 Attacking.

INSPIRATION  
 No, one that's numerical in nature.

IMITATION  
 Life.

INSPIRATION  
 All right. What can be done with life?

IMITATION  
 You can gain life. You can lose life. You can spend life. You can be reset to a certain life total. 

REBELLION  
 How about doubling life?

IMITATION  
 There's no card that doubles your life.

REBELLION  
 Yet. 

STRUCTURE  
 We do not use the word “double”.

IMITATION  
[Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk)

STRUCTURE   
 That's Alpha.

IMITATION  
[Blind Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Fury), [Desperate Gambit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Gambit), [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath)

STRUCTURE  
 It's not very often.

IMITATION  
[Game of Chaos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Game+of+Chaos), [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher), [Gratuitous Violence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gratuitous+Violence)

STRUCTURE  
 Fine, occasionally.

IMITATION  
[Impulsive Maneuvers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impulsive+Maneuvers), all the cards that have double strike, the cycle of Double cards from *Unglued*.

STRUCTURE  
 Fine, we'll do double your life. But it should be a white card. I'll put it down for later. We're supposed to be coming up with artifacts.

REBELLION  
 Why does it have to be a white card? Artifacts can't gain life?

IMITATION  
[Angel's Feather](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Feather), [Balm of Restoration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balm+of+Restoration), [Bottle Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes)…

STRUCTURE  
 Artifacts have some life gain, yes. But a major shift in life gain belongs in the color that specializes in the ability. We'll use the card, just in white.

INSPIRATION  
 Double mana!

CURIOSITY  
 What?

INSPIRATION  
 We make an artifact that allows players to double the mana in their pool. 

PASSION  
 Awesome! 

STRUCTURE  
 What do you call it?

INSPIRATION  
[Doubling Cube](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Cube).

STRUCTURE  
 Passion?

PASSION  
 I actually like [Doubling Cube](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Cube).

CURIOSITY  
 How often does that happen?

IMITATION  
 All the *Mirrodin* mechanics actually use their design name. 

REBELLION  
 Blah, blah, blah. 

STRUCTURE  
 Can we move on? 

REBELLION  
 Fine, can we move away from mana? Snooze-ville. Let's do something a little more dangerous.

CURIOSITY  
 Like what?

REBELLION  
 Let's break a rule.

STRUCTURE  
 What?

REBELLION  
**Magic** is the game that breaks its own rules. Let's break a rule. 

STRUCTURE  
 That's not how we do things. We don't make cards simply to break rules. We break rules when there is no other way to do a card we want to make.

REBELLION  
 Stop reading Mark's column. 

STRUCTURE  
 Read it? I wrote it.

REBELLION  
 How about breaking the rule that players can't play cards before the game begins?

IMITATION  
[Serum Powder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Powder) already does that.

REBELLION  
 How about a card that lets you put your opponent's cards in your hand?

IMITATION  
*Unglued*'s [Mirror Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Mirror) allowed that. Although their hand was your hand when you did it.

REBELLION  
 One land a turn?

IMITATION  
[Fastbond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fastbond). Duh.

STRUCTURE  
 Why don't we think about a rule that players could build a deck around?

INSPIRATION  
 What if we take something away?

CURIOSITY  
 Like what?

IMITATION  
[Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis) took away the untap phase.

STRUCTURE  
 Untap step.

REBELLION  
 Step. Phase. Who cares? If Imitation…

IMITATION  
 Homage.

REBELLION  
 I'm not calling you Homage! Your name is Imitation. Im-i-ta-tion! 

IMITATION  
 I'll accept Sincerest Form of Flattery.

REBELLION  
 I can't even defend you when I agree with you. 

INSPIRATION  
 Upkeep.

CURIOSITY  
 What? Why do I keeping saying “what” every time Inspiration says something intelligible?

INSPIRATION  
 How about an artifact that skips the upkeep?

REBELLION  
 All right! My man, Inspiration.

STRUCTURE  
 I don't think skipping upkeep is a good idea. Upkeep costs are an important balance to card design.

REBELLION  
 I say we vote.

STRUCTURE   
 Fine. Passion's vote doesn't count.

PASSION  
 Hey.

STRUCTURE  
 Sorry, Passion. You're just not the most objective one here.

REBELLION  
 Fine.

STRUCTURE  
 I vote no. Rebellion obviously votes yes.

INSPIRATION  
 I'll vote yes.

STRUCTURE  
 Imitation?

IMITATION  
 I don't know. It seems kind of different.

REBELLION  
 Exactly! 

IMITATION  
 I think I'll vote no.

REBELLION  
 Come on Curiosity. 

PASSION  
 I do like it.

REBELLION  
 Shocker. Curiosity, would you like to see this card printed?

CURIOSITY  
 Would I?

REBELLION  
 You knew this was going to happen. I have to get an answer out of Curiosity to get the card made.

STRUCTURE  
 Oh, you do, don't you.

REBELLION  
 Curiosity, I know you like talking in questions. But would one answer kill you?

CURIOSITY  
 Would it kill you to follow the rules once in a while?

REBELLION  
 I'm doomed.

CURIOSITY  
 Why is that? Is it impossible to provide an answer and still be a question? I mean, why wouldn't I want this card to be made?

REBELLION  
 Yes! Put it on the list.

STRUCTURE  
 Fine. 

PASSION  
 Yeah!

STRUCTURE   
 What do I call it?

INSPIRATION  
 No Paying The Piper

STRUCTURE  
 That doesn't even sound like an artifact. Passion?

PASSION  
 Call it [Eon Hub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eon+Hub).

REBELLION  
 We're on a roll here. Let's break some more rules.

CURIOSITY  
 What rules do you want to break?

REBELLION  
 I don't care. Name some rules.

IMITATION   
 Game rules or design rules?

REBELLION  
 Ooh, design rules. Give me a design rule.

IMITATION  
 Don't make lands that produce more than one mana.

REBELLION  
 What else?

IMITATION  
 Be careful with cards that draw more than one card.

REBELLION  
 That's a rule?

STRUCTURE  
 Yes.

REBELLION  
 Really?

STRUCTURE  
 Yes.

REBELLION  
 Really?!

STRUCTURE  
 Yes! This isn't helping. Imitation, give me a card. Let's see if we can prod Inspiration.

IMITATION  
 What kind of card do you want?

STRUCTURE  
 An older card. From, uh, *Mirage* block.

IMITATION  
*Mirage*, *Visions* or *Weatherlight*?

STRUCTURE  
*Visions*.

IMITATION  
 Give me a card type.

STRUCTURE  
 Enchantment

IMITATION  
 There are twenty enchantments in *Visions*. [Blanket of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blanket+of+Night), [Breathstealer's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breathstealer%27s+Crypt), [City of Solitude](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Solitude)…

INSPIRATION  
[City of Solitude](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Solitude).

CURIOSITY  
 What about [City of Solitude](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Solitude)?

STRUCTURE  
 We could make an artifact version.

INSPIRATION  
 We could do it differently.

CURIOSITY  
 How?

INSPIRATION  
 What if players could only play all cards at sorcery speed?

PASSION  
 Interesting.

INSPIRATION  
 It would function like [City of Solitude](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Solitude) but in a different way.

CURIOSITY  
 Couldn't you extend the idea?

INSPIRATION  
 What do you mean?

CURIOSITY  
 You're asking me?

STRUCTURE  
 Perhaps Curiosity is talking about parallel structure. The current version hurts both players. Is there a way for it to just hurt the opponent?

INSPIRATION  
 It could only affect other players.

PASSION  
 It's missing something. How about helping you?

INSPIRATION  
 How could it help you?

IMITATION  
 It could let you draw cards like [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine).

STRUCTURE  
 What does you drawing cards have to do with your opponent playing things at sorcery speed?

REBELLION  
 Does everything have to connect? 

STRUCTURE  
 Uh, yeah. If you want good design aesthetics.

INSPIRATION  
 Instant speed!

CURIOSITY  
 What?

INSPIRATION  
 The artifact makes your opponent play everything at sorcery speed and you get to play everything at instant speed.

PASSION  
 That's cool!

STRUCTURE  
 I like it. What should we call it?

REBELLION  
 Wait, wait, wait. You're going to make a card that lets players play any card at instant speed. 

STRUCTURE  
 Well, technically… uh, yes. 

REBELLION  
 Then why are we messing around with the stupid sorcery part? 

CURIOSITY  
 What do you mean?

REBELLION  
 We've never ever in the history of the game let players play cards at instant speed.

IMITATION  
 Actually, we've had artifacts, creatures and enchantments that have all been playable at instant speed.

REBELLION  
 Fine, we've never had a card that let sorceries be cast at instant speed. That's cool. Stop there. Mission accomplished.

INSPIRATION  
 But the card has a nice duality.

REBELLION  
 Inspiration, your job is to come up with the ideas. Let us evaluate them. 

PASSION  
 Rebellion's right. An artifact that lets you play anything at instant speed is plenty cool by itself.

STRUCTURE  
 Fine. What do we call it?

INSPIRATION  
 I was thinking the Orb of Inversing. Of course, that's for my first version.

STRUCTURE  
 Passion?

PASSION  
 How about [Vedalken Orrery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Orrery).

CURIOSITY  
 What's an Orrery?

IMITATION  
 It's an apparatus which illustrates, by the revolution of balls moved by wheelwork, the relative size, periodic motions, positions, orbits, etc., of bodies in the solar system. It's named in honor of the Earl of Orrery. 

CURIOSITY  
 Is that courtesy of dictionary.com?

IMITATION  
 Why yes it is.

STRUCTURE  
 (looking at his watch)  
 All right, we have time for one last card. 

CURIOSITY  
 Why only one more card?

REBELLION  
 Oh yes. That's when we have to work on our other project.

STRUCTURE  
 Anyone have any way they want to prod Inspiration?

PASSION  
 I do. I have a really cool card name. Could we make a card for it?

STRUCTURE  
 Okay. What's the name?

PASSION  
 Perpetual Motion Machine.

CURIOSITY  
 What is it?

IMITATION  
 It's a…

PASSION  
 It's okay Imitation. I got this one. A Perpetual Motion Machine is a machine that runs forever. Usually this means that it produces the energy it needs to run itself.

STRUCTURE  
 But it doesn't actually exist.

PASSION  
 It hasn't been discovered yet. There's a difference.

STRUCTURE  
 No, logically by the laws of energy, it can't exist.

PASSION  
 By the laws of energy as we understand them now.

STRUCTURE  
 All the current attempts at Perpetual Motion Machines have been machines that just wind down very, very slowly.

INSPIRATION  
 Perpetual Motion Machine. I like it. This sounds like some kind of engine card.

CURIOSITY  
 What does it do?

INSPIRATION  
 Something that perpetuates itself. 

REBELLION  
 How about untapping things?

IMITATION  
 Historically we've gotten ourselves into trouble by allowing repeatable untapping.

REBELLION  
 Why do you think I suggested it?

INSPIRATION  
 A true Perpetual Motion Machine would allow you to tap an artifact to untap another artifact. But even I know that's broken in half. And I'm not even supposed to think about things like that.

STRUCTURE  
 What if there's a net loss over time?

INSPIRATION  
 Like tapping *two* artifacts to untap one?

STRUCTURE  
 Exactly

REBELLION  
 Sounds dangerous. I like it.

PASSION  
 I like it too. But it's not a Perpetual Motion Machine.

IMITATION  
 It's like an item that claims to be a Perpetual Motion Machine.

STRUCTURE  
 I'll put it down as Perpetual Motion Machine.

PASSION  
 No. Call it, uh, [Clock of Omens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clock+of+Omens).

STRUCTURE  
 Done.

*An ALARM sounds from STRUCTURE's watch. REBELLION smiles.* 


STRUCTURE  
 I guess that's all the *Fifth Dawn* for today. Tomorrow we'll work on some of the colored cards. 

INSPIRATION  
 That double life card gave me a cool idea for a cycle.

*STRUCTURE passes the laptop to REBELLION and pulls out a gag. REBELLION then ties it around STRUCTURE's mouth.*

REBELLION  
 It's time.

PASSION  
 Yeah! I love *Unhinged*!

THE END

I hope you enjoyed today's little play and that it gives you all some insight into my creative process. 

Join me next week when I talk about some pretty little angel eyes.

Until then, may your creative elements prod your Inspiration.

Mark Rosewater
