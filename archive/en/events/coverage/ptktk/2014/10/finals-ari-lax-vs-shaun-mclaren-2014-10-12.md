 After winning Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* with a White-Blue-Red Control deck earlier this year, Shaun McLaren came to Honolulu armed with a similar deck, however it now had a name: Jeskai Wins.



But could it actually win? McLaren would have to beat Ari Lax's Abzan Midrange deck first. Lax has been considered one of the better players without a Pro Tour Top 8 for some time now, with seven Grand Prix Top 8s to his name already, and he was now only one match win away from the coveted Pro Tour title himself.


"I have to be on the draw? That seems like some shenanigans!" Lax joked as they shuffled.


"Well, you don't have to be on the draw," replied McLaren.


"Ooh! Would you like to draw?" Lax offered.


"Okay, you have to draw." McLaren decided.




*Only one more match remained before an owner of the Pro Tour* Khans of Tarkir *trophy was determined.*
