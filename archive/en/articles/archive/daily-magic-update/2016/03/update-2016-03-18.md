The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 18, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Badass Lady Town](#badass).


Today's Previews
================


Every day during preview season, you can look to this section for any previews you might have missed, as we'll keep it updated with anything previewed not on DailyMTG.


1. [Limited Delirium from Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-328-oath-of-the-gatewatch-sunset-show-and-shadows-over-innistrad-preview-cards/)

Luis Scott-Vargas and Marshall Sutcliffe say goodbye to *Oath of the Gatewatch* and hello to four Limited stalwarts with delirium. Did I say Luis Scott-Vargas? Didn't he preview, like, two other cards already? What clown keeps giving this guy previews?


1. [Second Harvest](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/second-harvest-shadows-innistrad-spoiler)

What card caused The Command Zone to exclaim, "Holy crap! It's an INSTANT!"? Well, this one, obviously. Click to find out what it does and what Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai think of it.


1. [Behold the Beyond](http://tocage.jp/pages/1457949912.html)

I don't read a lick of Japanese, so I'm not entirely sure what the Tocage.jp page I'm sending you to says, but I do know that they were nice enough to have the card previewed in both English and Japanese, so chances are good you can read it if you're reading this.


1. [Villiage Messenger/Moonrise Intruder](http://joyofcubing.blogspot.com/)

The Joy of Cubing podcast previews another possible addition to cubes looking for aggressive red creatures. Should it make the cut in your cube? Listen and find out!


1. [Confirm Suspicions](http://www.hobbyconsolas.com/noticias/magic-gathering-nueva-carta-exclusiva-mundial-139630)

Also not in English, as our worldwide preview train continues with Hobbyconsolas in Spain, but your suspicions about the card's abilities just from looking at it will be confirmed by [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4axhet/soi_confirmar_sospechas_es/) that provides a handy translation.


1. [Asylum Visitor](https://imgur.com/a/jkSKG)

This one ended up being a store preview over in our Asia Pacific region, and it looks like they enjoyed it. Now, if you're triggering this against an opponent, however, they are likely not enjoying it.


1. [Always Watching](https://twitter.com/haste_mtg/status/710655029586169857)

Korean preview cards often don't get found by the wider internet, but this time it was picked up. Good job, everyone. As [one commenter pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4awhx6/soi_korean_card_anthem_effect/), the virtue is super tangible here.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Forbes* on *Magic*’s Diversity](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2016/03/18/for-magic-the-gathering-diversity-is-the-marketing-strategy/#78f880755393)

For today’s entry into other people talking about us, *Forbes* highlights the diversity that courses through pretty much everything we do.


1. [The Mana Source preview review videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGsoeNcK9QA89LtitGX1bRGJsZ7lFI7u0) | Wedge

Wedge is cranking out a video reviewing cards already previewed every day. In fact, he's probably made another video while I was typing this sentence. Go check it out if you just can't get enough previews.


1. [Three Decks for *Shadows over Innistrad* Standard](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13172&writer=Craig+Wescoe&articledate=3-18-2016) | TCGPlayer | Craig Wescoe

Pro Tour Champion Craig Wescoe has some ideas for *Shadows over Innistrad* Standard—three of them, to be exact. And only one of them contains white cards!


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [You Play to Win the Game](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32592_You-Play-To-Win-The-Game.html)

In the middle of preview talk yesterday, it was a non-preview article that generated a lot of the discussion around professional play. Ross Merriam at StarCityGames [wrote an article](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32592_You-Play-To-Win-The-Game.html) about the problems and difficulties with collusion which was, in part, a response to [an article written by Eric Froehlich](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/11th-in-houston-with-jeskai-black/). The article generated a ton of commentary on the article itself, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4atn4k/you_play_to_win_the_game_ross_merriam_on/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RossMBoss/status/710482876140113920).

Enough said.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames Indianapolis Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/190316_indianapolis_fact_sheet.html)

Standard is the main name of the game across the plains as the format wanes. Coverage starts at 10:30 a.m. ET (7:30 a.m PT) Saturday on [twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive). Come watch [Siege Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)'s last ride and [Mantis Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)'s final siege before *Shadows over Innistrad* engulfs everything.


1. [*Magic* Madhouse Pro Series](http://www.magicmadhouse.co.uk/magic-madhouse-pro-series-i68)

If that isn't enough Standard viewing for your pleasure, or if you'd like to watch something before the SCG stream starts, or if you just love the dulcet tones of Pro Tour commentator Tim Willoughby, tune in to the *Magic* Madhouse Pro Series event starting Saturday at 11 a.m. in London, 7 a.m. ET, and 4 a.m. PT on [twitch.tv/magicmadhouse](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmadhouse).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Elves Invade Pauper](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/pauper-constructed-league-2016-03-17)

I've got a soft spot for today's deck, as Elves was the first-ever Pauper deck I played—and I played quite a lot of it. This was back before I worked at Wizards and had access to the secret vault of [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)es and started using [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s as coasters. They were lean times, but they were good times. And we were happy.


During those times, I would warm myself by the flames fueled by token and ad cards, and I'd play something resembling this beauty. It looks, at first glance, like a pile of tribal synergies, but look closer at what the deck has going for it.


For one, it only plays thirteen lands. Yeah, thirteen. Flooding out in this deck means having four lands in play.


Four lands also just happens to be enough to play the other defining card in this deck, [Distant Melody](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distant+Melody). With Melody—which can be cast using [Birchlore Rangers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birchlore+Rangers) or off the Island searched up by [Sylvan Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Ranger)—you draw a card for every creature you have in play, and then cast a bunch more, which, coincidentally, fuels the next Melody. It's not [Glimpse of Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature) and it's not quite a combo deck, but when it gets going, this deck can have a really combo-esque feel to it, especially with the tricks this deck can do with [Quirion Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Ranger). [Priest of Titania](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Titania) is equally absurd in this deck.


It's not currently considered a top dog in Pauper, but it definitely belongs in the discussion.
