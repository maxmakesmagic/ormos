Welcome to Johnny Week!

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130610093948im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/sf/sf50_patronSaint.jpg)Let me introduce you to the abstract entity of the hour, if you're not familiar. Johnny is one of [the three "psychographics"](/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr220b) Mark Rosewater introduced to answer that all-important question: why do we play?

Now, the answer to that question might seem trivially obvious (*to have fun*, of course!), but there many possible answers falling into three broad answers personified by the three psychographics. Spike plays to prove something—in other words, to win. Timmy plays to experience something—putting us right back at "having fun"—and that makes him the patron saint of Serious Fun, as I argued in [The Timmy Manifesto](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/29). Johnny plays to express something—to pull off that crazy combo, to follow a theme as far as it can be followed, to do something nobody ever did before. That can make him a ton of fun to play with, but it can also lead to absurd antics when you'd really rather just play **Magic**.

In [his article](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/50) this week, Mark talked about how the folks who make **Magic** keep Johnny happy. That is, of course, his beat; we're a little more concerned with the practical. Let's explore what Johnny looks like at the casual / multiplayer table.

Vive la Différence
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130609162110im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/sf/sf50_megTwo.jpg)When I taught my friend Laura how to play **Magic**, I introduced her to the Timmy / Johnny / Spike terminology, in large part because it's everyday vocabulary in my (perhaps atypical?) group of friends. She immediately understood the difference between Spike on the one hand and Timmy and Johnny on the other—Spike is determined to win at all costs, whereas the other two have other, more intrinsic goals—but it took her a while to understand the difference between Timmy and Johnny. That's understandable; they both, after all, set their own goals and pursue them, not independently of the desire to win, but uncoupled from it.

So what is the difference? Basically, Timmy wants what he wants based on how cool it is in a vacuum, with little or no thought about whether anybody's ever done it before. He takes no special pleasure in being clever; if having [Meglonoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meglonoth) on the battlefield is fun, then it really doesn't matter to him that he's doing pretty much the same thing with it that anybody else does. The more it does, the better the story will be, but Timmy's not going to go out of his way to blow your mind.

For Johnny, on the other hand, a big part of the enjoyment is wrapped up in making plays that are startling and unique—not just casting [Meglonoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meglonoth) and attacking and blocking with it, but forcing everyone to attack using [Fumiko the Lowblood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumiko+the+Lowblood), slamming down [Meglonoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meglonoth) with [Dramatic Entrance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dramatic+Entrance) or [Elvish Piper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Piper), and hitting it with [Valor Made Real](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valor+Made+Real) to burn out multiple players at once. Bet you haven't seen *that* before!

(You might recall that I suggested doing all of those things in my [preview](/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/22) of [Meglonoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meglonoth). I have a pretty substantial Johnny streak, and preview articles in particular bring it out.)
