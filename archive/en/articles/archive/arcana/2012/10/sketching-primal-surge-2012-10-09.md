As you might have noticed there is an unintentional mini-theme to today. Both Gavin Verhey and Adam Styborski were seized by their writing muses and forced to write about [Primal Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Surge). For that reason we're going to further the mini-theme and look at [Primal Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Surge)'s art description, sketch and final art! 



**Color:** Green spell  
**Location:** "Gothic" forest  
**Action:** This spell causes new life to spring out of the ground -- on a MASSIVE scale. Show a mage figure in the foreground, throwing his hands up to summon up the spell. Near the mage, a "geyser" of green magical energy sprouts up, splaying outward as it rises like the branches of a giant tree. The "branches" of this magical eruption turn into animal shapes: perhaps greenish magic in the shape of snakes, boars, birds, dragons, and wolves.  
**Focus:** The giant magical "life eruption"  
**Mood:** Massive, powerful life magic
