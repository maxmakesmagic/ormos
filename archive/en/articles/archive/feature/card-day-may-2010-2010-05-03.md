Card of the Day - May, 2010

![Gustcloak Cavalier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gustcloak+Cavalier)**[Gustcloak Cavalier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Cavalier)** – *Time Spiral* uncommon. Many [Time Spiral](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Spiral) cards referenced two or more cards from previous sets. Indeed, it was basically the set's theme. [Gustcloak Cavalier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Cavalier) went the unusual route of referring to a *Portal* card, [Alaborn Cavalier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alaborn+Cavalier), to go along with the Gustcloak creatures from *Onslaught*.
 ![Angus Mackenzie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angus+Mackenzie)**[Angus Mackenzie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angus+Mackenzie)** – *Legends* rare. Although [Prodigal Sorcerer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Sorcerer) has historically had the nickname "Tim," it seems to us that [Angus Mackenzie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angus+Mackenzie) is much more like the enchanter John Cleese plays in [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monty+Python+and+the+Holy+Grail). He looks a lot more like the movie's Tim, and judging from his name, he's almost certainly Scottish!
 ![Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fist+of+Suns)**[Fist of Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns)** – *Fifth Dawn* rare. If you have a sunburst card with a mana cost less than five (like [Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle) or [Suntouched Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suntouched+Myr)), you can use [Fist of Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns) to still get five counters on it as you play it. Exciting!
 ![Magical Hacker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magical+Hacker)**[Magical Hacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magical+Hacker)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. [Magical Hacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magical+Hacker) does wonderful things with planeswalkers. Clearly. But its effects on levelers aren't entirely clear. Our editors assure us that it's a hyphen (not a minus sign) between the 4 and the 6 of [Lighthouse Chronologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist), so there's no "Level 4+6" available. But you can still change it to "Level 7-", whatever that means.
 ![Caldera Lake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Caldera+Lake)**[Caldera Lake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Lake)** – *Tempest* Rare. A caldera is a crater on the top of a volcao that's caused after an eruption causes the peak to collapse. A caldera lake, then, is what happens when one of those fills with water and you get a lake on top of a mountain. So it's not just a card; it's also a fascinating geological phenomenon!
 ![Scepter of Dominance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scepter+of+Dominance)**[Scepter of Dominance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scepter+of+Dominance)** – *Conflux* Rare. The concept of "dominance" doesn't have a specific meaning in **Magic** card names. It could refer to tapping, [Aura of Dominion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aura%2Bof%2BDominion), [Dominate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dominate), [Graven Dominator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Graven%2BDominator), or [Staff of Domination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Staff%2Bof%2BDomination). The moral is that once you have dominance, you have a lot of options.
 ![Tempest Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tempest+Efreet)**[Tempest Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempest+Efreet)** – *Fourth Edition* Rare. One of the primary rules of **Magic** is that you never put a card someone else owns into your hand. Unless you have a card [Tempest Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempest+Efreet), which actually changes a card's ownership in the middle of a game. Although it doesn't involve ante, [Tempest Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempest+Efreet) is still considered an "ante card" for purposes of banning it from tournament play. You can see why.
 ![Quarum Trench Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Quarum+Trench+Gnomes)**[Quarum Trench Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarum+Trench+Gnomes)** – *Legends* Rare. The original printing of [Quarum Trench Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarum+Trench+Gnomes) contains this mysterious instruction: "Use counters." Is it a recommendation for a way to remember which [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) have been targeted or a deckbuilding suggestion? You decide!
 ![Assassin's Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Assassin%27s+Blade)**[Assassin's Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassin%27s+Blade)** – *Portal* Uncommon. Officially, *Portal* didn't have any instants. So when it came time to add combat tricks, R&D had to invent the idea of a sorcery with specific casting restrictions. When *Portal* was declared Vintage-legal, these spells were mostly changed to instants, which makes a lot more sense.
 ![Unholy Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Unholy+Strength)**[Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength)** – *Fourth Edition* common. When [Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength) went from *Revised* to *Fourth Edition* something changed: it lost the pentagram that was behind the character in its [Unholy Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Unholy%2BStrength). Incidentally, doesn't that character look kind of like [Benalish Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Hero)?
 ![Uphill Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Uphill+Battle)**[Uphill Battle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uphill+Battle)** – *Mercadian Masques* uncommon. [Uphill Battle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uphill+Battle) depicts [Gerrard Capashen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Gerrard%2BCapashen) and [Cho-Manno, Revolutionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Cho-Manno%252C%2BRevolutionary) fighting their way up the spiraling exterior stairs of the [Tower of the Magistrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+of+the+Magistrate) against Mercadian soldiers.
 ![Eland Umbra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eland+Umbra)**[Eland Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eland+Umbra)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* common. An eland is a type of antelope found in Africa. It's also (according to Wikipedia) a city in Wisconsin, an armored car, and a type of turboshaft. But the one referred to by the card [Eland Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eland+Umbra) is the antelope.
 ![Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Leviathan)**[Leviathan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leviathan)** – *Time Spiral* timeshifted. [Leviathan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leviathan) costs nine mana, of which four have to be blue. It's a 10/10 trampler with two drawbacks. It's an interesting comparison to *Rise of the Eldrazi*'s [Artisan of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan+of+Kozilek).
 ![Upwelling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Upwelling)**[Upwelling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upwelling)** – *Tenth Edition* rare. Brian Tinsman created [Upwelling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upwelling) for *Scourge* after looking through the Comprehensive Rules and realizing that rule 300.4 had never been broken before. Its wording has been changed to match up with [Omnath, Locus of Mana](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omnath%2C+Locus+of+Mana).
 ![Leveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Leveler)**[Leveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leveler)** – *Mirrodin* rare. If you zoom way in on [Leveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leveler), you can see a legend. Which one? [This arcana](/en/articles/archive/leveler-art-secret-2005-03-16) from 2005 gives the answer!
 ![Spawnsire of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spawnsire+of+Ulamog)**[Spawnsire of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnsire+of+Ulamog)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* rare. [Spawnsire of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnsire+of+Ulamog) is the first card in **Magic** history to have an activation cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif). It's also (in a casual game) the only card that can put a theoretically unbounded number of creatures into play without any help!
 ![Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gideon+Jura)**[Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* mythic rare. Although [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) is an accomplished mage, he prefers to wade into battle personally, using his *sural* (a unique bladed whip) rather than hide behind his spells.
 ![Mothdust Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mothdust+Changeling)**[Mothdust Changeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothdust+Changeling)** – *Morningtide* common. At some point, we might refer to "the smallest Eldrazi" or something. This is just a reminder that we're not counting Changelings or [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) when we do that. Even though the title of "smallest Eldrazi card" [Amoeboid Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Amoeboid%2BChangeling) [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Fire-Belly%2BChangeling) [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mirror%2BEntity) [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Shapesharer)-[Skeletal Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Skeletal%2BChangeling) [Mothdust Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mothdust%2BChangeling).
 ![Kargan Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kargan+Dragonlord)**[Kargan Dragonlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* mythic rare. Remember, [Kargan Dragonlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) is a Human Warrior, not a Dragon. Even when it's flying and breathing fire, it's not a Dragon!
 ![Goblin Tunneler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Tunneler)**[Goblin Tunneler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Tunneler)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* common. The ability to make creatures with power 2 or less unblockable was in blue ([Crafty Pathmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crafty+Pathmage)) in *Onslaught, Ninth Edition,* and *Tenth Edition*. But it's also got a [Dwarven Nomad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dwarven%2BNomad) of being [Dwarven Warriors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dwarven%2BWarriors) or even [Tawnos's Wand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tawnos%2527s%2BWand).
