This week, we'll begin a regular series of weekly updates detailing how we're working to connect the community to their local game stores, how we're assisting stores, and more things we're doing to support the *Magic: The Gathering* community during a time when "The Gathering" part has become difficult to impossible.


In the meantime, we wanted to roll out a program to begin connecting local game stores to their players as a first step. There's more to come, but we wanted to do something fun to begin forging online connections between you and your local store. That's why this week, we're kicking off Friday Night *Magic* at Home.


Here's how it's going to work—for the next three weekends (and possibly beyond), we will be holding Friday Night *Magic* events on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* but letting stores give out some of the rewards by creating or utilizing existing online communities. (Don't worry—if your store doesn't have an online presence, [we've begun working with stores to help set up Discord servers](https://wpn.wizards.com/article/keeping-communities-close-through-pandemic-1st-step).)


Play at home, connect to your store, earn more rewards.


Let's start with the event details:


FNM at Home (in *MTG Arena*)
============================


**What**: Three FNM events that give all MTG players a place to play familiar experiences.


**When**: March 27, April 3, and April 10, each for 24 hours, running Thursday at midnight to Friday at midnight, PT.


**Who**: Anyone with an *MTG Arena* account (download [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena)!)


**Entry fee**: None


**Formats**:


* March 27—Challenger Decks
	+ Choose between the four preconstructed 2020 Challenger Decks and jump in to challenge others.
* April 3—All Access
	+ Build a deck with any cards in Standard, whether they're in your collection or not. Play others, build more decks, play again. Rinse. Repeat.
* April 10—Historic Brawl
	+ Build a 60-card Brawl deck with your Standard and Historic cards, and battle!

The goal with these formats is to provide fun ways to play in a Friday Night *Magic*-like environment, whether you're downloading *MTG Arena* for the first time or you've been playing since the Open Beta.


But to fully experience these events, you need to connect online with your local game store. Here's how.


How to Get a Reward Code from Your Store
========================================


Some stores have robust online communities, and others will be forming them for the first time. If you're already part of such a community, great! Check with them and get connected.


If you aren't part of a local game store's online community, or if they don't have one set up, there are a couple ways you can get connected. One is to simply reach out to your store and ask (give them a little bit of time—many of them are getting this information today as well). Another is to head to [locator.wizards.com](https://locator.wizards.com/) to find your local game store's website. Not every store has a website on there right now, but our teams here are reaching out to our stores to help them set up options and connect them to our store locator. Many of them will be setting up online communities through [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), so you may have to join or download one of those applications.


Step-by-step, here's how it works:


1. Play in the event (win or lose as much as you want)
2. Take a screenshot of your event page
3. Go to [locator.wizards.com](https://locator.wizards.com/) to find your local game store's website
4. Join their social media channel
5. Share your screenshot with a nice message on their channel
6. Store will message you a code\* through that social media channel

The codes will award special sleeves on *MTG Arena*. They'll look a little something like this:

*\*Note: While supplies last. Not all stores are participating. Limit one code per account. Sharing a screenshot with your local game store does not guarantee you will receive a code.*


We're distributing codes to WPN stores around the world this week, so get connected and talk to your local store about their plans for FNM at Home.


A First Step
============


There is so much more we're working on to connect players to their local stores and communities, and we're hoping this is a strong first step in laying the groundwork for more in the future. Local stores, like so many other small businesses, are going to need our help during this time. Support them however you can, but also make sure you're taking care of yourself by staying connected with friends and local communities.
