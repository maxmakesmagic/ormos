The cold, olive-green scales whose surface eats light itself like the shell of a black hole.

The dull glowing eyes, behind whose forever-deep pits lurk aeons of secret knowledge.

The mighty wings and horns, customarily emblematic of a dragon's glory, but used instead to terrify and overawe the mortal mind.

His form is known on many worlds, and he is known by many names.

Former ruler of the empire of Madara. Scourge of the Umezawa line. The longtime enemy of the dark kami known as the [Myojin of Night's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Night%27s+Reach).

One of the five Elders who survived an ancient war of the dragons, and mightiest of the five.

The most powerful planeswalker alive, even after the Mending left his spark diffused, his mind and power waning.

He's also one of a kind in the card realm.

Planeswalkers and Cycles
Nicol Bolas is not part of a cycle. And yet he sort of is.
