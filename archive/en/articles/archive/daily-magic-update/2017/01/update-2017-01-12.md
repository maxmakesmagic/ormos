The January 12, 2017 Update

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on January 12, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by content creators swapping sites and making debuts today (ish).


Community Spotlights
====================


1. [Draftaholics Anonymous](http://www.draftaholicsanonymous.com/p1p1-aether-revolt/)

The P1P1 feature on this site is *really* cool. On it, you're given the option of two cards with the scenario "Which would you take with the first pick in the draft if you had to choose between the two?" The site then shows *in real time* where the card ranks among all *Aether Revolt* cards based on how people have picked. For example, my selection of [Reverse Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverse+Engineer) over [Oath of Ajani](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Ajani) (because blue) pushed [Reverse Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverse+Engineer) up two spots to #67. And since I can see [Oath of Ajani](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Ajani) is ranked #116, it looks like my choice was roughly in line with how other people are picking!


The website itself has a number of other features that are also worth checking out, but the P1P1 feature is cool, useful, and certainly unique.


1. [It's Time to Get Hyped](http://manadeprived.com/hypeclub-1-time-get-hyped/) | Hype Club | Anthony Cameron and MattyStudios

This looks like it might be the replacement for the recently defunct Heavy Meta. This is the first episode, and its unique aspect is they recorded it while waiting for the Banned and Restricted announcement on Monday. Tune in to about 46:55 to hear their reactions to the announcement in real time.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [CEDTalks: Patrick Sullivan](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34368_CEDTalks-Patrick-Sullivan.html) | StarCityGames.com | Cedric Phillips and Patrick Sullivan

The all-star broadcasting duo catch up on all things *Magic*, Standard, and bannings as CEDTalks returns.


1. [The Sky Isn't Falling](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13728&writer=Brian+Braun-Duin&articledate=1-12-2017) | TCGPlayer | Brian Braun-Duin

The World Champ joins TCGPlayer—and what a time to start. His very first article on the site is about the bannings in Standard and Modern and how, not to give anything away, the sky isn't actually falling. Sorry, spoiler alert.


1. [The Top 10 *Aether Revolt* Cards](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-top-10-aether-revolt-cards/) | ChannelFireball | Mike Sigrist

"Siggy" joins ChannelFireball with *his* first article on their site, running down the cards he believes to be the top in the set. You'll be shocked by number nine!


1. [*Aether Revolt* Set Review: Commons and Uncommons](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-371-aether-revolt-set-review-commons-and-uncommons/) | Limited Resources | Luis Scott-Vargas and Marshall Sutcliffe

Only 3 hours for a commons/uncommons set review, guys? It's like you're not even trying. That's not even half a workday someone has to dedicate to listening to LSV and Marshall digest the bulk of the *Aether Revolt* set for drafting. 6 hours or it's hardly even worth my time.


1. [*Aether Revolt* Rules with Judge Rob](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-207-aether-revolt-rules-w-judge-rob/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

Need some clarification on new *Aether Revolt* mechanics in talking form coming out of your phone or computer? Magic the Amateuring has you covered!


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [The Pivotal Points in Recent *Magic* History](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5nekmg/the_pivotal_points_in_recent_magic_history/)

There was a lengthy Reddit post yesterday wherein a user marked a number of articles we've posted (and one Mark Rosewater Tumblr entry) as key points in *Magic*'s recent development, then walked through the relative power of answers and threats. I point this out because anyone interested in this discussion would do well to read Sam Stoddard's article publishing tomorrow, in which he discusses many of these topics.

It's not often I'll include my own tweets here, but this request garnered more attention than even some preview tweets I've posted. I received a ton of good ideas for this and would love even more. Nothing is set in stone yet, but it's definitely an idea we will be pursuing, so send suggestions my way!


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [White-Blue Ramp](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34354_Aether-Revolt-Standard-Decks.html) | StarCityGames.com | Michael Majors

Yesterday, [Todd Stevens wrote about](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34354_Aether-Revolt-Standard-Decks.html) a deck that [Michael Majors had written about](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34328_Breaking-It-On-Week-Zero.html) (Major's piece requires a Premium subscription) that has gotten me all excited about a different kind of white-blue deck. It's a heavy artifact deck that aims to search up [Inspiring Statuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Statuary) with [Trophy Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Mage) to enable some improvised [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)s. The deck is very heavily *Aether Revolt* influenced, featuring 20 copies of seven different *Aether Revolt* cards. Part of me would like to go a little harder on [Inspiring Statuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Statuary) with some other Eldrazi or possibly Gearhulk-size threats, but the shell of something really cool is definitely there. I'm inspired, at least.
