The September 21, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 21, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by brews. Brews everywhere!


Today's Must
============


1. [20 Standard Brews with *Kaladesh*: #1-10](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/20-standard-brews-with-kaladesh-1-10/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

I guess Karsten felt like he undershot yesterday with just one deck list in his article, so today he has 10, and he's promised another 10 still to come! These decks involve far less math than yesterday's offerings, but far more Dwarves going vroom, vroom.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Top 20 Cards In *Kaladesh*](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33704_Top-20-Cards-In-Kaladesh.html) | StarCityGames | Todd Stevens

What I like about this review, out of the sea of many reviews, is that Stevens starts by checking in on his last Top 20 set review, noting where he hit and where he missed, before diving into his Top 20. The second thing I like is that he has a slightly different take on the top cards than popular opinion, but it's a consistent line of thought that you can definitely find reason in. Let's put it this way—[Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance), is *not* Stevens' top card—though it's pretty close.


1. [*Kaladesh* Pre-Release Primer w/ Judge Rob](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-191-kaladesh-pre-release-primer-w-judge-rob/) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

Posted yesterday after the Update, but still worth bringing up for your Prerelease knowledge download. Learn more about the tricky rules situations you might encounter this weekend, plus discussion of the Crew Phase (best phase) (not a real phase) and the LoadingReadyRun Pre-Prerelease.


1. [*Kaladesh* Set Review](https://rocketjump.com/listen/kaladesh-set-review-123) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

If any format is open to wacky new inventions, it's Commander. Jimmy and Josh break down what the latest set has in store for 99-card decks.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* – *Kaladesh* Pre-Prerelease!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgcDP03OnyY) | LoadingReadyRun

Have some time to spare and the Limited Resources podcast just isn't quite long enough somehow? Well, the nearly 10-hour long pre-Prerelease show is now on YouTube. It goes much faster if you just watch the part where I combine [Panharmonicon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) and [Cloudblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer), and then skip the rest of my matches, as they pretty much are just variations of that oh-so-slow theme.


1. [New Ways to Cook an Egg](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13522&writer=Conley+Woods&articledate=9-21-2016) | TCGPlayer | Conley Woods

Say what you will about the deck Eggs, it was certainly an inventive deck. (If you don't know what the deck is, first, congratulations, second, Woods's deck will give you the low-down). And since we're in a world of invention, Woods sees some possibility in some new *Kaladesh* cards to revive the archetype banned out of existence some time ago. Is this a good thing? Who knows!

1. This week, check out some *Magic Duels* promotions going on.

Starting two days ago, all *Battle for Zendikar* and *Oath of the Gatewatch* boosters are 33% off until 9/26 (i.e. 100 coins instead of the normal 150). Also going on now through 9/26, for Xbox One only, if you purchase coin buncles through the Xbox store, they're up to 40% off (discount based on the size of the coin bundle). Check ‘em out.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Esper Control in Kaladesh Standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkaQCvjwwwY) | Strictly Better MTG

He had me at "Yeah this is my favorite shirt, thanks for asking."


But beyond quips that make you chuckle, there's a very real Esper Control list utilizing five different Planeswalkers and a ton of removal lurking within. He walks through both what Esper Control lists typically contain, and also whether this Standard has the tools to make it work. Take a look.
