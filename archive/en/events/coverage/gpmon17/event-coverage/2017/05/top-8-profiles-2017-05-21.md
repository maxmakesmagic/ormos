**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**



Winning a local 1K?


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Mardu Vehicles, because it has a chance in every match-up and I'm very experienced with it. Also, it's my only Standard deck.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Thalia, Heretic Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Heretic+Cathar) since it messes up the opponent's plans in unexpected ways and is good while curving out.


**What was the most interesting or surprising card you played against this weekend and why?**


[Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer) out of a Marvel opponent's sideboard killed my Planeswalkers when I thought they were safe, which surprised me.

Lots of SCG finishes



 44th GP Louisville 2017



Getting on the PT before Steven Setga


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Mono-Black Zombies because it's very consistent and crushes everything but Marvel, which is probably a 40/60 match-up. I went 8-1 against Marvel in the Swiss and 5-0 against everything else.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


Kalitas won me several games by itself. Post-board with seven one-mana removal spells, it's especially potent.


**What was the most interesting or surprising card you played against this weekend and why?**


Ulamog is very interesting.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**


I have thrown away a lot of opportunities to be great at things in my life. Being here, writing this profile, is my redemption. Today, I proved to myself that my wildest dreams are tangible.

Mardu Vehicles, I think it's good versus Zombies and Control, while not being too bad versus Marvel, although that match-up is quite hard.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Veteran Motorist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Motorist), it dug me out of many unkeepable hands.

I played versus a WU Flash deck, they had [Glory-Bound Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory-Bound+Initiate), it made it kind of hard to race.

Ulamog. The mirror can be quite the Animal Farm, but my Ulamogs walk on two legs, know what I mean?


**What was the most interesting or surprising card you played against this weekend and why?**


[Noxious Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Gearhulk). Didn't know you could put that in your deck.

[Nissa's Renewal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Renewal) – removes the drawback of drawing Ulamogs! Also Marvel is broken!

[Advanced Stitchwing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advanced+Stitchwing) in Round 3. [Magma Spray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray) in game 3 of a Marvel mirror.
