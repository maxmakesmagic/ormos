 In Round 6, Xavir Petit of France was matched against Oyvind Odegaard of Norway. Eight turns into the game, the two got into a dispute over a game situation that lasted a full twenty minutes. Odegaard had attacked with his Goham Djinn, a 5/5 because black was not the most common color among permanents. The statement of the Head Judge, Thomas Bisballe, continues the tale:



> 
> "Xavir, Petit vs. Oyvind Odegaard
> 
> 
> Petit blocked his opponent's Goham Djinn with his Faerie Squadron. Petit's Faerie Squadron was destroyed, leaving black tied for the most common color. Petit argued that the Goham Djinn would be destroyed because it could not regenerate because it was destroyed when it received a -2/-2 penalty instead of lethal damage.
> 
> 
> When Petit was told the correct ruling (the Djinn would be regenerated) he instead then argued that the Djinn would not regenerate because Odegaard did not have an opportunity to play the regeneration ability. Petit claimed that since he put the Faerie Squadron in the graveyard, the damage had resolved and Odegaard would not be able to play the regeneration ability.
> 
> 
> Petit changed his statement that he gave to the judge once Petit learned that he made a rules error. His original statement indicated to me that he had agreed that the Djinn had a regeneration shield. His new statement argued that the Djinn's regeneration ability had never been played and the Odegaard would not have had the chance to play it. I found it suspicious that he, in one swift motion, said "it dies" and put the Faerie Squadron into the graveyard and not provide his opponent time to regenerate or respond.
> Secondly, two people provided evidence to the fact that Petit accepted that the creature regenerated until he discovered it mattered as to whether the Djinn lived or not.
> And third, calling a judge over to tell whether the lived or died when it becomes a 3/3 with a regeneration shield didn't support his side for his second statement.
> 
> 
> Because Petit misrepresented the situation to a judge and changed his story, he was disqualified from the tournament."

* It is important to note that the judges involved had a clear understanding of each player's statement before ruling that the Goham Djinn would regenerate. Petit did not deny the Djinn's regeneration shield until AFTER he had learned that it would regenerate.
* Altering this statement after a ruling is laid down with the intent of gaining an advantage is called Misrepresenting Information, and it is an offense for which the DCI has zero tolerance.
* Because of this, judges are very careful to make sure they are fully aware of what each player means. When conferring with judges, players are given ample opportunity to clarify their understanding of the game situation before a ruling is given. If language is an issue, an interpreter is immediately brought in, so that each player's story will be told as they intend.
* This makes Misrepresenting Information very difficult to do unintentionally. It's hard to pretend you haven't lied when you're denying something you swore was true moments before.
