The tokens and emblems you'll find inside *Core Set 2021* feature all the full-art goodness you've come to expectâ€”but wait . . . what's that? Is that the first-ever Dog token?! Aww, such a good doggo!


If you haven't seen the cards that create these seventeen tokens (and three emblems), head over to the [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/core-set-2021) and check them out for yourself.


Now, without further *paws* (well, at least eight more . . . because, yes, we also love cats), here are the full-art tokens (and emblems) of *Core Set 2021*!
