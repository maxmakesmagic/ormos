![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds02/a544.jpg)Carlos Romao of Brazil and Argentinean National Champion Diego Ostrovich became the first Latin American Players to make Top 8 of a Pro Tour. They did so with equal parts teamwork and resolve. They collaborated with the rest of what has become the Latin Alliance, a group of pros from Venezuala, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. They tested endlessly for the three formats, and now their reward is that one must knock out the other on the way to the finals.

Ostrovich and the rest of the Argentinean team came within a match win of the team finals, but were eliminated by Denmark. Ostrovich carries that drive into this match.

Ostrovich had to take a mulligan to start. Romao matched him, ostensibly for fairness's sake. It was a stop-and-start opening. Romao kicked off, and walked a Familiar into Ostrovich's [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). He had no follow up. Ostrovich made a Familiar of his own. Romao [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)d it.

Ostrovich upped the ante with a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Romao went for another Familiar. Ostrovich Edicted. Romao [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)d to rescue. It was countered. Romao untapped and Edicted back. [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) fetched his [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). 

With that mayhem over with, the two drew and passed for many turns. A [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) from Ostrovich got him a Fact as well. Romao hit eight cards and discarded [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse). He played [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) at the end of Ostrovich's next turn, getting [Underground River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River) and [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) over three islands.

Ostrovich returned the favour. Romao tried to Logic it, with six mana remaining. Ostrovich played a Logic of his own with just five cards in the graveyard. Romao let the stack resolve completlely. Ostrovich got two islands and a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) over [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar) and [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse).

HE untapped and went for the 'Tog. Romao [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed, and it held up. Ostrovich passed it back. Romao busted out [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) before turning it back to Ostrovich. They played a little draw-go. Ostrovich went for [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Romao did not contest it. The split offered was [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), island and [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) versus [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar). Ostrovich took the larger pile.

Now Ostrovich went for another 'Tog. Romao [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed. Ostrovich countered back. Romao took the opportunity to resolve a [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). It was gold. [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse), [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). He got to take [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), Analysis and Wish. The third [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) from hand tried to bust up the stack. Ostrovich played [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) with just three mana remaining. Romao played his final [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). Two [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike)s later the 'Tog resolved, and Ostrovich had two mana remaining.

Romao untapped and played [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). Ostrovich played [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Romao floated nine and used six of it to [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) entered play, and Ostrovich scooped.

Ostrovich started Game 2 with [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) for [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) over [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) and [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). Romao built his mana base, and suffered another [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) two turns later. It stole the Logic and left behind [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds02/a546.jpg)Ostrovich kept his control up with [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). He got a Familiar and two islands over [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). The Familiar hit play, and Romao fetched [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) with the Wish. He untapped and pulled [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). It earned a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). He made no further play. He [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)d the Familiar at the end of turn. Ostrovich played [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) in response. 

He got two [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s over Edict, Logic and Underground river. [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) resolved. Romao found another [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and a [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar). [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) was [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed. The Familiar fell to an Edict. Ostrovich's got to stay. Then he [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe)d with kicker, removing Romao's hand of two cards. He also played [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) with two mana open.  
  
 Romao, naturally, drew another land. Ostrovich played it slow. Romao drew another land. This time Ostrovich went for the kill, evening the score at one game apiece.

Romao 1 - Ostrovich 1

Ostrovich made no alteration to his board for Game 2, neither did Romao. Romao chose to draw, mulliganed, and was stuck with a two-lander. Ostrovich had no problem throwing down four and targetting himself with [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Romao managed to rip two to keep up the pace, but they were [Salt Marsh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salt+Marsh)es, so he was a bit behind.

Ostrovich Analyzed again, and played his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Romao wished for [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) at the end of his turn. Then he went fishing with [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), scoring [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and the [Underground River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River) to cast it. He saw a hand of all gas. Two [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s, [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse), [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe) and [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). He took the [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe) to protect his hand.

Ostrovich played another Analysis. He didn't find the land he was looking for, and had to pitch a 'Tog for damage on the next attack. Romao [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed again, taking Logic over Wish and two [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)s, seeing a 'Tog and a Familiar. Then he Edicted away the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and played a Familiar. Ostrovich dropped another 'Tog and a Familiar.

Romao got some Analysis on. Ostrovich [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)d at end of turn, and Romao returned the favor by bouncing the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Ostrovich replayed it, getting it past [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) with one of his own, then used the Analysis in his graveyard.

Romao found the third [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) waiting for him, and saw [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe), [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) alongside a swamp. He took [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse). Down came his [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar). He passed it back. Ostrovich's [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe) with kicker resolved, catching [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). He attacked. Romao had to block and regenerate against the 'Tog. [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) stole his remaining [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). Another Familiar was insurance for Ostrovich.

Romao Edicted and handed it back. Ostrovich hit for one again and made another Familiar. Romao pulled up [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and passed. Ostrovich Wished up [Opportunity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opportunity) and cast it at end of turn. [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) stopped it.

Ostrovich, low on cards, knew it was time to act. He tapped eight and played [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) with four floating. Romao [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse)d. The extra man set up shields on the Familiars. This left Ostrovich tapped out and gave Romao free reign to play [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). He got three land and an Edict over another [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Ostrovich attacked again. Romao chumped. Ostrovich tried the [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) trick again. Romao Coliseumed into [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).

He was at four. Another attack left him at two. He Wished for [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) to stop the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Edict took out the Familiar, but he had no permanent answer for the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog).

Ostrovich 2 - Romao 1

Ostrovich was stuck at two land early in Game 4. He made a pair of [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar)s and started hitting while Romao made islands. His shortness on black mana meant his [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ess sat useless in his hand. Ostrovich pulled a third land and made a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) got Romao a [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse). His [Salt Marsh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salt+Marsh) was a little too slow. He [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)d the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Ostrovich let it slide and wished for [Mana Short](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short). The [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) came back down.

Finally, Romao got to use one of his [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)es. He saw [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), Edict, [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse), stealing the [Mana Short](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short). Ostrovich's minions brought him to twelve. Ostrovich [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed right back and saw an an all-action hand of [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar) and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). He stole the Wish and burned for one as a result of his Catacombs.

Romao [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed again, this time seeing island, [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse). He took the [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) and triple counted it to make sure he wouldn't fall to an attack. He took another point, falling to eleven, to make [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar). He took three more in an attack and stopped a second [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) with [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic).

He untapped. He stared at his hand and tried [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). It turned over [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse), [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and two land. Romao got the two land and [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse). He ended his turn. Ostrovich swung. Romao blocked as insurance and then played [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) on the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). 

The third [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) stole [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and left Ostrovich with just [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and land in hand. Another attack brought Carlos to four. [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) met [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Romao untapped and made a [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar) and [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). OStrovich attacked and brought him two three life and one available mana. He ended his turn.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds02/a545.jpg)Romao played [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). It scored him Coliseum and Familiar over two Analyses and an Endict. He untapped, played both, and swung with his active Familiar. Ostrovich fired back to put him at 1. Romao let it through. [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) forced his Coliseum, but it just gave him what he needed. He played [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), then Familiar and [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) to take the game.

Ostrovich 2 - Romao 2

Romao's [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) went back to the board for the final game, in place of a [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse). Romao mulliganed. He led with island. Ostrovich revealed his secrets with a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). He saw [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar)[Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Underground River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River). It wasn't a bad Mulligan for Romao.

Ostrovich stripped the Fact or Ficiton. Romao made the Familiar. Another [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) left Romao with a newly-drawn Familiar and [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). He ripped a land and dropped his second Familiar.

Ostrovich passed his third turn without playing a land. When he also missed on his fourth, Romao's spirits began to rise. Finally, he pulled a [Salt Marsh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salt+Marsh) and dropped [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar). Romao hit for two and Edicted him, safe with [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) in hand. He used it to stop [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) on the following turn. Then he dropped one of his own. 

Ostrovich, now with five land, had nothing to say to that. Romao's next attack brought him to five, the cumulative pain of his Rivers adding up. Romao then played [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) twice. He let his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) be [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)d. Ostrovich made no play.

Romao dropped him to three and played his 'Tog. It resolved. Another [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) bought Ostrovich more time. [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) fetched [Mana Short](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short). Ostrovich had seven mana at his disposal on his turn. Three of them were for [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). He passed it back. Romao's [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) got [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). He played it.

Ostrovich split them island and Logic versus [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and Edict. Romao took the Logic and island. Ostrovich tried his [Mana Short](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short). Romao played Logic. Then he made [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), floating one. He played a Familiar and handed it back.

Ostrovich made [Salt Marsh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salt+Marsh), thinking for a minute that he'd find an answer. Down came the 'Tog. Ostrovich extended the hand.

**Final Result:** Carlos Romao defeats Diego Ostrovich 3-2
