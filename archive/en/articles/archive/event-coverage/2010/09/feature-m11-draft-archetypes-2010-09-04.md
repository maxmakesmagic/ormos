People talk all the time about archetypes in Constructed. It's important to estimate the composition of a given field; after all, if your deck beats *everything* but Jund, but 60% of players are playing Jund, you probably ought not to play that deck. It doesn't make a particular difference if one of the Jund lists main-decks one or two [Sarkhan the Mad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+the+Mad), or whether it plays twenty-six or twenty-seven land; what's important is that it's *Jund*, and so you can assume certain things about how the games are going to play out. That's what an archetype is: a class of deck with a coherent strategy, theme, and game plan.


Yet too often in Limited, decks are simply described as "a red-green deck" or "blue-black splashing for a [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)" with no attention given to a broader archetype or strategy. In truth, though, it's possible (and smart!) to draft a deck that, like the best Constructed decks, takes advantage of a particular set of interactions to craft a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. This isn't simply a re-statement of the classic power/synergy debate; it's possible, after all, to have both. But when you're trying to decide between [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) and [Nether Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Horror) for your black-red deck in ***Magic** 2011* Limited, it's not enough to know which card you think is better. You have to be able to figure out what kind of *work* each card can do.

With all of that in mind, I took a walk around to see what archetypes the Pros had favored. I tried to look beyond the color combinations into some specific interactions or themes they had built their decks around—and I stumbled upon some pretty cool stuff!


The first person I ran into was Gabriel Nassif, who was playing against a more controlling black-red attrition deck with multiple discard effects and a smattering of solid removal. Gabe's board was [Augury Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran), a pair of [Silvercoat Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion)s—and only two lands. "He's mana hosed," I immediately thought, but I looked at his graveyard to find that he had discarded his third land to [Liliana's Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter). Apparently, Nassif's white-blue tempo deck was so aggressive and full of early drops that he felt he didn't need more than two mana to operate.

Contrast this style of white-blue to the more controlling defensive builds that favor more expensive creatures like [Azure Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) or [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader), or something even more off-the-wall like Brian Kibler's deck from table one. Kibler explained to me that while he had some solid aggressive fliers like [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin) and a powerful finisher in [Mind Control](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control), what he most wanted to do was stick a [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) and push it through turn after turn with tempo spells like [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), [Aether Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Adept), [Excommunicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excommunicate), and especially [Merfolk Sovereign](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Sovereign).

![Merfolk Sovereign](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Merfolk+Sovereign)

Those differences are fairly subtle, sure, as are the differences between Tomoharu Saito's ultra-aggressive red-green deck (a concoction featuring all of [Goblin Piker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears), [Manic Vandal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal), and [Volcanic Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Strength)) and Conley Woods's version of red-green, which relies on cards like [Sylvan Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Ranger) and [Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) to cast massive bombs like [Yavimaya Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Wurm), [Magma Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Phoenix), and [Protean Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hydra). They're matters of degrees. But I bet you've never drafted a green-white deck like the one that Belgian pro Mark Dictus showed me after Round 1.


At first, I saw a [Garruk's Packleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Packleader) and an [Obstinate Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth) and assumed he was in the green-white midrange fatties deck I've drafted a few times myself. But then I took a look at his *four* [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate)s and knew that something was up. Apparently, Dictus had crafted an entire strategy around his third Pridemate that involved two [Tireless Missionaries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Missionaries), [Solemn Offering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Offering), the aforementioned [Obstinate Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth), and the absolutely insane [Leyline of Vitality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Vitality), which could grow those Pridemates off the charts!

![Leyline of Vitality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Leyline+of+Vitality)

Of course, those aren't the only mind-blowing synergies rearing their heads. Gaudenis Vidugiris has a pair of [Fire Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Servant)s to go with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), a pair of [Lava Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe)s, and his [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball), and it's entirely possible that he can end a game without ever once getting into the Red Zone. Katsuhiro Mori put together a nasty little engine of [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), [Reassembling Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reassembling+Skeleton), and [Conundrum Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conundrum+Sphinx)—and has [Crystal Ball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Ball) and [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) to tie it all together. But my own personal favorite has got to be Guillaume Wafo-Tapa's ultra-slow blue-red control deck that hearkens back to his Pro Tour–Honolulu Standard deck from 2005. Featuring a slew of card-drawing including double [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) + [Merfolk Sovereign](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Sovereign), [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity), and even [Sorcerer's Strongbox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorcerer%27s+Strongbox), Wafo-Tapa can dig with ease into one of his two [Mind Control](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control)s—or, if that's not enough, he can simply choose to end the game right away with a massive [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball).


One thing is for sure: while on the surface M11 Draft is a straightforward, core-set Limited environment, there's room to get a little crazy if you try.
