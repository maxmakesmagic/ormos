The slot allocated to [Rancid Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) in *Torment* was originally going to be used for a creature enchantment, but 11th-hour playtesting showed that black needed another way to deal with the horde of squirrels green was capable of producing. And so [Rancid Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) was born.


Art had already been commissioned for the set at this point, and nothing was suitable for a land destruction card. Luckily, the original art for [Tremble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tremble) had been forced out of *Odyssey* due to some other necessary swaps, and it was without a home.


The original [Tremble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tremble) art showed some dwarves beset by some sort of land destruction, but the effect wasn't "black" enough. So the crack art team added in an evil spell-like effect, and the finished product is the card you all know today.
