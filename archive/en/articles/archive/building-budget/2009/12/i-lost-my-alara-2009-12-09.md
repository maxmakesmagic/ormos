Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






I have been focusing most of my energy on extended since the release of *Zendikar*. Standard on a budget seemed incredibly difficult. [The Specter of Change](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/specter-change-2009-10-21) gave people an interesting alternative to the most popular decks, but even that deck is just Jund with some metagame tweaks. A few of my readers directed my attention to a deck development thread in a **Magic** forum. I read the thread in its entirety and was extraordinairily excited by what I found.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab68_gigantiform.jpg)  
[Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) is not a card I ever thought about for 60-card decks. Creature Auras have been a common pitfall in deck building since the beginning of time. The big issue with these cards is the opportunity for card advantage one creates for one's opponent. An opponent is given a two-for-one opportunity when one casts an Aura spell. A simple [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) or [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) is usually enough to ruin the Aura slinger's day.


![Gigantiform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gigantiform)
  
There have been a few exceptions I can think of, though. [Rancor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor) saw a ton of play in stompy decks because it had a built in defense against the card disadvantage usually accrued by decks with creature enchantments. [Griffin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) was also a playable creature Aura. Simply waiting for an opponent to tap out and slapping a [Griffin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) down was a good enough strategy, even in a block that saw cards like [Slaughter Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact) getting a reasonable amount of play.

[Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) seems strange. It fails to meet any of the tried and true requirements for a playable creature Aura in constructed. If you plan on hard-casting [Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) all day while crossing your fingers you are probably in for a world of hurt. Just about every playable deck in Standard packs a play set of [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), or both. However, the puzzle still has a missing piece.


![Sovereigns of Lost Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara)
  
[Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara) is another card I never would have thought about. In fact, I found five copies of the *Alara Reborn* rare simply by sifting through draft leftovers I had in some shoeboxes. [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara) makes [Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) a lot more attractive. A Bant-style aggro deck can play a lot of must-kill creatures and actually find a way to stick Sovereigns of Lost of Alara until combat.


Lets take a look at what cards might fit in the deck.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab68_theCardsHeader.jpg)  
**[Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform):** Here's the ends.


**[Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara):** Here's the means.


**[Sphinx of Lost Truths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths):** The deck will probably play a lot of mana acceleration and card advantage. Having this as the top end makes the deck a lot more resilient in the long-term.


**[Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid):** I love this card. I want our deck to catch up on the draw and even jump the hurdle on the play. Blocking [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) and living to tell the tale is definitely a plus in this format.


**[Steward of Valeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steward+of+Valeron):** This is probably the weakest link. I still feel like the deck needed more acceleration. I also like having a guy with vigilance that I can make into an 8/8. This card lets me use [Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) offensively and defensively.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab68_theCardsCross1.jpg)  
**[Deft Duelist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft+Duelist):** This card is very undervalued right now. It seems like [Deft Duelist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft+Duelist) is so good against so many decks right now. Playing a single copy of this card blanks all the [Zektar Shrine Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zektar+Shrine+Expedition)s, [Elemental Appeal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental+Appeal)s, [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning)s, [Hellspark Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellspark+Elemental)s, and Bloodbraid Elves your opponent had planned. Definitely a worthwhile inclusion. And because [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara) puts the [Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) straight onto the battlefield, you *can* attach it to [Deft Duelist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft+Duelist), shroud or not.


**[Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger):** Again, I want to hit my land drops to play big things like [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara) and [Sphinx of Lost Truths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths). I also like having expendible guys for the [Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform).


**[Rhox War Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+War+Monk):** This is just a solid dude. It has 4 toughness and lives through [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). It has lifelink, which is just bonkers with [Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform). It also has a very aggressive casting cost for its abilities.


**[Celestial Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Mantle):** I want to have a single copy of this so I can search it up when I have my back against the wall against Jund or red decks.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab68_theCardsCross2.jpg)  
**[Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile):** People still play [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel).


**[Borderposts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Bborderpost%5D):** Playing a good amount of these alongside [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) ensures the card-advantagey goodness of our [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid)s. They also do a pretty good job fixing our mana.

Then he [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)ed my [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) and cast a [Hellspark Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellspark+Elemental) that got in for 3 damage. I drew another [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) and pondered my options.


Casting [Rhox War Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+War+Monk) and [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) seemed like the robot play, but I really wanted to put [Deft Duelist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft+Duelist) on the table before my opponent popped the quest. I decided to play it safe and cast [Deft Duelist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft+Duelist) and [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid), searching up another [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). I played my land and passed the turn. My opponent was pretty stuck at this point. The Shrine was dead so long as [Deft Duelist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft+Duelist) was on the table, and [Hellspark Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellspark+Elemental) looked pretty silly in the graveyard. A timely [Volcanic Fallout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout) could have blown me out, but he wasn't so lucky. He played a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) putting the extra counter on his shrine, cast a [Hell's Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Thunder), attacked me for 4, and passed the turn. I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played my land, and cast [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara). I attacked with my [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) and turned it into an 8/8 with trample and first strike (plus an exalted bonus). My opponent took 9. On his turn he played a fifth land and used the unearth ability on [Hell's Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Thunder) to attack me for another 4, but the next turn I attacked with my 8/8 and searched up a [Celestial Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Mantle) for lethal damage.

My opponent cast a [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) on the first turn and attacked for 2, and I found a free [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). I drew a [Celestial Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Mantle), cast my Borderpost, and passed the turn.

My opponent finally drew a third land and used it to cast a [Hell's Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Thunder) and attack for 4 in the air. On my turn I slapped a [Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) on my [Rhox War Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+War+Monk) and attacked for 9 points of lifelink damage.

From this point forward the game turned into a mess. My opponent had a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) effect or a Day of Judgement for every subsequent turn.

I drew another [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight), cast [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) finding another [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), cast the second [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight), and passed the turn. My opponent failed to find a fifth land and cast another [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), flipping into [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse), which killed my [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger). I drew another [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger) and cast it, I found and played the land. My opponent cast a [Sprouting Thrinax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprouting+Thrinax) and passed the turn back again. I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and cast [Sphinx of Lost Truths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths) with kicker again. I drew [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). My opponent finally drew a fifth land, cast a [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) on the Sphinx, and passed the turn. I drew another [Sphinx of Lost Truths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths). I cast it, kicked, and drew [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), [Fieldmist Borderpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fieldmist+Borderpost), and [Steward of Valeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steward+of+Valeron). I kept one white mana open and passed the turn again. My opponent drew a sixth land and cast [Broodmate Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon). I drew [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara), cast it, and attacked with a [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight), suiting it up with a [Gigantiform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform). My opponent took the 9 damage. On his turn he attacked with both Dragons, and I blocked one and Pathed the other. He cast another [Broodmate Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon) after his attack. I attacked with [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight) again and searched up the [Celestial Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Mantle), and my opponent conceded.

Well, that went pretty well. I think the Jacerator match is entirely winnable after sideboard. It simply important that they don't have a Jace into a [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment+)  with the mana to cast it. The deck's sideboard seemed to work very well. I really like the way this deck approaches the format, and I hope all of you find time to try it out for yourselves. As always, I'd love to see what ideas you guys have in the forums or in email.


Happy brewing!
