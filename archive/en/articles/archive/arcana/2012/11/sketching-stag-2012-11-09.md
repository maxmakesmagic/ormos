Let's talk about [Axebane Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axebane+Stag).


The Creative Team conceived of it as an enormous stag; the sort of thing that you don't want to see in a dark field. I say "field" because it wouldn't fit into an alley:



> 
> Color: Green creature (unguilded)
> 
> 
> Location: Ruined urban area of Ravnica city
> 
> 
> Action: Show a huge creature similar to a megaloceros, a now-extinct giant elk that once roamed Europe. This one stalks through the ruined zones of the city of Ravnica and has tough, armorlike hide. It's huge: about 12 feet (4m) tall at the shoulder, and its massive, battle-scarred antlers are perhaps equally wide. 
> 
> 
> Focus: The giant stag
> 
> 
> Mood: Mean and territorial. A wild creature that has staked out its territory among the buildings of Ravnica.
> 
> 
> Notes: This is Ravnica, so be sure there are buildings visible in the scene.

The piece was assigned to Martina Pilcerova, who turned in this sketch:

That's a good-looking stag. But the card is a 6/7, and that looks like about a 4/5 at the most. So the team asked Martina to make it bigger. So here's the revised version:

Much larger! The Creative Team gave Martina the go-ahead and the final version maintains the stag's scale:

And here's how [Axebane Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axebane+Stag) looks in booster packs of *Return to Ravnica*!
