Last weekend, 1,043 players traveled to [Stockholm, Sweden](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsto14), in order to battle in the third of a four-week-long Standard world tour. Going into the event, the big decks to expect (apart from Jeskai and Abzan) were Red-Green Monsters and Mono-Red, which did well at [Grand Prix Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpla14) the week prior. It was this weekend that Jeskai finally earned a win, as Matej Zatlkaj hoisted the trophy thanks to his plethora of powerful blue, red, and white spells.


And while this has been going on, the current PTQ season also moves forward as players continue to tackle the incredibly deep *Khans of Tarkir* Limited format. There's still time to earn your invitation to Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*, [so be sure to find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-fate-reforged-qualifiers)!
