Let's dabble in one of the darker arts of magic for once. That is, in wild speculation. After all, everyone loves to speculate about future formats, from beginner to seasoned veteran. We decided to listen to a few of the latter for their initial ideas about Standard after the rotation.

**Gold-level pro Christian Calcano:** Red-Green Ramp again because it loses almost nothing in the rotation. You can also still play the Dragon cards, so a control shell with [Silumgar's Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Scorn) and [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) is a reasonable option.

**No. 16 Joel Larsson:** Definitely Red-Green Ramp because it survives the rotation. And Magic R&D already pre-constructed a red-black Vampire madness deck for us. There are also a lot of new planeswalker cards, and most of them are quite good, so some kind of midrange planeswalker deck with the Oath enchantments should work.

***Magic Online* Champion Magnus Lantto:** I think there will mainly be a lot of two-color control and midrange decks. The planeswalkers and removal spells all seem good, but the aggro creatures do not. Two-color decks can punish three-color decks with bad mana.

**Hall of Famer Ben Stark:** I haven't seen all the *Shadows over Innistrad* previews yet, but the [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) ramp deck will likely be a deck to beat after the rotation. It's one of the most popular decks on *Magic Online* now and it doesn't lose much, so it's positioned to only get better.

**Hall of Famer Gabriel Nassif:** I'm not sure about decks to beat, but generally speaking it's mostly going to be one-color and two-color decks. That's different than what we've grown used to. In the new Standard, you actually have to pay a price to add a third color, which can lead to a way wider range of cards that could be played.

**Two-time Pro Tour semifinalist Patrick Dickmann:** Black-Red Vampires. They already have two strong lords in Olivia, Mobilized for War and [Drana, Liberator of Malakir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drana%2C+Liberator+of+Malakir), and it seems as if everyday more and more aggressive Vampires get previewed. Red-green likely is an option, either landfall-based or more midrange-oriented with [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and maybe Arlinn Kord. No idea about control decks yet, but of course that always takes longer.

**Gold-level pro Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** Black-Red Madness/Aggro, a black-green 'The Rock' style deck, Red-Green Ramp, and Esper Dragons.

**No. 18 Martin Dang:** We might see a move toward slower midrange decks. All the new planeswalkers are eminently playable, with Arlinn Kord probably being the best but also the hardest to find a deck for.
