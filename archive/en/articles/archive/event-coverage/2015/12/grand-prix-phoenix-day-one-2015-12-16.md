Although there was a lower than expected turnout for Grand Prix Phoenix most likely due to some of the top players participating in the Magic Invitational in Sydney, it didn't stop the people showing up to the tournament with one of the most diverse field of decks ever. 



Although most pros decided to play Necro-Donate, a.k.a. Trix, there were a variety of decks played with smatterings of Hatred, Sligh, W/U control, Counter-Phoenix, Forbidian and Stasis. There were even some decks that were specifically metagamed for the field, some sporting main deck pyroblasts. The two most popular decks of the tournament were still Trix and Tradewind Survival though.



### Undefeated leaders after day 1


Rob Swarowski - Sligh  

Gabriel Wilson - Necro Donate  

Mark Gordon - R/G beatdown with Direct Damage  

Joel Frank - Counter Sliver  


The next two spots were taken by Tradewind Survival and W/U/g control, which emphasizes the highly diversified field.
