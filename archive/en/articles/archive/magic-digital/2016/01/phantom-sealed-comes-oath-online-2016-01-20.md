Sealed is great. Maybe the greatest. But we think we can make it even better.


Sealed is one of the best way to introduce players to a format, which is why we run Sealed events at Prereleases and some Release events, and one of the reasons Sealed Grand Prix are so popular. People love them some of that new card smell.


Digitally, the same is true (well, except for the smell), but we're changing some of the ways we run Sealed events on *Magic Online* to make the experience even better, especially for the budget-conscious player.


SEALED QUEUES
=============


Sealed is a fun way to play *Magic*, but opening six boosters to play only three matches makes some players feel like they're not getting enough matches in given the cost. Because of this, we have created the Phantom Sealed queue as well as the four-booster Sealed queue.


Let's talked about the Phantom Sealed queue. "Phantom" is a type of *Magic Online* Limited event where players don't keep the cards they open or draft, but the event costs less than it would if you got to keep all of the cards. The Phantom Sealed queue serves an important role in *Magic Online*, and I recommend checking it out if you haven't done so.

*No, not that kind of Phantom.*


We felt the prize structure could be improved a bit. We added a small amount to the total Play Points available as prizes, and moved some around from the other positions so that players who get two wins earn enough Play Points to join another one of these events. These changes will go live on February 17, after *Oath of the Gatewatch* Release events.


Basically, we made it easier to do exactly what you want to be doing: keep playing *Magic*.

Four-booster Sealed, on the other hand, has been less awesome.


Conceived as a way to make events less expensive, four-booster Sealed events gave players four boosters from which to build a 30-card deck. These events have several problems, however.


First, they used a 30-card minimum rather than the 40-card minimum that every other Limited *Magic* format used. Our data shows that a significant number of players submitted 40-card decks even though the deck-building scene information said only 30 cards were necessary. This is confusing and not helpful.


Second, it's clear from the data that players prefer their "cheap Sealed" experience mostly in the other queue. The Phantom Sealed queue fires about six times as often as the four-booster Sealed queue. Additionally, when we look at abandonment rate—a measure of how often players join the queue and then leave it before it fires—we are unhappy with how often this happens with the four-booster Sealed queue.


Finally, we do have a preference for formats tested and developed for play by *Magic* R&D. While R&D tests the six-booster Sealed format used in the Phantom Sealed format, four-booster Sealed is not tested. And why should it be? Outside of *Magic Online*, it's not really played.


For these reasons, we have decided to end our support for four-booster Sealed effective February 1 when *Oath of the Gatewatch* Release events begin. We know some people enjoyed the format, but we believe focusing on the primary Sealed format will lead to a better *Magic Online* experience for most players.
