Forged out of proven, powerful strategies in Standard, Challenger Decks are perfect starting points for anyone wanting to jump into events at their [local game store](https://locator.wizards.com/)â€”and we're releasing another set of four in 2020!

For the uninitiated, Challenger Decks are individual, 75-card decks geared toward Standard play for the Friday Night *Magic* player. Each deck comes with a 60-card main deck and 15-card sideboard and is intended to be playable and competitive at a local level right out of the box. All cards will have been previously printed in Standard and are Standard-legal.


We'll reveal the decklists at a later date, but for now mark your calendars for April 3, 2020, when we release these four decks filled with cards from every Standard-legal set, including *Theros Beyond Death*.
