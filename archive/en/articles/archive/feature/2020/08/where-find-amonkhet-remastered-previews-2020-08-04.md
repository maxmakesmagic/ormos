*Amonkhet Remastered* previews are almost upon us!


This page will help you follow along with everything coming on every day by giving you the outlets we have planned on each day. The goal is to help you find what you're looking for every day.


Below, you'll find a list of dates as well as any outlets previewing a card on that date. Once the previews are live, we'll update this very article so that you can easily find previews once they're up. If the link simply goes to the front of a website or social media site, that means they probably haven't previewed the card yet.


And if you just want to see all the cards that have been officially previewed in one place, you can always check out our [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/amonkhet-remastered). Note that the CIG isn't published as of the posting of this article but will be updated every morning starting Monday, August 10 after the first previews have gone live. For the most up-to-date listings, you can check this page!
