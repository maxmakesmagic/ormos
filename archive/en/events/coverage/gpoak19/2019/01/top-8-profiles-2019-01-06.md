**Name:** Garth Dracoulis


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Owner of Game Den Layton


**Hometown:** Layton, Utah


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Winner of two Utah JSS events


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?** [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales). I've been playing Affinity since Mirrodin constructed and it's in a good place right now.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim). It's fantastic against Burn and [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace). Shut out to Dampening Sphere vs Amulet.


**What does this Top 8 mean for you?** It means a lot. I own a game store and kind of stopped playing to run and focus on that, and it feels wonderful to finally play the game competitively again. I want to thank all the people at Game Den who have supported us and helped us get so far.

**Name:** Hunter Cochran


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Trophy Husband


**Hometown:** Rogers, AR


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** 4 GP Top 8s, 7th place finish at PT 25th Anniversary


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?** KCI, because I believe your win rate is directly proportional to the number of opals, stirrings, and faithless lootings in your deck.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) or the 3rd Sai. Both were clutch in many games.


**What does this Top 8 mean for you?** Another small step toward scoreboarding Allen Wu, and a much appreciated show of friendship from Roman Fusco, who scooped me into Top 8.

**Name:** Steven Haker


**Age:** 16


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Los Angeles, CA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** 8th in Las Vegas Modern Classic


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?** KCI, I'm more comfortable with it than any other deck in Modern.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast). It kills [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice).


**What does this Top 8 mean for you?** It's the first time I've done well in a large event, so a lot.

**Name:** Marshall Jankovsky


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Software Engineer


**Hometown:** Cloverdale, CA

**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?** RG TitanShift. I'm a devoted Valakut player, and RG Shift usually performs best in a broad field.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?** [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage) is always there to bail me out of a bad situation.


**What does this Top 8 mean for you?** Just a few months ago I started making content for Valakut on my website (Eighteen Damage). I've put in a lot of thought and work and it really feels like it's all paid off.
