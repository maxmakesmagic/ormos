Eternal tourist Martin Jůza has done it again, flying ten thousand kilometers across the Atlantic in search for Pro Points from a distant Grand Prix. In response to the "Esper Dragon menace" witnessed at Grand Prix Warsaw, Jůza is adding [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and [Stratus Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Dancer) to the Bant Ojutai shell and his plan was to play the "raptor game" this weekend.


Marcos Paulo de Jesus, who hails from Rio de Janeiro, was also in attendance at Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* in Brussels and Grand Prix Warsaw. Coincidentally, de Jesus also dropped by Jůza's country to attend the Regional Pro Tour Qualifier in the Czech Republic. He did not pick up a blue envelope there and was here in Sao Paulo to try and get one.


With the full set of [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor)s in both decks, this matchup would likely boil down to who could recur more dinosaurs, or break the stalemate with flyers.



**Game One**



Jůza led with [Temple of Plenty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Plenty), allowing him to summon [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). de Jesus replied with a pair of [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor).


Jůza declined to attack, adding a mystery Morph to the board. Of course, de Jesus had to guess what it was, but I took a sneak peek and it was a tricksy [Stratus Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Dancer). When de Jesus added [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) to the board, Jůza flipped it over and flew in through the skies to send it to its gallows.


The tides turned when de Jesus powered out a 7/7 [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra) with the help of [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx), 'cascading' into [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka).

Now that [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) was out of the way, the war of the dinosaurs ensued. de Jesus was able to bring recur his trio of [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) with the help of [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) (manifesting [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix)) and [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic). Jůza had [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and [Stratus Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Dancer) to recur his two.


The difference however was that Jůza was gaining up while turning over his creatures, thanks to Mastery of the Unseen. de Jesus's life total was only going downwards. Eventually, Jůza was able to clinch Game One with the aid of a pair of [Stratus Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Dancer)s.



**Martin Jůza 1 – Marcos Paulo de Jesus 0**




**Game Two**



Both players spent their first couple of turns adding mana dorks to the board, before powering out bombs of their own. de Jesus had [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental), while Jůza decided to race with [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai).


The ground was gummed up quickly soon after, with a bunch of dinosaurs, coursers and lions and whatnot, but de Jesus was unable to interact with [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) that was ripping chunks off his life total.


When he did find [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater), Jůza was ready with [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance). Despite facing multiple [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental)s, Jůza was able to seal the deal with the aid of [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) before a horde of manifested creatures caused any problems.
