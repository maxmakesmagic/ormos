### Comments:


I decided that biological evolution in Epolith was mostly the province of animals, and technological and societal evolution was the province of humanoids.


Flip cards seemed like a good mechanic to revive for Epolith, as they easily support type and subtype changes.


Most people made their own tools in the Stone Age. The common artifacts cost 0 and require creatures to be tapped. This represents Epolithians making tools out of stones and other available materials, including parts of creatures.


The Discoveries represent technological and societal advancements appropriate to the Stone Age, such as the invention of pottery or discovery of fire. These chain together like the Rebels from Masques Block. The tapping of creatures represents the self-sufficiency of the hunter-gatherers; they, not you, are doing the work. Later sets will use other costs to search for Discoveries.


Garruk takes advantage of the difference in how fast time flows between Epolith and elsewhere to engage in long-term breeding projects.


Tyrannosaurus is the ultimate predator, able to separate the weak from the herd. Sometimes he ends up in a fight with King Kong, though! "Rex" implies that he is a Lord, but this lord terrifies the other dinosaurs, sending them in a panicked stampede toward your opponent's territory.


"Spells that evolve" include modal spells, and spells that care about conditions on the battlefield to determine their effects.


For "the perfect pack," I paired each Evolve creature with a spell of the same color that supports that creature's strategy.
