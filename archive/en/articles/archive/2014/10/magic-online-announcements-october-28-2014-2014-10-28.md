Scheduled Maintenance on Certain Wizards Services
On Monday, October 27, at 7:00 p.m. through Tuesday, October 28, at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, several Wizards of the Coast services will be offline for a scheduled upgrade of the account system. **During this time, *Magic Online* should remain available to players.**


Refer to the Friday, October 24, [blog](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online-announcements-october-24-2014-scheduled-downtime) for more details.

Vintage Daily Schedule Changes
In an effort to increase how many Vintage Dailies fire, we've taken a look at the data around which events are the most popular, and are making changes to the schedule to focus Dailies around those times. It’s bad for the growth of the format when players show up to an event hoping it will fire and it doesn’t, so we’re trying to limit how much this happens. Beginning Wednesday, November 5, after the downtime, Vintage Dailies will run on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 11:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., Pacific.


There's plenty more Vintage to come—we haven't forgotten everyone's favorite Eternal format! Keep an eye out for an exciting Vintage announcement coming soon.



 



Vintage Super League
Every Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. Pacific, *Magic* celebrities have been gathering to play Vintage on *Magic Online* and stream the festivities on <twitch.tv/magic>. With a line-up that includes Hall of Famers, Platinum Pros, Vintage celebrities, and vintage celebrities the season has been tremendously fun.


The league is now down to the final week of the regular season and this week will determine who makes the Top 4 play-off, and who finishes last. The standings are incredibly close with eight of the ten players having a record of either 4-4 or 3-5. Incredibly, all eight of those players could actually wind up tied for third through last place! Whatever happens there are likely to be several tiebreaker matches before all the play-off spots are finally determined. Tune in Tuesday to see what happens! You can also catch up on previous weeks (and decks!) at [vintagesuperleague.com](www.vintagesuperleague.com).



 



Last Chance for Redemption
Stock is running low for *Innistrad*, *Dark Ascension*, and *Avacyn Restored* Redemption Sets—all sets that are leaving the *Magic Online* store on Monday, November 3. Don't miss out if you've been planning to redeem!



 



Upcoming Downtime on November 5, 2014
Downtime for *Magic Online* on Wednesday, November 5, will be extended by two hours. Events close at 5:00 a.m. Pacific (13:00 UTC), midnight, and store activity and trades end at 7:45 a.m. Pacific (15:45 UTC) leading up to the system coming down at 8:00 a.m. Pacific (16:00 UTC). The system is estimated to return at 2:00 p.m. Pacific (22:00 UTC).


Please plan ahead!



 



Downtime for October 29, 2014

* All tournaments will close Wednesday, October 29, at 5:00 a.m. Pacific (13:00 UTC)
* Store and trade activity will be suspended at approximately 7:45 a.m. Pacific(15:45 UTC)
* The system will be down from 8:00 a.m. Pacific (16:00 UTC) until 12:00 p.m. Pacific (20:00 UTC)
