Played with my friend Paulo Cortez and talked to a lot of people.

[Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) combo, because it has a lot of raw power and a lot of tutors for answers against the other combo decks

Zoo

Nothing is terrible, it all depends on the builds. I guess some kind of zoo with [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter), or blue control with Vensers.

I like black with either red or blue.
