The **FlavOracle** is a document that houses the official flavor text for every **Magic** card (basic sets, expansion sets, and promotional cards).

Full FlavOracle: [TXT](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/docs/flavoracle.txt) - [DOC](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/docs/flavoracle.doc)

In addition, MagicTheGathering.com is running an ongoing feature that allows readers to submit flavor text for older cards. Each person may submit one entry per card. After a screening process, a popular vote will determine the eventual winner for each card, and the winning text will be added into the FlavOracle.

Currently accepting submissions for: [Aladdin's Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aladdin%27s+Ring) - [SUBMIT](#)[Orcish Artillery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Artillery) - [SUBMIT](#)

Currently in review: [Chaos Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Orb), [Aladdin's Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aladdin%27s+Ring)

Currently voting on: [Morphling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling) - [VOTE](#)

The nominees:

* "I stand alone in this crowd of possibilities as the skeleton key."
* Some reflections aren't confined to a mirror.
* "I've seen my reflection before," remarked Urza. "Only once has it seen me."
* "The only limitation one truly has is one's own preconceived notions. I have no such things, and, as such, no limitations."
* It took a while to confirm the actuality of the Morphling. Many fights broke out over different villagers' descriptions of the "changing beast."
* Many researchers believe that evolution is a long, slow process. In the Morphling's case, it is not.
* "But Urza," Barrin interjected, "it is the poor student who does not exceed his master." Urza responded grimly, "That is what I am afraid of."
* Morphlings were fond of embarrassing fashion-conscious planeswalkers by "wearing" identical outfits at parties.
* Although this replacement for Xantcha had no heartstone, Urza gave it so much more.
* It's not that you won't see it coming. It's that you won't know you did.
