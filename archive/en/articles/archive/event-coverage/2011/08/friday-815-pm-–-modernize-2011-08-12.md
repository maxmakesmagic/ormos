Initially, I wanted to ask around what people thought about the [big announcement](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/155) regarding Modern and its use at Pro Tour Philadelphia. But I didn't even get that far. Instead, I stumbled into a group of players who were already debating the merits of different decks and arguing about this possible new archetype or that combo ...


"Even without [Glimpse of Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature), Elves still might be the fastest combo deck," one player ventured. "You have [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) and [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith)." "No, I'm going to play [Hive Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind)," another chimed in. "Zoo! Zoo! You have all the best Zoo cards, ever!" There were clearly a lot of strong opinions floating around.


"I don't know the specifics, but something with [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and [Glimmerpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpost). Turning four lands with [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) gets you 16 mana, 16 life or any combination thereof. Maybe, one even can work [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) into that ... There are so many cool combinations of creatures: [Terastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terastodon) and [Stormtide Leviathan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormtide+Leviathan)? [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) and [Sky Hussar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sky+Hussar)? Or [Iona, Shield of Emeria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iona%2C+Shield+of+Emeria) with [Painter's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)?"


"Next Level Fae should be good," someone said, and when it was pointed out that [Riptide Laboratory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Laboratory) is not in the format, he clarified: "Well, something blue with counters and [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), anyway." The variety of decks was staggering, and every few seconds the discussion shifted in a new direction, turned from Affinity to Burn to Landfall Boros and on and on.


There was no clear favorite among this particular crowd. If that's any indication, the new format must be wide open, like, really wide open. Also, everyone was extremely excited. One quote summed it all up: "What do I think about Modern at Pro Tour Philadelphia? It bugs me that I didn't try to qualify harder!"
