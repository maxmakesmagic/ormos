A few years ago, Pro Tour Venice Champion Osyp Lebedowicz made another run at a Constructed Pro Tour Top 8 riding the backs of some big, legendary threats. This time it wasn't [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath) that led his squad, but an eight-pack of big blue fliers: [Keiga, the Tide Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star) and [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror).

Regardless of what was coming at him from across the table—whether it was a [Hand of Cruelty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hand+of+Cruelty) or a [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), a fellow [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) or a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)—Osyp was perfectly happy to tap out for [Meloku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku) "the clouded mirror of victory" because, hey... what was the opponent going to do that could really compare?

We haven't heard from [Meloku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku)'s fellow Kamigawa [Moonfolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;subtype=+[amp;quot;Moonfolkamp;quot;]) in some years.

But now, a few years later in the spring of 2012, another five-mana Soratami is revealing herself to the Spike legions of Dominaria... Tamiyo, the Moon Sage!

The first thing that struck me was Tamiyo's picture.

Like I said, she is (like fellow fiver [Meloku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku)) a Soratami.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/td/td190_n971yjviq1.jpg)Tamiyo, the Moon Sage | Art by [Eric Deschamps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Eric+Deschamps%22])

Before even setting up to discuss her Constructed in-game potential, I hassled **DailyMTG.com** editor Trick Jarrett to get some idea of her backstory... I mean, I loved *Kamigawa* block, but we haven't seen this kind of sense on cards in some blocks!

From the *Avacyn Restored* Player's Guide:


> *The moonfolk, or* soratami*, of the plane of Kamigawa are a secretive and inquisitive race. Their knowledge of the metaphysical forces on their own plane is unparalleled. When the field scholar Tamiyo became a Planeswalker, gaining the keys to the Multiverse was greater than any dream she ever had. Each plane seemed to her to be an unexplored trove of knowledge to be brought back to the great scroll-towers of [Oboro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oboro).*
> 
> *For Tamiyo, every plane holds a mystery that sets it apart from all others, and on Innistrad that mystery is the silver moon. Tamiyo has been observing Innistrad for many cycles, using her powers as a Planeswalker to gain insight into the force it exerts on the world. She has watched with rapt attention the moon's effect on the lycanthropic curse, and she has written extensive notes on the ebb and flow of vampire frenzies in relation to the moon's influence. Her curiosity eventually led her to the door of the famed Nephalian astronomancer Jenrik. Tamiyo spent months in his moonstone tower poring over countless charts, adding her own observations to his collection about the odd power the moon holds over the denizens and populace of this plane.*
> 
> *With Avacyn's return, Tamiyo has been excitedly writing theories about the angel's effects on the land, its creatures, and the moon. The nature of the [Helvault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault), the creation of the wolfir, the appearance of the gryffs, and the origins of the newly empowered holy wards are all filling her scrolls with more questions than answers.*
> 
> 

So anyway, I see Tamiyo as a collection of things we all like.
