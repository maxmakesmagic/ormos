### Marcio Carvalho


Marcio Carvalho is well known to players familiar with the European Grand Prix circuit. The 19-year-old Portuguese player has been to the Top 8 of three events including a win at this year's Grand Prix-Lisbon. Most recently he finished second to Olivier Ruel at Grand Prix-Bilbao. Marcio is a rookie as well as a member of his National team. Should he advance in the Top 8 and do well in the team competition, he could surpass Pierre Canali for the Rookie of the Year title.

### Tomohiro Kaji


Tomohiro Kaji was playing in his second Pro Tour Top 8 of the season - he reached Sunday in Atlanta as a member of One Spin. This was his first individual Top 8 although he has had success at the Grand Prix level, most recently winning Kitakyushu. Kaji practices **Magic** for at least two hours every day with friends and on **Magic Online**. He was eager to get a full day of practice in before he would assess his quarterfinal match-up. He was one of four players with perfect records in the Standard portion of the tournament.

### Katsuhiro Mori


Katsuhiro Mori has had success on the Masters Series with his team PS2 but the former Rookie of the Year has never played on Sunday in a Pro Tour. Mori was way out in front of the pack all week long and started Day Three with a full match lead on the next person in the standings. After starting with a win, the wheels threatened to come off when he picked up a draw and then three straight losses. He shook through his final round match and cried with joy when he managed to win his third game against Bas Postema to clinch.

Singapore's Ding Leong is another Grand Prix champion graduating to Pro Tour Top 8 competition. Ding is a perennial member of his National team and qualified for this event as his country's alternate. This is his third trip to a World Championships and the fifth Pro Tour overall. Ding moved through the first two days of competition with solid 4-2 records. He gathered a head of steam on Day Three and reeled off a 5-0-1 record.

### Frank Karsten


The Netherlands' Frank Karsten has been successful in two trips to Japan this season. He finally broke through into the Top 8 earlier this year in Nagoya. Frank's tournament got off to a great start when he rattled off six straight wins with his [Greater Good](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Good) Standard deck. A popular strategy columnist, Frank had actually written about a deck very close to the one he played in his regular column within the last few weeks.


**Age**: 21  
**Hometown**: Eindhoven, The Netherlands  
**Occupation**: Student (Industrial Engineering and management science)


**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour**: ~30?

**Other Previous Magic accomplishments**:  

A lot of top 16/24 PT finishes


**Day One record**: 6-0  
**What Standard deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  
[Greater Good](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Good)/Yosei lockdown, with a [Hana Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) engine in the sideboard. I played it because I wanted to play something similar to KBC Gifts as I had tested a lot with that deck and put up good results with it.


**Day Two record**: 3-2-1  
**What was your draft strategy?**  

I tried to draft Boros or Dimir if possible because I believe these are the strongest archetypes.


**Day Three record**: 3-0-3 (Two IDs)  
**What Extended deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

CAL, because Olivier Ruel told me to play it. He Top 8'ed two GPs with the deck and he believed it was the best.


**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare with?**  

I played with all the other Dutchies and with the Ruels.


**Do you have any interesting stories from the first 18 rounds?**  

I played against Carlos Romao three times this tournament, which is a lot! He never beat me :. And I lost a total of 3 games in the constructed portion, so I'm happy.


**What was your reaction to the Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony?**  

I like the concept, because it gives the game a nice legacy. I hope I will be voted in the Hall of Fame at some point.

### Shuhei Nakamura


Japan's Shuhei Nakamura started his year out with a Top 8 in Columbus and could easily be playing in his third Top 8 at Worlds if not for a narrow miss in Philadelphia on tiebreakers, when he finished 9th. Shuhei was just happy to be in the Top 8 after his miss in Philly and was hoping to improve on his finish from Columbus.

**What was your draft strategy?**  

Play black.


**Day Three record**: 3-2-1  
**What Extended deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

Scepter-Chant. I wouldn't play beatdown because I lost at GPs playing beatdown.


**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare with?**  

Standard, 1 day. Limited: Magic Online every day! Extended: 5 hours


**Do you have any interesting stories from the first 18 rounds?**

It is unbelievable!

### Andre Coimbra


Andre Coimbra was also a member of the Portuguese National team like Marcio. The two players would be getting a little less practice than their Top 8 counterparts. He had to like his chances for teams as he was one of the players to go 6-0 on Day Two after getting off to a weak 3-3 start on Day One. Andre was playing in his very first Pro Tour. His best finish before this event was last weekend in Beijing when he ended up in 17th place.

**What Extended deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

Aggro-Rock, which I like because it fits my style.


**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare with?**  

Draft practice in the Magic Online 8-4 queues, and I played Rock at GP Beijing.


**Do you have any interesting stories from the first 18 rounds?**  

I really thought I had no chance after the first day, but then the draft day seemed quite easy, which got my hope back!

I think it is great.

### Akira Asahara


Akira Asahara is a greatly respected player and deck designer in Japan who has always seemed to be on the cusp of breaking through to his first Top 8. His unorthodox deck approach to deck design served him well this weekend when he went 5-1 with an [Enduring Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal) deck during the Standard portion. He was overjoyed that he finally reached the elimination rounds but was nervous about his chances to advance against a counterspell-based deck in the first round.
