Take the MTGO Survey
--------------------


You've got thoughts and opinions; we want to know them! We're running a *Magic Online* [satisfaction survey](http://sgiz.mobi/s3/27c6cfbd5258) to learn more about what you like and what we could do better. Please take a moment to fill it out and share your thoughts with us—all your feedback is valuable.


The survey will be live through June 29, and can be found [here](http://sgiz.mobi/s3/27c6cfbd5258).

Treasure Chest Updates
----------------------


In case you weren't aware, for the first few days after the *Dominaria* launch, several premium legendary cards from that set were failing to appear in booster packs at the appropriate rate. This means that across the whole *Magic Online* ecosystem, fewer versions exist than we'd intended. We fixed the error after only a few days, but that still left the total numbers for the affected cards lower.


To bring each card from *Dominaria* up to parity with others of the same rarity, we're going to make a small two-week adjustment to Treasure Chests to include copies of those cards. When they appear, they'll replace a Standard-legal common or uncommon, and this adjustment will last until we switch over to the new collation for *Core Set 2019* (which has some exciting new inclusions that we'll talk about soon).


Also worth mentioning: Once the new Treasure Chest collation arrives with M19, the current crop of Treasure Chest avatars will no longer be available; they will be replaced by a single M19 Treasure Chest avatar. If you want any of the current avatars, you'll need to open them in a Treasure Chest soon!


The frequency adjustment is as follows: moving 7% from Standard-legal commons/uncommons to the new *Dominaria* equilibrium sheet in the master table. That sheet is defined in the table below.

Vintage Cube Continues
----------------------


Drafting is already fun, but what if every pack you opened was made up entirely of superpowered cards drawn from the entire history of *Magic*? That's what you get with Vintage Cube. [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) out a [Blightsteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus), draft the full suite of original Moxen, play a five-color storm deck—do whatever your heart desires! This cube has it all.


Vintage Cube runs through July 6. To see the full card list and the most recent changes, go [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).

Team Standard Super League Tonight
----------------------------------


The latest offering in our roster of Team Super League shenanigans is Team Standard Super League. The format is a bit different from the "Conqueror" rules used for TMSL and TVSL, but the basics are the same: team-wide deck-building restrictions, rotating players, and weekly elimination tournaments. See what kinds of crazy brews these teams bring to the table in the world of *Dominaria* Standard!


TSSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).




---

Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!



TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).
