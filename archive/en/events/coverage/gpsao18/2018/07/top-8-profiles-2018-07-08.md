**Occupation:** Architect


**Hometown:** Belo Horizonte, Brazil


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Just got my first Pro Tour qualification via RPTQ.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Red-Green Eldrazi. I wanted to be aggressive but also be able to grind a little.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Eldrazi Obligator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Obligator). It was always on top of the deck on the most critical turns.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Damping Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Sphere). I beat Tron six times and it was responsible for most of my wins.

**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* competitor, Nationals 2017 Top 16, a lot of ninth places.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Affinity. It's the deck I've played the most in Modern, and I feel like it's finally in a good spot in the metagame.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), by a lot. It's the card most responsible for the broken starts. If I could choose a card to always have in my opening hand, it would be this.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion). It allows me to still play an unfair game against decks which try to bring me to a "fair" route. It also carries a Plating like no one.

**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


KCI. I had very poor results playing many decks on *Magic Online*. But with KCI a lot of the losses were due to timeout.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks). With it the dance begins.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim), a 1 mana instant that deals with most of the hate cards.

Mono-Green Tron. It was beating everything in my playtesting, so it made me not play the other decks I was trying and testing.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista), one of the best tools against aggressive and midrange decks. Also, [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Thragtusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk). It's a very good side plan against people who're trying to answer my main plan.

[Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives), it was effective and resolutive.
