![Terry Soh](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi05/sohchamp.jpg)*Congratulations Terry Soh!*Congratulations Terry Soh! You are the [2005 **Magic** Invitational](/en/events/coverage/soh-rides-online-skills-victory) winner. Terry vanquished Resident Genius Tsuyoshi Fujita two formats to one in the Finals, defeating the Japanese star in Vanguard Sealed and Standard. 

Not yet 18 years old, Soh was the R&D pick to attend this event after garnering attention this past year with a couple of Top 8s that were credited to his massive ***Magic** Online* experience. 

The Malaysian wunderkind was near the top of the standings all week and started to pull away from the pack on Thursday with a 5-1 record in the Constructed formats. Terry put in work on every format before the event and was well-prepared throughout the week. The reward for his preparation will be a chance to design a card bearing his likeness in an upcoming expansion. Look for **Jin, the Master of Disruption** sometime next year -- and look out for Terry Soh at the next Pro Tour.
