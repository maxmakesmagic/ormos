Revelation
==========






















![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/events/teamseries/Revelation_Team.jpg)


Revelation represents the other half of the Genesis testing squad. Five out of these six players are from Europe, and the whole team has plenty of Pro Tour experience and many years at the top end of Pro Club status.


**2017-18 Team Standings**


*Note: An italicized team member score is not included in the team's total by event. Only the Top 5 team member results are counted, with the exception of the last Pro Tour of the season.  

An asterisk (\*) next to a player's name means that the player has been substituted off the team in favor of a different player.*  
*Any Pro Tour Pro Point totals in the below standings marked with a hyphen mean that the player's Pro Points did not count for the team's score as of that Pro Tour.*
