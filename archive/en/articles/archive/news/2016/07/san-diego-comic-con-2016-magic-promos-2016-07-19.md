We said the San Diego Comic-Con 2016 *Magic* promos were coming, and I know you've all been looking for them, so I'm not going to waste a lot of space with words and whatnot. I'll just point out that we have also released the [details of *Magic*'s presence in a Daily *Magic* Update from last week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/daily-magic-update/update-2016-07-11), so if you're planning to attend SDCC this year and want to pick up a promo, you should probably stick around and do a few of the other cool things we have in store.


Okay, enough talky-talk. Check out these amazing promos available at San Diego Comic-Con this year (and yes, they are foil)!
