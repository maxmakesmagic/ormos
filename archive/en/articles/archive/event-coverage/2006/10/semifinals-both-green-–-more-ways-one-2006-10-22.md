Bastien Perez is sitting here after demolishing Kenji Tsumura and his white weenies in the quarters, mostly on the back of [Tromp the Domains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tromp+the+Domains) and [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens). Jan-Moritz Merkel had to beat a Japanese superstar of his own to get here, taking down one-time Tsumura teammate Tomoharu Saito - an especially impressive feat for a player attending his very first Pro Tour. In fact, all of the stars in this Top 8 fell in the quarters, leaving the door wide open for one of these two to become **Magic**'s newest poster boy.


Perez led off the match with a suspended [Search for Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) and then [Goblin Skycutter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Skycutter). Merkel was doing just fine, suspending his own [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron) on turn 2. Over the weekend, it was interesting to note that most players, during deckbuilding, were placing their suspend cards at the suspend point in their curves, so cards like [Durkwood Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth) and Ephemeron are being counted as one- and two-drops, a refreshing display of optimism from the often-cynical professional scene. Of course, many games it does replace the creature you'd normally cast on turn 2, so there's certainly a method to the madness.


Perez's Skycutter got in for two but a turn later met an unmorphed [Fathom Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fathom+Seer), as Merkel set himself back two early turns of development in favor of drawing two extra cards. Perez followed up his attack by casting [Herd Gnarr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr), and then [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) a turn later, his fatties now looming menacingly over Merkel's [Looter *il*-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor) and lowly [Fathom Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fathom+Seer). A rawdogged [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) from Perez let [Herd Gnarr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr) get big again, dropping Merkel to 8, and [Tromp the Domains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tromp+the+Domains) earned Perez a kill the turn later.

### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob06/SF_Perez.jpg)*Perez cuts the sky.*Merkel started a bit better in Game 2 than he did in Game 1, putting a face-up [Coral Trickster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Trickster) into play on turn two and a morph on turn 3. Perez was doing alright himself, casting [Gemhide Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemhide+Sliver) and [Wormwood Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wormwood+Dryad), but [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) on a [Thallid Germinator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Germinator) was a bit of a bother. Perez would go on to do nothing further this game and fell quickly under an *Onslaught* of men from Merkel.

Merkel mulliganed for Game 3 but still suspended an [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron) on turn 2. Perez again pulled off the suspended [Search for Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) into turn-three [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) start before playing a [Wormwood Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wormwood+Dryad) and then Ironclaw Orcs, and for the first time in the match we seemed to have a real game. Merkel cast a morph, then [Herd Gnarr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr), and then another morph, trading jabs with Perez via the Gnarr while getting popped back with the Dryad and the Orcs. A [Phantom Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) for Merkel plus the now-lively Ephemeron let him push the aggression, smashing Perez to 10 and killing a Goblin token. Perez counterattacked with his evasion and made the life totals 10-7 in his favor, but it was clear that he was flooding a bit on land and had a razor-thin margin for error. Merkel was able to use [Coral Trickster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Trickster) to stave off a turn of Dryad beats while continuing to add creatures to the board, and that was enough time to attack for the win, putting Perez on the brink of elimination.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob06/SF_Merkel.jpg)*Jan-Moritz always looks worried.*Perez sighed deeply when he was forced to mulligan his opening hand in Game 4, keeping the six-card hand but reacting as if it was lacking as well. To make matters worse, Merkel hit his curve on turns two, three, and four, putting [Looter *il*-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor), [Prodigal Sorcerer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Sorcerer), and [Herd Gnarr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr) into play. Perez wasn't without some action, playing [Wormwood Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wormwood+Dryad) on turn 3 (Prodigal Sorceror got it a turn later), a [Herd Gnarr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr) of his own, and another rawdogged [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens). Unfortunately, that was it for him, while Merkel pushed the peddle to the floor with [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd). Perez simply shrugged and extended his hand, congratulating Merkel on his trip to the finals.
