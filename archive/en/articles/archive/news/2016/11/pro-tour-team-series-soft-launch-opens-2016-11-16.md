 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






Earlier this year, we announced a new program that Pro Tour competitors have the option to participate in during their regular season. This program—which is in addition to any individual prizes or success players might earn—rewards the performance of a group of players—a team, if you will. And now it's time to discuss the details of how the first iteration of that program will work.


[The Pro Tour Team Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/state-organized-play-pt-kaladesh-2016-10-06) rewards players who have prepared with a team by offering a cash prize to top finishing teams that qualify for the Pro Tour Team Series Finals to be held at the 2017 World Championship.


While the program will officially roll out with Pro Tour Albuquerque November 3–5, 2017 at the start of the 2017–18 season, we will be conducting a soft launch in this premier play season starting with Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*. The soft launch will last through three Pro Tours, and the Top 2 finishing teams at the end of the 2016–17 season will be invited to compete in the Pro Tour Team Series Final held at the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship October 5–8, 2017 in Boston, Massachusetts, for their share of a prize pool totaling just over $50,000.


Today, we have published the Pro Tour Team Series Eligibility and Rules, and are opening up enrollment for teams of six that wish to participate. **The deadline to register your team in time for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* is January 13, 2017.**


We hope that during this soft launch, your participation and feedback will help us launch a successful program for the 2017–18 season as we iterate on the program.


We'll be closely monitoring feedback on the Team Series from participants and viewers, so if you have questions or concerns, let us know via the [@MagicProTour](https://twitter.com/magicprotour) Twitter account or by emailing the premier play inbox referenced in the Pro Tour Team Series Eligibility and Rules! In the event we're getting recurring questions, we will address with an amendment to this article and alert people through social media and the [Organized Play Tumblr](http://magicorganizedplay.tumblr.com/).


Apply for the Pro Tour Team Series Soft Launch
==============================================

Teams can apply to participate in the *Magic: The Gathering* Pro Tour Team Series soft launch starting with Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* by having the team captain email [premierplay@wizards.com](mailto:premierplay@wizards.com) with their team roster (names and DCI numbers), team name, and team logo by **January 13, 2017**. Any submissions after that date will be considered late registrations for Pro Tour *Amonkhet*, and the team will not score points through results at Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*.


For all application requirements, please read the Pro Tour Team Series Eligibility and Rules.


Upon approval of a team application, we will email all members of the team with a confirmation letter. Once that's done, that's it! You're approved and ready to go for the 2016–17 soft launch.


By participating in the *Magic* Pro Tour Team Series, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and will comply with the [*Magic* Pro Tour Team Series Eligibility and Rules document](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/Pro%20Tour%20Team%20Series%20Eligibility%20and%20Rules.pdf), and will continue to comply with the [*Magic* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) and Wizards of the Coast's [Code of Conduct](http://company.wizards.com/legal/code-conduct), [Terms of Use](http://company.wizards.com/legal/terms-use), and [Privacy Policy](http://company.wizards.com/legal/wizards-coasts-privacy-policy).


For the soft launch, we are aware that the window between this registration and when the Pro Tour takes place is a narrow one. We acknowledge that the time it may take to fully prepare for the Team Series in accordance to the Eligibility and Rules may not be reasonable, so any applications we receive for the soft launch will also have some relaxed enforcement of the following:


* In the event a team is unable to secure final uniforms for all team members by Pro Tour *Aether Revolt,* please let us know beforehand. We may grant exceptions to teams for this Pro Tour, but it is expected that registered teams conform with all the uniform policy by Pro Tour *Amonkhet*.
* We will be relaxing the proposed uniform policy with regard to T-shirts for the soft launch.

Again, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us [through official channels](http://www.twitter.com/magicprotour).


We look forward to seeing your applications, and we'll see many of you at Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*!
