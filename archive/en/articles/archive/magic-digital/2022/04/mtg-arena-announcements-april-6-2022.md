Tabletop Pro Tour Returns
=========================


Tabletop *Magic* competitions are back with the  [return of the Pro Tour](https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-your-path-to-playing-magic-at-the-highest-level)  ! No matter your experience, you can try your hand at qualifying (within eligibility requirements)—this is about proving who is the best *Magic* player.


You can qualify for the Pro Tour in *MTG Arena*, too—we'll have details on how coming later this month, so stay tuned!


Decked-Out Decks
================


Express yourself with a full cosmetic outfitting of your decks by associating avatars, pets, and sleeves with them! Now you'll have a complete ensemble when you take a deck into battle.


By default, these three are set to the selections made in your Profile. You can assign a specific avatar, pet, and card sleeve to a deck by editing it in the deck builder and entering the Deck Details scene.


![Deck Details scene with options to add an avatar, a pet, and a card sleeve to a deck](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/sp8s47eduhd.jpg)


We do want to call out that favoriting basic lands, although not included in this feature update, is someone we're working towards.


*Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Mythic Booster Packs Now in the Store
==============================================================


The *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Mythic Booster packs are now available in the Store:


* 1 *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Mythic Booster pack for 1,300 gold
* 10 *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Mythic Booster packs for 2,600 gems

*Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*  Mythic Booster packs ensure that the card in the rare or mythic rare slot is always a mythic rare (unless it is replaced by a wildcard). These should help collectors who have completed their collection of rares for this set but are still missing mythic rare cards.


20-Pack *Alchemy: Kamigawa* Bundle Available Now
================================================


You can now find a single-purchase 20-pack *Alchemy: Kamigawa* bundle for 15,000 gold or 3,000 gems in the Store. This bundle will give you a boost as you add *Alchemy: Kamigawa* cards to your collection, but it can only be purchased once.


[Check out the new *Alchemy: Kamigawa* cards](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/alchemy-kamigawa)  to see what you can get!


Upcoming Alchemy Balance Changes
================================


As part of the April 7 game update, we are planning to rebalance several cards in Alchemy. Since this is very close to a Qualifier Weekend, we want to give players as much notice as possible. Check out  [the latest rebalancing changes coming on Thursday, April 7](https://magic.wizards.com/mtga-alchemy-latest-changes)  .


There is one additional minor card change coming on April 7, too:


**Blood Artist**


Changed "target player" to "target opponent"


![Rebalanced Blood Artist](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/81229_Printed_A-BloodArtist.png)


This is a quality-of-life improvement, making it so players don't have to select a target each time Blood Artist triggers.


Try the Latest Changes Event
----------------------------


You'll also find a new event, Try the Latest Changes, that runs April 7–9. This is an All-Access event so you can try out cards and decks even if you don't have them in your collection.


There is a visual bug to note: If you import a deck to your deck builder that contains cards you don't own and submit the deck for the event, it will appear as if those cards are still missing. This is *not* the case since this is an All-Access event—you can still play with the deck!


Arena Open Returns April 16–17
==============================


The next Arena Open kicks off on Saturday, April 16. This two-day event will feature competition in the Historic format, and all participants will receive the Neon Samurai card sleeve:

Check out the  [Arena Open page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/april-arena-open-historic-2022-03-30)  details!


*Tinkerer's Cube* April 15–28
=============================


The *Tinkerer's Cube* is back beginning Friday, April 15, and continuing through April 28. Draft three 14-card packs for Best-of-One and Best-of-Three matches with a chance to win gold and Historic individual card rewards! This is a Phantom event, so drafted cards are not added to your collection.
