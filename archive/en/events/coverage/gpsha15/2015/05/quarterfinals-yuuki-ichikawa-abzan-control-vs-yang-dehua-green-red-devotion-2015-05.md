Platinum Pro Yuuki Ichikawa is playing in his third Grand Prix Top 8. Yang Dehua was playing in his first. This matchup promised to be rather exciting. Both decks had great bombs and an excellent end game. Who would prevail? Let's find out!


Game 1
======


Yang had a great start, leading with [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Ichikawa replied with [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) of his own.


When Yang presented [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix), Ichikawa had [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) to send it away.


However, Ichikawa's deck offered little pressure and that gave Yang a lot of time to set up his late game plays. Ichikawa used [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to bin [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka), but Yang was ready with another copy.

That wasn't quite the end of it though. Despite his board being decimated by Atarka, Ichikawa had another [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) to exile it. However, Yang had [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) to resurrect [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) (the copy that was discarded with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)) and Ichikawa was quickly put on a fast clock.


**Yuuki Ichikawa 0 – Yang Dehua 1**


Game 2
======


The second game was over in a matter of minutes. Yang was forced to mulligan to five, and stopped drawing lands after his second one. He did have [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), but unfortunately, many of the cards in his hand cost four or more.


Ichikawa quickly equalled the score with a pair of [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector).


**Yuuki Ichikawa 1 – Yang Dehua 1**


Game 3
======


Despite having a healthy number of mana dorks in his deck, Yang was forced to pass his second turn with none of the accelerants in his hand. This was great news for Ichikawa, who used the breathing room to play a trio of tapped lands, getting his mana issues out of the way.


The first spell of the rubber game was from Yang, a turn-four [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent). Ichikawa wasted no time, pointing [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) at it.

Ichikawa then summoned [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), while Yang replied with [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler). A timely [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) turned the 2/4 into a 3/5 and fought with the opposing satyr. That cleared the path to send Xenagos to his death.


A second [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) met the same fate as the first, but Yang had [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) in an attempt to win the attrition war. Ichikawa didn't want to wait to be buried by the incoming card advantage. To play the long game would be suicide.


He wasted no time expending a pair of [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm)s to put four +1/+1 counters on his [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor).Then, [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) returned [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) from the yard, adding yet another two +1/+1 counters to his team.


Yang was unable to deal with the pair of fatties and extended his hand.


**Yuuki Ichikawa 2 – Yang Dehua 1**


**Yuuki Ichikawa defeats Yang Dehua and advances to the semifinals.**
