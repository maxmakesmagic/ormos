![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/971.jpg)Svante Landgraf is a Swedish player known for his deck building skills who managed a top 8 at GP Oslo last year with an unorthodox Dark Solution deck. Jan Tomcani is a solid player from the Slovak Republic who made the top 8 of world’s last year.

Tomcani is running the blue-green flashback deck using [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) to load up his graveyard with [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) and [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate). Landgraf is running blue-black [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)/Infestation.

Tomcani took a look at his opening hand and immediately tossed it straight back. The six cards were better and he immediately made up the deficit by chucking a [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) into the graveyard with [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study). He didn’t really get any early pressure, not summoning anything until baiting out an edict with a [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) on turn 4. The Roar that followed was [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)ed and Landgraf looked fairly solid with a [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) on the table and then casting [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).

This left Landgraf with just a swamp open and Tomcani took the opportunity to fill up a monster graveyard with two [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation)s. A Wurm was the first to hit the table, with Mongrel as edict bait. Now Landgraf didn’t look too comfortable and cycled cards off [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) to find answers.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/970.jpg)Two Edicts did the job and an [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) was on hand to take down a [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate). A Logic took down a second the turn afterwards but as he was stuck on one island the Swede couldn’t gain a card off it. Tomcani was always careful to leave an island open to [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) any possible [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).

Landgraf dropped Infestation then [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) to try and claw back some advantage. Finally a [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate) resolved and Landgraf was facing 4 bears. Yet another edict reduced the number somewhat but Tomcani kept cranking out threats – another Mongrel and a Wurm token from his stocked graveyard.

[Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) took care of the Wurm but there was still plenty of trouble. Landgraf was forced to ask the question. He tapped 7 mana and went for the big Ups. As anticipated Tomcani had [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) as an answer and it was onto game 2.

Tomcani 1-0 Landgraf.

 Landgraf started well, [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)ing Tomcani’s turn one [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and dropping [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) on turn 2. Tomcani broke it immediately, taking the opportunity to put [Acorn Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest), Roar and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) in his graveyard with [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation). [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) appeared on the Swede’s side while Tomcani developed his hand with the Analysis and then hitting another Roar with [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note). He flashed back the Harvest and a second Speculation ran into an [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) from Landgraf.

Mr Toothy Grin ate a squirrel and the first Roar never appeared as Landgraf Synced it. The second hung around as Tomcani protected it from Edict with an [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop). He followed it with [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate) and still had an island left open to represent [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop).

Landgraf tried to draw it with [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate), first making his Tog bigger. Tomcani let the bears die. He struck with the Wurm and then pre-empted Landgraf’s possible [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) with one of his own.

A [Catalyst Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catalyst+Stone)[Accelerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accelerate)d out a Wurm but Landgraf had an [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood). A [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) for Tomcani’s [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate) allowed Landgraf time to bring back the Tog. It didn’t look quite as good as Tomcani got a [Grizzly Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate) to resolve with the threat of it being flashed straight back again the next turn. Landgraf summoned a second Tog and tried to think of a way to slip one through. Tog’s and [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) reduced the bear population to one until Tomcani flashed back Fate to bring it back up to 5. Togs stayed back on defence but couldn’t hold back the marauding bears.

Jan Tomcani beat Svante Landgraf 2-0.
