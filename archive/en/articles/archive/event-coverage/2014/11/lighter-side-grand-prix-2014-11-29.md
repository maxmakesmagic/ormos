There's some great camaraderie going around here, and some great fun. There's so much awesome *Magic* going on, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle of cards. So I thought we'd just take a look at the lighter side of Grand Prix San Antonio for a minute.


For example, here's a group of players representing Top Deck Gaming Center here in San Antonio. I thought they might have been some local ringers I'd yet to meet based on their wear, until I saw "Team Super Casual" embroidered on the front of the shirts right above each of the individual names.

Allison Brannan, Julian Bruneault, David Pizzini, and Steve Smith had been playing at this game store "back when they were a baby store," Pizzini said. Originally drawn in by a box of commons they "spent hours looking over" when they first started playing, they've been supporting the store ever since. In that time the store has expanded three times, and Team Super Casual has started attending larger events than their "Build-A-Deck-Around-A-Nephilim-With-A-Budget-Of-$15" days.


 


However, they are not made for the Grand Prix quite yet. After a few rounds of play, they lived up to their team name. But great gaming wear!

Next, I ran into Christine Sprankle and her adoring fans.

I had to wait in a line to talk to her, just like all the other fans, but I got a good shot of her and her self-named, "Handler." Though she was representing the planeswalker [Nissa Revane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa+Revane) today, she said "Oh, [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) will make an appearance tomorrow."

And last, but certainly not least, I finally perused artist rk post's now-extensive collection of tokens.

He's been making tokens for just about anything people want—he really likes the squids.

And he's even started making custom tokens for each Grand Prix event! This one features the official roadkill of Texas—the armadillo. Signed and uniquely numbered, these things were going like hot cakes.

So there's just a quick look at the non-game stuff going on today. There's plenty of words and hours of video devoted to that, sometimes it's just cool to look at fun stuff.


 


Man, the Grand Prix is fun!
