Both of these players were 6-0 coming into the second day of competition, along with Alexandre Peset. Olivier was unhappy with his deck as he showed it to me before the match, " My neighbour was white-red too ". There is indeed a lot of filler in there, but he has a Warhammer and a [Beacon of Destruction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destruction) as stand-out cards. Franck's deck is a fairly solid black-white affair. ### Game 1


![Fleshgrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fleshgrafter)
Olivier drew only red lands making his first play a turn 4 [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) which didn't even get to swing as Franck had a [Fleshgrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshgrafter). Franck attacked with the [Fleshgrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshgrafter) and cast [Devour in Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Shadow) on the Berserker. He followed with a [Titanium Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem) which was destroyed by [Beacon of Destruction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destruction). Olivier still only had [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s in play. Franck dropped a third swamp and played [Greater Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Harvester). Since he had exactly zero castable spells in hand at this point, Ruel just scooped on the spot.

### Game 2


Olivier had lands of both colors in his opening hand this game, and Canu had to take a mulligan. Ruel played a third turn [Thermal Navigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Navigator) and followed with his [Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer). Canu's black-white deck had nothing to deal with the equipment, but he blocked the Navigator with a [Nim Shambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shambler) and regenerated it with his [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker). Olivier had a good hand of land, [Myr Incubator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator), and [Beacon of Destruction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destruction), so Franck's [Fill with Fright](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fill+with+Fright) was very timely. Of course Olivier kept the Incubator and ripped a land on his next draw phase to cast it. Canu did nothing and Olivier made eleven 1/1s. As far as I couold remember Franck's deck was drawing dead against multiple creatures, no [Wail of the Nim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wail+of+the+Nim) or [Echoing Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay).


He stayed alive for a couple of turns by trading with his [Nim Shambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shambler) and casting a few Pulses of the Fields, but didn't draw any of his zero outs and it was on to the deciding game.

### Game 3


Once again Franck went down to six cards. He had a turn four [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) and Olivier accelerated out a [Loxodon Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) with [Gold Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) and [Talisman of Unity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Unity). Franck arrested the Mystic and attacked before playing a [Cackling Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cackling+Imp). Ruel made a five mana [Oxidda Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem) and two [Arcbound Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger)s. Canu played a [Whispersilk Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak) and attacked Olivier down to nine with the [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem). Ruel had a [Beacon of Destruction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destruction) in hand but only one [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) in play.


![Cackling Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cackling+Imp)
He played a [Whispersilk Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak) of his own, put it on the Golem and put a [Horned Helm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horned+Helm) on one of the Stingers and attacked. Canu didnt want to trade [Cackling Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cackling+Imp) for Stinger so he took the hit down to 11. He used the Imp and just attacked with the [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) again knocking Olivier to 5. Ruel thought for a while after drawing his card, [Thermal Navigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Navigator), but he there wasn't any way he could do near 11 damage. He made a random alpha strike nonetheless and conceded after it only knocked Franck to 5.
