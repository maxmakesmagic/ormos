 Ian Farnung comes into the Top 8 here with the dubious distinction of being the only member of the eight undefeated players from day one to make it all the way to the final draft here on day two. He's appearing in his second Grand Prix Top 8, having finished 4th in Sao Paulo earlier this year. On the opposite side of the table is Melissa DeTora. She is also in her second GP Top 8, having made the final eight at Chile in 2011. She has the edge in big game experience, however, since she has a Pro Tour Top 8 to her name, from Pro Tour *Gatecrash*.




**Game 1**




 DeTora was the more active in the early game, although playing multiple Banners might be stretching the definition of 'active'. At least there was a [Bear's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear%27s+Companion) too. [Tusked Colossodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tusked+Colossodon) dwarfs a lot of things, and it certainly dwarfed Farnung's Jeskai board, which was, to put it bluntly, unimpressive. As you'd expect, however, his deck was full of spells designed to make his creatures somewhat less unimpressive. [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) and [Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance) certainly helped his cause.
