Join us in scenic Vancouver, British Columbia for an early summer Grand Prix, where angels and demons will clash on the battlefield over two days of *Avacyn Restored*  Limited play. The Convention Center is located in beautiful downtown Vancouver, directly on the harbour. 


The event will feature promotional items (playmats, foils), a full slate of side events, vendors, artists, and everything else you've come to expect from a Grand Prix. And when the cards are put away, the city offers amazing food, beautiful sights, exciting night life, and a host of other amenities all within close proximity to the venue and nearby hotels.



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2012).*

Players must have a signed publicity release form to be included in Wizards of the Coast's official online event coverage. Forms can be downloaded [here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/publicityrelease_grandprix_2011.pdf) (15k PDF) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Publicity releases will be collected during registration.


**Tournament Format**
  


* [Day 1: Sealed Deck](/en/node/704561)  (6 packs of *Avacyn Restored*)
* [Day 2 and Top 8: Booster Draft](/en/node/704561) (3 packs of *Avacyn Restored*)
* Deck lists are required.
* If product is not stamped or preregistered, deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the Swiss Sealed Deck.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

**Judges**
  
 The Head Judge for this event will be Cristiana Dionisio. To volunteer as a judge for this event, please log in to [DCI Family](http://www.dcifamily.org/), and apply to the GP Vancouver Judge staff under the Events tab.

### Travel Information


**From Vancouver International Airport [YVR]:**
  
 One of the legacies from the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver is the "Skytrain - Canada Line" - an elevated light rail transit directly from the YVR International Airport to the downtown core of Vancouver that connects to within 1 block of the event site. Most arrivals at the airport can use this option as it is fast, direct, and very affordable ($5). Fare for a cab is about $30 from the airport to the downtown core and Convention Center area. 


**From Bellingham International Airport [BLI]:** 
  
 Travellers from the USA may find airfare to Bellingham and rental car cheaper than flying directly into Vancouver. If flying in from the USA you should also investigate flying to Bellingham + rental car for your travel plans. Bellingham is about 20 minutes south of the Canada-USA border on Interstate 5/I-5. 


**By Car**
  
 From the south:   
 Continue North on I-5 toward the Canada-USA border.   
 Take SR-543 (Truck crossing) and cross into Canada.   
 Continue north on Highway 15/176 street until you reach Highway 1 (a 10 minute drive).   
 Head West on Highway 1; it will take you right into the downtown core of Vancouver.


 From the east:   
 Follow the signs for Highway 1 - it will take you right into the downtown core of Vancouver.
