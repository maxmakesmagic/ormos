Still Rareless, Still Careless
==============================

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






I've received a lot of email asking for a post–*New Phyrexia* version of "Rareless and Careless," a deck I had worked on a few months ago. A lot of newer players may be wary of entering the fray of Constructed **Magic** without access to powerful spells like [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) or [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan).

These fears are usually misconceived, though. Local Standard tournaments are a great place to start your Constructed **Magic** career. There are always a good number of players just starting out. Best of all, it's possible to be competitive at these events with decks you can put together easily.

Rareless and Careless is an attempt to make a competitive Standard deck that doesn't play a single rare or mythic rare in the entire 75. Red and blue still offer the best options at the common and uncommon rarities. Blue provides us with card advantage and library manipulation while red provides us with removal. I want to build the deck in a manner that teaches the pilot how to understand and profitably manipulate a very wide array of situations.

Let's start by taking a look at the original deck list.

The format has changed a great deal since the original publication of Rareless and Careless. With the printing of [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), Caw-Blade has gone from a tier 1 deck to the most terrifying thing you've ever seen. Luckily, this archetype has enough burn to ensure that one will have the burn spell for the [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) to at least delay [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) from entering the fray.

[Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) was very good at stabilizing against decks like Boros and Kuldotha Red. Neither of those decks seems to be a threat anymore. It's time we switched the [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) to another card that might be better in the current format.

If one looks at the most successful Standard decks of the past few weeks, one will immediately notice a common trend. Most decks have stopped running spot removal like [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) or [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn). Most decks have also stopped toying around with [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura). These two factors make [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) an excellent inclusion that increases the consistency with which we have an [Ophidian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ophidian)-like creature to cast on the third turn. I also found myself having issues with cards like [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), and [Searing Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze); it's difficult to have perfect mana, and these cards really put an unnecessary strain on the mana base. [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando) is powerful enough to defend its inclusion here, but the other cards are definitely getting cut.

It's also worth noting that the current lack of removal and Gideon in the format is hugely beneficial to your [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend) draws. I wouldn't even play around [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) anymore.

"Do you have one of those two [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn)s that are in your deck? No? Okay, you're dead."

The new version of the deck is specifically designed to make you a better **Magic** player. [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) lets you know your role. Sometimes, you'll want to function as a control deck. You know your opponent is going to cast a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) on a key turn with [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) backup so you don't cast your second creature, leaving you with enough mana to cast [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and pay for the [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). You know your opponent has an aggressive draw so you manipulate him or her into giving you a few two-for-ones with your [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail)s or [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt)s. It becomes clear that you can play a very aggressive game and use your burn to end the game very quickly. The information granted by [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) is huge here.

Playing only 20 lands seems very scary these days, but the deck doesn't have any cards that cost more than three, and it only plays ten that cost three. The overwhelming majority of the cards in the deck only cost one mana, this allows to deck to receive a strange sort of card advantage. It draws less land and more spells than the opponent, it just needs to carefully use each inexpensive spell in a way that remains on par with the more expensive plays of the opponent.

[Crush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush) is necessary in a world of [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) and [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace). Your deck has enough burn to keep the sword in check, but the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) can be a real issue if it resolves or is put into play.

[Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) is necessary if we want to have a chance against [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut) decks and certain Blue-Red-Green variants. I wouldn't bother sideboarding all four of this card against [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) decks or Elf decks. You already crush Elf decks with cards like [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt), [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), and [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail), and too many copies of [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) will just make your draws clunky.

We upgrade our [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail)s to [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) and [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive) when playing against [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) decks.

Let's play some games!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab145_pulse.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), 2 [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail), [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), and [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando). My opponent played a [Blackcleave Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs), cast a [Pulse Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker), and passed the turn. I drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), played my [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), and passed the turn. My opponent attacked with [Pulse Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker) and I fell to 18, then he played his land and cast [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn). I popped my [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and found a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) on his end step. I drew a Lighting Bolt, played an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) dispatching both Vampires, and passed the turn. My opponent played an [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) and took my [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), then cast [Vampire Lacerator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator) and passed the turn. I drew a [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend), cast it, and passed the turn. My opponent went to 19, cast a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) targeting the [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend), and attacked. I cast [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) to dispatch the 2/2, and he passed the turn.

I drew a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), cast [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), found a [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), put it on top to draw it, played my land, and cast [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief). My opponent cast a [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and passed the turn back. I drew a [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt), attacked for 1, drew a [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), cast it, and passed the turn. My opponent played his third land and cast a kicked [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir). I sacrificed my [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), he attacked for 2, and I fell to 16. I cast Lightning bolt on the Gatekeeper on my opponent's end step.

I drew [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail), attacked with [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, and passed the turn. My opponent attacked for another 2 damage and attempted to cast another kicked Gatekeeper, but I cast [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and he passed the turn. I drew [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), cast [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) dealing 2 to my opponent and 1 to the [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), then attacked for 2 and drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). I played it and passed the turn. My opponent cast an [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), and I cast [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) targeting him in response. He took the [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt), played a land, returned the [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), and passed the turn. I drew a [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), attacked for 2, drew [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), and passed the turn. My opponent cast another [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), attacked for 2, and passed the turn.

**Sideboarding:** -4 [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend), +2 [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), +2 [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab145_hexmage.jpg)I kept 2 [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail), [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). My opponent played a [Vampire Lacerator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator) and passed the turn. I drew a [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), played my [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and passed. I let my opponent take 1 from his [Vampire Lacerator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator) and then cast [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) to kill it. My opponent played a second land, cast [Vampire Hexmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage), and passed the turn. I drew a [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), paid 2 life to cast it, and saw [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats), [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage), and [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn). I drew [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and decided to keep two mana open to counter the [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage). My opponent attacked for 2 and attempted to cast [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage), but I cast [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) as planned. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, cast [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), and passed the turn.

I knew my [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) would achieve a very juicy two-for-one if I let my opponent cast that [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) the next turn. My opponent cast [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn), played his land, attacked me down to 14, and passed the turn. I drew a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and cast [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) killing both Vampires. My opponent paid two mana for the Highborn's triggers and drained me for 4 life, putting me at 10. I attacked my opponent down to 21 and drew another [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando). My opponent attempted to cast a [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir) with kicker, but I had the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). I drew a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), attacked my opponent down to 19, cast another [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), and passed the turn. My opponent activated his [Lavaclaw Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches) and attacked me, but I cast [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to quickly end those shenanigans. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), attacked my opponent down to 15, drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and another [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), played my land, and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Vampire Lacerator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator) and passed. I cast [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) to dispatch the Vampire on his end step. On my upkeep, I rebounded the [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) to put him at 13. I drew a [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), attacked my opponent down to nine, drew a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and a [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), cast [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), saw a hand of land, and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and attacked for 2; I took the damage. I cast a [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) targeting his face on his end step, rebounded it, attacked, and cast [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to end the game.

My opponent cast an [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) off a [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores) and took my [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). I cast [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), didn't find a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), put both cards on the bottom, and drew the [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) I was looking for. My opponent cast a [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and searched his library for a [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). I drew another [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), played my land, and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and passed the turn with a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and a [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores) up. I drew [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt), cast [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), and passed the turn, and my opponent used [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)'s activated ability to drop the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) down on my end step. He attacked with the Germ token for 5 damage and went to 24, then cast a [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and passed the turn. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, and passed the turn. My opponent attacked me for 4 and went to 28, then passed the turn with five mana open. I cast [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) targeting my opponent's [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) on his end step, and he redirected it to his [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). On the rebound I again targeted the [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) with my [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), and it hit the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) again. I drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), played it, cast another [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) to finish off the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), cast a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to deal with [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), and passed the turn. My opponent attacked for another 4 lifelinking damage, cast [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), looked at my top card, left it there, and passed the turn. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, cast [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), and passed the turn. I couldn't see a way out from under the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) and I conceded after my opponent [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed with Jace and cast a pair of [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)s the next turn.

**Sideboarding:** -4 [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend), -2 [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt), +3 [Crush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush), +1 [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal), +2 [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab145_skite.jpg)I mulliganed and kept [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Crush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush), [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief). I played my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), kept an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) on top, drew the [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Despise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise) and took my [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief). I drew the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), played my land, and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and passed the turn. I drew a [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), cast it for 2 life, and saw a hand with 2 [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats), [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), and [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace). I thought about scooping on the spot, but figured I'd play the game out. I drew a [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) off the Probe, then played my land and passed the turn.

My opponent played a land and cast [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)—which I was forced to allow because I knew he had the [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce)—and fetched up his [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). He cast an [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) and took my [Crush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush). I draw an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock)ed the [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), and passed the turn. My opponent played [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), cast [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and passed the turn. I shot the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) with the rebound, then drew a [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) and finished off the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) before passing back. My opponent played a [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats), cracked it, cast [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), and passed the turn. I drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), played it, and passed. My opponent cast a [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace), equipped it to the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) Germ token, and attacked with the 6/6 vigilance lifelink protection from red monster. I conceded.

Rareless and Careless still has what it takes to compete in the current Standard environment. Yes, the deck has issues with [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), but the same can be said for every non-combo deck in the format. If you're looking to start playing Constructed with cards you probably already have (that are easy to get if you don't), then this is the perfect deck for you!
