Katsuhiro Mori is your Grand Prix–Yokohama 2010 champion! Navigating an field of 1122 players and nearly as many different archetypes, Katsuhiro Mori had armed himself with Thopter/Depths. He broke through to Day 2 with just a single loss to his name, and cruised to the Top 8. The Top 8 was a microcosm of the variety of decks in attendance. Hypergenesis, Scapeshift, All-In Red, Doran and Zoo were all present. In the finals, Mori matched up against Masashiro Kuroda and his Hypergenesis deck. It was a close-fought match, but Mori seemed to be always one step ahead, and took the title in two straight games. Congratulations to Katsuhiro Mori, Grand Prix–Yokohama champion!
