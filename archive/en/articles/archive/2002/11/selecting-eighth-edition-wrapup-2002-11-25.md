Well, it's time to wrap up our "[Selecting *Eighth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home)" promo. R&D is putting the finishing touches on the set, the editing department is giving it a good scrubbing, and all the flavor text and art choices made by those of you that participated in our polls are being dropped into place.


So let's go over everything that has happened over the past too-many months.


### Individual Card Votes


The main draw of the promotion was the ability to select which one of a pair (or sometimes more) of cards would go into *Eighth Edition*, and which would be left on the sidelines. These were decisions that R&D was debating making themselves, but realized it would be more interesting to let the players decide instead. The winners:


* **[Two-Headed Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Dragon)** defeated [Crimson Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Hellkite)
* **[Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal)** defeated [Dark Hatchling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Hatchling)
* **[Rewind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind)** defeated [Dismiss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismiss)
* **[Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge)** defeated [Static Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Static+Orb)
* **[Noble Purpose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Purpose)** defeated [Orim's Prayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Prayer)
* **[Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise)** and **[Vine Trellis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Trellis)** defeated [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Utopia Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Tree)
* **[Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship)** defeated [Pariah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah) and [Kismet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kismet)
* **[Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate)** defeated [Jokulhaups](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jokulhaups)
* **[Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon)** defeated [Dwarven Miner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Miner)
* **[Natural Affinity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Affinity)** defeated [Nature's Revolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Revolt)
* **[Yavimaya Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Enchantress)** defeated [Rabid Wombat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Wombat)
* **[Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem)** defeated [Crusade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusade)

Some of the votes were exciting and close, others were blowouts, and others were met with a level of chagrin from the players. (Many people lamented the Birds vs. Elves vote, but it perfectly illustrates the difficult decisions R&D makes every day.) And some of the results surprised even us--we all thought [Crusade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusade) was a shoo-in!


### Individual Art Votes


Running concurrently with the card votes were twelve votes that let players choose which of two illustrations would be used on some of the cards in the set. The winners:


* **Thorn Elemental: *[thorn elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=thorn%2Belemental)*** defeated *[Thorn Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Thorn%2BElemental)*
* **Angel of Mercy: *[angel of mercy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=angel%2Bof%2Bmercy)*** defeated *[Angel of Mercy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Angel%2Bof%2BMercy)*
* **Gravedigger: *[gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=gravedigger)*** defeated *[gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=gravedigger)*
* **Telepathy: *[telepathy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=telepathy)*** defeated *[Telepathy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Telepathy)*
* **Eastern Paladin: *[eastern paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=eastern%2Bpaladin)*** defeated *[Eastern Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Eastern%2BPaladin)*; and
* **Western Paladin: *[western paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=western%2Bpaladin)*** defeated *[Western Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Western%2BPaladin)*
* **Spined Wurm: *[spined wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=spined%2Bwurm)*** defeated *[Spined Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Spined%2BWurm)*
* **Goblin Chariot: *[Goblin Chariot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Goblin%2BChariot)*** defeated *[goblin chariot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=goblin%2Bchariot)*
* **Steal Artifact: *[Steal Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Steal%2BArtifact)*** defeated *[steal artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=steal%2Bartifact)*
* **Phyrexian Colossus: *[Phyrexian Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Phyrexian%2BColossus)*** defeated *[phyrexian colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=phyrexian%2Bcolossus)*
* **Shatter: *[shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=shatter)*** defeated *[shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=shatter)* and *[Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Shatter)*
* **Trained Armodon: *[trained armodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=trained%2Barmodon)*** defeated *[Trained Armodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Trained%2BArmodon)*
* **Boil: *[boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=boil)*** defeated *[Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Boil)*

In most cases, players preferred the original card art to the reprint art, but in some instances (most notably [Phyrexian Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Colossus)), the newer art won.


### Flavor Text Submissions/Votes


The next phase was flavor text. We accepted fan-submitted text for six cards (two of which had to be real-world material), and then our creative department pulled out the best submissions and put them to a popular vote. The vote winners will appear on the cards in *Eighth Edition*.


### Aladdin's Ring




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Flavor Text Submission** | **Submitted By** | **Voting**  | **Results** |
| A good lamp will light your way. A good ring will clear it. --attributed to Aladdin's jeweler. | Pale Mage | 1395 | 18.24% |
| In his hand lay the ring. And in the ring, lay Death. | Rolias Noom | 1222 | 15.98% |
| When it was time to divide the spoils from the dungeon, they foolishly laughed at the young mage for choosing a humble ring. | Fred Cole | 1045 | 13.66% |
| Who needs the other two wishes when I have this? | Zaphkiel | 1011 | 13.22% |
| Crafted from desert sand/ Carved with desert wind/ Carrying a desert's death | John Johansen | 871 | 11.39% |
| With power comes responsibility… Aladdin never was that responsible. | Andy Weisenfeld | 652 | 8.53% |
| Aside from the smell of charred flesh, Aladdin rather liked his new ring. | Marissa | 581 | 7.60% |
| With this ring I thee slay... | John Moxley | 329 | 4.30% |
| It took the wizard years to obtain the famed treasure, but only seconds to reduce his enemies to sad remains. | Jens Mueller | 287 | 3.75% |
| It grants all wishes of pain. | Eric Anderson | 255 | 3.33% |
| **Totals:** |  | **7648** | **100.00%** |

After going through editing, here is the quote as it will appear on the card:



> 
> *"A good lamp will light your way. A good ring will clear it.”  
> 
> —Nervan, royal jeweler* 
> 
> 
> 


Nervan is the name of the jeweler that sold Aladdin the ring in *1001 Arabian Nights*. Ok, no it wasnt. We made it up.


### Orcish Artillery




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Flavor Text Submission** | **Submitted By** | **Voting**  | **Results** |
| So, they want to kill my men. Well, Two can play that game. --Orcish General | William Reed | 2253 | 33.63% |
| Glok felt one glorious moment of pride just before he smashed the gate open with his face. | [Anonymous] | 790 | 11.79% |
| To the orcs, stealth technology simply meant placing a gag over the mouth of the ammunition. | David Elkind | 722 | 10.78% |
| The second most common cause of Orc death. Natural causes comes in 34th. | Toby Wachter | 590 | 8.81% |
| This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me... or was it the other way around? | Brian Fayce | 496 | 7.40% |
| Now accepting donations of ammunition. Pots, pans, broken yard tools, naughty children, anything will do! --Orcish Council of War | [Anonymous] | 419 | 6.25% |
| The artillery was an excellent device for judging distances by how long the ammunition screamed. | Wayne Mittlestead | 417 | 6.22% |
| Fly like an eagle, fall like a rock. | Antti Salmi | 417 | 6.22% |
| Further research confirms that the thin one not only are easier to tie and load up, but also go higher and farther. --Orcish Research Center (ORC) | Amanda | 348 | 5.19% |
| All of a sudden, the pieces--the all-rock diet, the "flying lessons"--fell together for Korgex. He screamed. | Robert Butts | 248 | 3.70% |
| **Totals:** |  | **6700** | **100.00%** |

Editing cleaned the quote up as such:



> 
> *“So they want to kill my men? Well two can play at that game.”  
> 
> —General Khurzog*
> 
> 
> 


That's great stuff. General Khurzog was an Orc general from *Fallen Empires* flavor text, resurrected for duty on this card.


### Persecute




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Flavor Text Submission** | **Submitted By** | **Voting**  | **Results** |
| Of all the tyrannies on human kind / The worst is that which persecutes the mind. --John Dryden, “The Hind and the Panther” | Rob Myers | 1562 | 24.08% |
| “Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.” --William Shakespeare, Measure for Measure | Kelly Reid | 1173 | 18.09% |
| “What is their hatred but a proof that I am speaking the truth? Hence has arisen the prejudice against me.” --Plato, Apology | Scott A. (GoatLord) | 1112 | 17.14% |
| “‘I’ll be the judge, I’ll be the jury,’ said cunning old Fury, ‘I’ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’” --Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland | Timothy Coates | 1002 | 15.45% |
| “What other dungeon is so dark as one’s own heart? What other jailer so inexorable as one’s self?” --Nathaniel Hawthorne, The House of Seven Gables | Tiabeth | 954 | 14.71% |
| “Is it decreed that one half of the flock should be the persecutor of the other?” --Marquis de Sade | Mary Van Tyne | 443 | 6.83% |
| “At once as far as Angels kenn he views / The dismal Situation waste and wild, / A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round” --John Milton, Paradise Lost | Don Lee | 240 | 3.70% |
| **Totals:** |  | **6486** | **100.00%** |

After finding a physical copy of the original source material, editing will be putting this version on the card:



> 
> *“Of all the tyrannies on humane kind / The worst is that which persecutes the mind.”  
> 
> —John Dryden, “The Hind and the Panther”*
> 
> 
> 


Note that some of the original archaic spelling has been restored. For those interested, John Dryden was an English critic, playwright, and poet laureate that lived in the late 1600s, and was the most celebrated literary figure of the Restoration.


### Verduran Enchantress




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Flavor Text Submission** | **Submitted By** | **Voting**  | **Results** |

| The wind sings her name, while her foes scream it. | maverick2006 | 515 | 8.27% |
| She will show you many things, but few are within your reach. | Matt Robinson | 459 | 7.37% |
| To one in tune with magic, wizards are not a threat, but rather a vein of power waiting to be tapped. --Siren, Verduran mystic | Drew Johnston | 442 | 7.10% |
| She could tell you how everything came to be. She could undo everything as well, if only she had a reason. | Matt Bettine | 238 | 3.82% |
| A whip made of silk can still do harm. | Llanowar\_Necromancer | 233 | 3.74% |
| Her innocence is an illusion. If she had her way, the world would be overrun with all manner of pernicious flora -- to the eventual extinction of humankind. | Neil Melville | 212 | 3.41% |
| **Totals:** |  | **6224** | **100.00%** |

The quote as it will appear on the card:



> 
> *“Graceful? Yes. Beautiful? Absolutely. Harmless? Definitely not.”  
> 
> —Fyndhorn elder*
> 
> 
> 


The attribution to "Fyndhorn elder" was done by the editing department before the vote began.


### Confiscate




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Flavor Text Submission** | **Submitted By** | **Voting**  | **Results** |
| It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected. --Mark Twain | Zach Efland | 2234 | 40.56% |

| Amongst so many borrowed things, I am glad if I can steal one, disguising and altering it for some new service. --Michel de Montaigne, "Of Physiognomy" | John Carter | 423 | 7.68% |
| Is it not a saying in everyone's mouth, Possession is half of the law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession is the whole of the law. --Herman Melville, Moby Dick | David Welsh | 415 | 7.53% |
| An object in possession seldom retains the same charm that it had in pursuit. --Pliny the Younger, Letters | Jean-Louis Despres | 345 | 6.26% |
| All that spirits desire, spirits attain. --Kahlil Gibran, "The Poet of Baalbek" | Adam Augusta | 262 | 4.76% |
| Poverty wants some things, luxury many, avarice all. --Abraham Cowley, "Of Avarice" | David Warner | 259 | 4.70% |

| **Totals:** |  | **5508** | **100.00%** |

As a fan of real-world flavor text, I must say I am tickled with this quote.



> 
> *“It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.”  
> 
> —Mark Twain,* More Maxims of Mark
> 
> 
> 


For the handful that don't know, Mark Twain (penname of Samuel Longhorne Clemens) was one of the great American authors of the nineteenth century. His most popular works include *Tom Sawyer* and The *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*.


### Serra Angel

| Her beauty equals her strength. Her strength equals her will. Her will is limitless. | Louis Doan | 747 | 11.30% |

### Land Art Votes


Last week we put up the final piece of the *Eighth Edition* puzzle, the options for basic land art. And now that the votes are final, I'm sure John Avon is very proud. With 12 out of a possible 18 lands of his receiving enough votes to be included in the set (he only had two Plains up for consideration), it is clear that Avon is the most popular land artist ever. No other individual artist had more than one land voted into *Eighth Edition*.


The winning selections:




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plains |
| Plains thumbnail*Seventh Edition*
 John Avon | Plains thumbnail*Onslaught*
 Matthew Mitchell | Plains thumbnail*Invasion*

The numeric vote tallies follow. Remember that each voter chose four of each land; if one piece got 6% of the total votes, that means 24% of the voters chose it.
