White-Green Collected Company, because it is good against Esper, Abzan, and Red Aggro.

I may have gone a little crazy with the Windstorms.

**Age:** 25




**Occupation:** Hardware Engineer at NVidia





**Hometown:** Born in Philadelphia, now living in Santa Clara, CA





**Previous Magic accomplishments:**



Two Pro Tour Day 2’s, many close calls at Grand Prix.





**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**



Bant. I brought it to the RPTQ and it was the best choice. The metagame shifted a bit in the past week (Ashioks, Perilous Vaults) but I didn’t have time to worry about swapping.





**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



Might consider [Ajani Steadfast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Steadfast) over Surrak. Neal Oliver, Ben Weitz and Eric Severson had solid success with that choice.





**What is the most important card in your deck?**



I feel that [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) is the glue that holds the deck together. Value, getting back key cards, recurring Deathmist Raptor, and sometimes being a sneaky attacker.





**What summer movie are you most looking forward to?**



Jurassic World? Shoutouts to Deathmist Raptor!

**Age:** 25 as of yesterday!




**Occupation:** Graduate Student




**Hometown:** St. Paul, MN





**Previous Magic accomplishments:**



GP Portland finalist. PT Khans of Tarkir 35th. GP Oakland 13th. Started a podcast called “Allied Strategies” with Neal Oliver & Tristan Killeen.




**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**



Bant Megamorph with Ajani Steadfast. It has a good matchup against Esper and Mono-Red, which I expected to be very popular. It also just does very powerful things very efficiently. Ajani has been fantastic all weekend. It’s great in your worst matchups, only dead against Esper. Even there you might be able to combo it with Ojutai.




**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



The maindeck was fantastic! The sideboard was mostly good, but the [Hidden Dragonslayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Dragonslayer) was pretty mediocre. I did board it in a lot, though, so who knows? Elspeth overperformed, so maybe a second copy.




**What is the most important card in your deck?**



Den Protector. Very grindy, card advantage, and the evasion should never be underestimated. Ajani and Dromoka’s Command both make it bigger.




**What summer movie are you most looking forward to?**



Avengers: Age of Ultron

**Age:** 20




**Occupation:** Student




**Hometown:** Waterloo, Ontario


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**



Top 8 at Grand Prix Toronto 2013





**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**



Mardu Dragons, because Daniel Ward is a master.





**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



-1 Seeker of the Way, +1 Soulfire Grand Master, which overperformed.





**What is the most important card in your deck?**



Crackling Doom, because it is OP






**What summer movie are you most looking forward to?**



Pitch Perfect 2

**Age:** 24




**Occupation:** Advertising Operations




**Hometown:** Somerville, MA





**Previous Magic accomplishments:**



None at the Grand Prix level or above. This qualifies me for my first Pro Tour!





**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**



Abzan Morphs. Worked with Jarvis Yu, Lukas Caulson and Andrew Tenjum on the list and felt good about all my non-devotion matchups.





**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



Could take or leave Deathmist Raptor. Elspeth and [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) are interchangeable between maindeck and sideboard depending on the field. A fourth [Llanowar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar) Wastes might be good.




**What is the most important card in your deck?**



[Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) (Bae)





**What summer movie are you most looking forward to?**



Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

**Age:** 23




**Occupation:** Supreme Overlord at Face-to-Face Games Toronto

Grand Prix Montreal 2014 Top 4. Canadian National Team 2014





**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**



Abzan Control. Every matchup is reasonable, and the sideboard is fantastic.





**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



I wish I was playing a maindeck Nissa, Worldwaker. That card wins plane tickets.





**What is the most important card in your deck?**



Den Protector. So much advantage on a surprisingly relevant body.





**What summer movie are you most looking forward to?**



Summer of a Movie!

Is the new Twilight out this summer?
