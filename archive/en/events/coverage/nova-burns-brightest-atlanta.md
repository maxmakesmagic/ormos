Heading into Sunday's competition, the buzz was that the alliance between Rood, Yellowhat and The Original Juggernaut was the team to beat. The competition facing David Rood, Gabriel Nassif and Gab Tsang was stiff, though.


First they'd face One Spin, powered at a distance by the tutelage of genius Itaru Ishida. Then they'd have to face the winner of a match between the team with match points to spare and the Last Chance Qualifier team hungry to take down first prize.


The confidence of the LCQ American team We Add was supreme in this latter match. Old-schooler Andrew Pacifico, together with the deadly quiet Adam Chambers and the eager Don Smith, came out of their draft with the French shaking their heads. The matches were quick and brutal. The loss of Les Baltringues de Ludipia to We Add stung all the worse for the fact that the French had intentionally drawn to put We Add in the fourth seed, expecting easy competition Sunday.


On the other side of the bracket, the upcoming Japanese squad One Spin had their work cut out for them against Nova. Coming out of the draft it looked like they were facing an uphill battle, but at least the match between Gab Tsang and Tomohiro Kaji looked like it would fall their way. And it did, but only seconds before Nassif won his second game. Since Rood had dispatched Kenji Tsumura, Nova moved one step closer to a title.


In the final draft, Nova again showed their wealth of experience and talent. It wasn't long before they needed to win only one game out of three to secure the championship. That honor fell to Nassif, whose green monsters marched over Chambers to the cheers of the crowd watching the big screen.


Most pros expressed no surprise at Nova's victory. Between the rock-solid reputations of the two Gabs and the ample team experience of Rood, they had everything working in their favor. In fact, both Rood and Nassif have been part of quarterfinalist teams who met their doom at the hands of Phoenix Foundation.


With that particular wrecking ball sidelined by an absent Marco Blume and a laid-back Dirk Baberowski, the way was cleared for Nova to step on the competition and earn Nassif, the reigning Player of the Year, his first Pro Tour title after three career second-place finishes.


Congratulations to Nova, Pro Tour-Atlanta Champions!
