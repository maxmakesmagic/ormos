The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 2, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [possibilities](https://i.redd.it/iothvaixzepz.jpg).


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Top Stories of Grand Prix Providence](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppro17/top-stories-2017-10-01) | Wizards of the Coast | Corbin Hosler

So, the main story of this one is probably Martin Jůza (alongside Andrew Baeckstrom and Corey Burkhart) winning *another* Grand Prix to stay in 3rd place for Grand Prix Top 8 (Team Top 4) all-time, but many—wait, Peach Garden Oath (William Jensen, Reid Duke, and Owen Turtenwald) made the finals again? Is it even fair at this point?


1. StarCityGames.com Dallas Open | [twitch.tv/scgtour](https://www.twitch.tv/scgtour/videos/all)

Hostages were taken, Sultai Energy emerged (see [the deck of the day](#10)), and Andrew Jessup grabbed another Open Series trophy. Check out [SCG's Twitch video archives](https://www.twitch.tv/scgtour/videos/all) to relive the weekend. Just make sure you set aside like 20 hours.


Of course, you probably just want decklists. You would. [Here, go nuts](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=1&start_date=09/29/2017&end_date=10/01/2017&start=1&finish=64&event_ID=19&city=Dallas&limit=100).


1. [Top Stories Grand Prix Shizuoka (Autumn)](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpshi17-2/top-stories-grand-prix-shizuoka-autumn-2017-2017-10-01) | Wizards of the Coast | Chapmin Sim

If you're confused by the (Autumn) moniker above, it's because we've doubled up on Grand Prix Shizuokas this year, and champions Michio Abe, Syo Hayakawa, and Kentarou Tachibana were sure glad we did, strutting away with the trophy after besting a Top 4 filled with World Championship competitors. I would tell you more, but then what's the point of providing the link?


1. [The *Magic* Art of David Palumbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgBEzYWSiA&feature=youtu.be) | TheMagicManSam

In which I continue sharing every MagicManSam video I find.

1. [My Complete *Ixalan* Set Review for Constructed](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/my-complete-ixalan-set-review-for-constructed/) | ChannelFireball | Joel Larsson

Want an entire set review in one place? Want to stare longingly at Larsson's handsome mug? Now you can do both in one article! This one!


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Admiring Admiral Beckett Brass and the Crew](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35929_Admiring-Admiral-Beckett-Brass-And-The-Crew.html) | StarCityGames.com | Bennie Smith

Yes, yes, there are enough Pirates in *Magic* for an [Admiral Beckett Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Admiral+Beckett+Brass) Commander deck. Bennie marks X on those that make the cut.


1. [Project Updates: *Ixalan* Edition](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/abesargent-10022017-project-updates-ixalan-edition/) | Gathering Magic | Abe Sargent

The article gets to say, over and over again, "Abe's Deck of Happiness and Joy," so there's that. There's also *Ixalan* changes to his Commander Cube, Commander decks, and other, well, happy and joyful decks.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

Frank wasn't the only one calling for this clip to make Corbin's article (it did). Osyp has a history of entertaining moments like these—and the bluff isn't what you're here for. It's the celebration. Over 1 point of damage.


Well played, Osyp. Well played.

Speaking of well-played, this was a whole thing throughout the course of last week. There was a rumor going around of a Legacy Pirates deck people were calling Pirate Stompy or Legacy Stompy. Multiple forum posts were made about it, it was discussed widely on social media, SaffronOlive tried to piece it together—it even led to [a discussion about "deck rights,"](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/10/pirate-stompy-controversy/) as in the right to hide your decklist from people. Like I said, it was a whole thing.


That turned out not to be a thing at all. Turns out it was a lark that just kept going—kept going to the point that multiple people actually found some success with what people were saying the deck was. So maybe Popeye Stompy really did exist—in our hearts, the whole time.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Andrew Jessup's Sultai Energy](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=116335)

We've seen Temur Energy. We've seen Red-Green Energy. We've seen Four-Color Energy. We've seen Black-Green Energy. But this is the first sighting of success with Sultai Energy. So why now?


Two cards are primarily responsible for the Sultainaissance—[The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) and [Hostage Taker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostage+Taker).


[The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) is the new hotness, as far as finishers are concerned. It's difficult to kill, runs away with games after just a turn or two, and even has a little built-in graveyard hate against decks like [God-Pharaoh's Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift). It slices, it dices, it comes back for more.


[Hostage Taker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostage+Taker), however, is the new kid on the block from *Ixalan*, and it offers a fantastic removal spell and [Control Magic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic) in one. It's kind of like a [Gonti, Lord of Luxury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gonti%2C+Lord+of+Luxury) that affects the board. Jessup went to the full four on his way to winning the SCG Open this past weekend, and it looked good on camera all weekend.


And if you've ever used [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) to reanimate a [Hostage Taker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostage+Taker), then you, my friend, have lived.


The rest of the deck is essentially the Black-Green Energy deck that relies on [Winding Constrictor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor) for being awesome. It upgraded its sideboard significantly, with [Deathgorge Scavenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgorge+Scavenger), [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), [Vraska's Contempt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%27s+Contempt), [Vraska, Relic Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%2C+Relic+Seeker), and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) all debuting from *Ixalan*.


Now the question is, will hostages be taken at the *Magic* World Championship this weekend in Boston?
