 While only a few European players made the trip here this weekend, one group of Swedes did. Ramquist made the trip together with Susanne Bornelöv and a few other friends from Uppsala, and three of them are still playing on Day Two.




 Ramquist made Top 8 at Grand Prix Warsaw earlier this year, proving his standard prowess. He's also piloted the Blue devotion deck he's running this weekend to the Top 4 of a 200-player standard championship in Sweden two weeks ago.




 His opponent, Vladimir Lesnik, proved his knowledge of the format by winning a Grand Prix Trial on Friday night. He's running the same Jund Monsters list in the actual Grand Prix, which has a little twist to it featuring two copies of [Reaper of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds).  




**The Games**




 Unfortunately for the Swede, his advantage in the first game was diminished by being forced to mulligan to five cards, seeing no lands in his first two tries. He finally settled for a hand of Island, Island, Island, [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor), hoping that his first few draw steps would fuel up his Island fed forces. "Mulligans are unfortunate, but that's **Magic**, " he calmly commented his mulligans.




 Lesnik started out things with a tapped [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground). Followed by [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and a [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Niklas summoned his [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor), but with no play on turn two he was unable to evolve it, and it looked lonely, watching Lesnik's creatures from above. Lesnik attacked with his Ooze and [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), dropping Ramquist to 16. A good route for the Jund deck when it is unable to find its crucial mana accelerators [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) or [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid).




 On his third turn Ramquist revealed why he had kept playing Islands, rather than the [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) in his opener, when he summoned Nightveil Spectre, making his Raptor a 1/2, attacked Lesnik to 19 and crossed his fingers as hard as he could for his Spectre to live.  



Lesnik couldn't find a fifth land for the two copies of [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) in his had, but had a good alternative in [Reaper of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds), while attacking with just his [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), Ramquist now at 10.
