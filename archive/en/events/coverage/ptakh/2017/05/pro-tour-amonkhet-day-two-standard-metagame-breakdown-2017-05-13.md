378 players entered the tournament on Friday, but only 239 of them (63%) reached the requisite record of 4-4 to qualify for the second day. Theoretically, someone could have gone 1-4 in Standard and stayed alive on the back off of a 3-0 Draft record, while another player might have been 3-2 in Standard and eliminated due to an 0-3 draft. Nevertheless, there is an obvious correlation between a good Standard deck and making Day Two.


[Yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptakh/pro-tour-amonkhet-day-one-standard-metagame-breakdown-2017-05-12), the three most popular archetypes were Mardu Vehicles, [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel), and Zombies. Today, I'll go over every single archetype to explain their game plans, describe their variations, and analyze their performances!


The key measure of performance we will consider is the Day Two conversion rate. This statistic describes the percentage of players who made Day Two with a certain type of deck. So if eight out of ten pilots make Day Two, that's an 80% conversion, which is well above the global average of 63%. But if only five out of ten pilots made Day Two, then that would entail a 50% conversion, indicating a poor performance.


AETHERWORKS MARVEL
==================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Woodweaver%27s+Puzzleknot)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodweaver%27s+Puzzleknot) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aetherworks+Marvel)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)
[Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) was in second place yesterday, but it has overtaken Mardu Vehicles as the most popular archetype on Day Two.


The ban of [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) opened up the space for [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) to return. It used to be better to assemble the two-card infinite combo with [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) on turn four rather than spinning the wheel with [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel), but nowadays a turn-four Ulamog is arguably the most busted thing you can do in Standard.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aetherworks Marvel Variant | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| Stock Temur Aetherworks | 49 | 34 | 69% |
| Spell-Heavy Temur Aetherworks | 14 | 12 | 86% |
| Flamecaller Temur Aetherworks | 7 | 7 | 100% |
| Sultai Aetherworks | 15 | 10 | 67% |
| Bant Aetherworks | 5 | 3 | 60% |
| Four-Color Aetherworks | 6 | 2 | 33% |
| **Total** | **96** | **68** | **71%** |

The most popular shell was what I labeled as "Stock Temur Aetherworks." This deck looks remarkably similar to the old Four-Color Saheeli decks, except with [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) and [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) instead of [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) and [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) (and with [Woodweaver's Puzzleknot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodweaver%27s+Puzzleknot) replacing [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa)). Between [Rogue Refiner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Refiner) and [Whirler Virtuoso](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirler+Virtuoso), it's easy to assemble six energy for [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel), and anyone who has played against Four-Color Saheeli will know that the creature midrange plan is a viable path to victory as well.


Within this group of Stock Temur Aetherworks variants, there were some differences in the flex slots. Most commonly seen were [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance); [Magma Spray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray); and [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), but there were also versions that relied more heavily on [Bounty of the Luxa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bounty+of+the+Luxa) or [Nissa's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Revelation). These ramp cards could help cast any [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)s that were drawn. Several versions with these ramp cards included [Pull from Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pull+from+Tomorrow) as a mana sink as well. Other common choices for the flex slots were sweepers ([Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return) or [Sweltering Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sweltering+Suns)) to gain an edge against Zombies, and big monsters ([Bristling Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bristling+Hydra) and [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer)), which are good by themselves and can help diversify the threat base against [Dispossess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispossess) and [Lost Legacy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+Legacy) in post-sideboarded games.


The second-most popular Temur version was a spell-heavy variant that generally featured [Censor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censor), [Glimmer of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmer+of+Genius), and sometimes even [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk). To make room for these cards, these lists cut [Servant of the Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+the+Conduit). The third-most popular Temur version was one that included three to four copies of [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) in the main deck. The planeswalker helps sweep the board against Zombies, can discard Ulamogs for fresh cards, and is a decent hit for [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel). On the back of these card choices (as well as high skilled pilots), these Temur versions posted an impressive conversion rate that was substantially higher than the (already high) conversion rate of Stock Temur Aetherworks.


Sultai Aetherworks traded in the red energy cards for [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push) and Liliana, Death's Mastery. This deck had "Zombie Ulamog" as a backup plan: the deck could mill Ulamog with [Vessel of Nascency](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vessel+of+Nascency) and then reanimate it with [Liliana, Death's Majesty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+Death%27s+Majesty). You don't get the cast trigger, but you still get a 10/10 indestructible monster. Most of these lists featured [Ishkanah, Grafwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ishkanah%2C+Grafwidow) and [Demon of Dark Schemes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon+of+Dark+Schemes) as well. I also included two Temur lists with [Vessel of Nascency](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vessel+of+Nascency) and [Ishkanah, Grafwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ishkanah%2C+Grafwidow) in the Sultai group because, despite technically being the wrong colors, they all had Vessel and Ishkanah in common.


Bant Aetherworks the least popular three-color combination. It's essentially a blue-white control deck splashing for green energy cards that is capable of Marveling out a [Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate) at instant speed.


Finally, Four-Color Aetherworks includes the best of all worlds, either splashing red for [Harnessed Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harnessed+Lightning) or splashing white for Nahiri the Harbinger. These decks did not fare well.


MARDU VEHICLES
==============


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Heart+of+Kiran)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Unlicensed+Disintegration)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar)
Mardu Vehicles has been a Standard mainstay since the release of *Kaladesh*, but it was the deck everyone expected to see and was prepared to beat. Correspondingly, its conversion rate was below average.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mardu Vehicles Variant | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| Stock midrange build | 87 | 49 | 56% |
| Version with blue in the sideboard | 6 | 5 | 83% |
| Version with Inventor's Apprentice | 5 | 3 | 60% |
| Version with Depala/Fleetwheel | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| **Total** | **99** | **57** | **58%** |

The most common (midrange) build of Mardu Vehicles typically featured eight one-drops, 25 lands, eight removal spells, and a curve that topped out with several five-drops—most commonly [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn), but sometimes [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer). Usually, this build would feature a transformational sideboard into a Mardu Planeswalkers deck, complete with Oaths, sweepers, and removal spells.


There was no consensus on two-drops. Some lists had [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista) (to increase the artifact count), others had [Veteran Motorist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Motorist) (for a more aggressive stance); some had a mix, and a few opted for newcomer [Glory-Bound Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory-Bound+Initiate). Arguably, [Veteran Motorist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Motorist) is the best fit for the deck, especially now that [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista) is no longer needed to stop the Copy Cat combo, but it's not an artifact (necessitating the inclusion of [Pia Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pia+Nalaar) or [Cultivator's Caravan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivator%27s+Caravan) to increase the artifact count) and it requires a lot of red mana sources (which left fewer black sources for the aftermath on [Cut // Ribbons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cut+%2F%2F+Ribbons)).


The versions with blue had [Spirebluff Canal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirebluff+Canal) in the main deck to support [Metallic Rebuke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Rebuke), [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), and/or [Ceremonious Rejection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ceremonious+Rejection) in the sideboard. These versions had the highest conversion rate among all Mardu variants.


The versions with [Inventor's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventor%27s+Apprentice) usually had eleven one-drops, 23 lands, six removal spells, and a curve that tops out at four. These lists looked eerily similar to the deck that won the last Pro Tour. Indeed, Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Champion Lukas Esper Berthoud sleeved up his [Inventor's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventor%27s+Apprentice) again, in the hope of beating [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel)s and [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk)s before the opponent had a chance to set up. He was not successful in making Day Two, but most other [Inventor's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventor%27s+Apprentice) aficionados did.


Finally, there was a lone version with 4 [Depala, Pilot Exemplar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Depala%2C+Pilot+Exemplar) and 4 [Fleetwheel Cruiser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleetwheel+Cruiser) that did not make Day Two.


ZOMBIES
=======


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dread+Wanderer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lord+of+the+Accursed)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Accursed)
Many players expected to see some number of Zombie decks at Pro Tour *Amonkhet*, but the sheer amount that showed up was somewhat of a surprise. They posted a very strong conversion rate as well, just about as high as [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel).


The reason for the Zombie outbreak was that the tribe got a lot of support from *Amonkhet*. [Dread Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer) in particular is a great one-drop to attack early and to grind late, and the deck as a whole can now quickly generate a critical mass of Zombies.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zombies Variant | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| Mono-Black Zombies | 63 | 46 | 73% |
| White-Black Zombies | 15 | 10 | 67% |
| **Total** | **78** | **56** | **72%** |

Most of the mono-black variants looked alike. Many versions had as many as twelve "lords": [Metallic Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Mimic), [Lord of the Accursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Accursed), and [Liliana's Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Mastery). In this regard, it looked similar to Merfolk decks in Modern or Legacy. The deck has a strong late game as well with mana sinks and creature recursion, and it includes some of the most efficient removal spells in the format.


The white-black variants sacrificed the most consistent monocolor mana base in Standard (with [Westvale Abbey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey)) to gain access to cards like [Wayward Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayward+Servant) and [Binding Mummy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Binding+Mummy). Many lists had [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) and [Anguished Unmaking](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anguished+Unmaking) in their sideboards as well.


One weakness the deck has is to sweepers. Since the deck intends to go wide with a bunch of 2/2 Zombies tokens, cards like [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) and [Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate) are quite effective against it. Most decks, including Mardu Vehicles, had access to those sweepers in their sideboards. (About one eighth of the Mardu Vehicles players at the Pro Tour anticipated enough Zombie decks to add multiple [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) to their sideboard for that matchup.) Given this weakness, I found it interesting to see what kind of sweeper-resistant threats the Mono-Black Zombie lists would have in their sideboards. After all, even if Zombies might be favored against Mardu Vehicles in Game 1, they could be a dog in the post-sideboard games if they don't have a good sideboard against Mardu's planeswalkers and sweepers.


The most notable sweeper-resistant cards I saw were [Scrapheap Scrounger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger); [Yahenni, Undying Partisan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yahenni%2C+Undying+Partisan); and [Bontu the Glorified](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bontu+the+Glorified). Planeswalkers and Vehicles—such as [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope); [Ob Nixilis Reignited](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis+Reignited); [Aethersphere Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersphere+Harvester); or [Skysovereign, Consul Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship)—were included in multiple sideboards as well. All of these cards can develop the board while sidestepping sorcery-speed sweepers. Finally, I spotted several sideboards with [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) and [Plague Belcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Belcher), which could survive [Sweltering Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sweltering+Suns) and [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames), even if they aren't as impressive against [Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate).


BLACK-GREEN
===========


After the "Big Three" of Aetherworks, Mardu, and Zombies, we get to the less popular decks, starting with black-green variants. Most of them didn't gain that many new tools from *Amonkhet*, and as a whole black-green decks put up a below-average performance.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Black-Green Variant | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| Black-Green Energy | 10 | 6 | 60% |
| Black-Green Delirium | 5 | 3 | 60% |
| Black-Green Cryptolith Rite | 5 | 5 | 100% |
| Black-Green Constrictor | 5 | 2 | 40% |
| Sultai Delirium | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| Abzan Delirium | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| **Total** | **29** | **16** | **55%** |

Energy variants generally were built around [Attune with Aether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether), [Greenbelt Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenbelt+Rampager), and [Longtusk Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longtusk+Cub). Delirium variants typically featured [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer), [Vessel of Nascency](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vessel+of+Nascency), and [Ishkanah, Grafwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ishkanah%2C+Grafwidow). Multicolor delirium variants didn't fare well. Finally, the Constrictor variants relied on the synergy between [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor), [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista), and [Rishkar, Peema Renegade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishkar%2C+Peema+Renegade), and didn't include a large energy theme.


Perhaps the most interesting build was one with [Cryptolith Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Rite). Many of the cheap creatures from last year's Rites decks were present once again, this time flanked by [Bontu the Glorified](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bontu+the+Glorified) and [Vizier of the Menagerie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+the+Menagerie) as mana sinks. This archetype had an impressive 100% conversion rate.


TORRENTIAL GEARHULK CONTROL
===========================


There were still plenty of players who loved to [Censor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censor) your spells, put your cards back with [Commit // Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commit+%2F%2F+Memory), generate card advantage with [Pull from Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pull+from+Tomorrow), and push ahead with [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk). Yet, the group of [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) archetypes did terribly at this Pro Tour.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gearhulk Control Variant | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| Blue-Red Control | 16 | 9 | 56% |
| Blue-Red Dynavolt Tower | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| Jeskai Control | 3 | 1 | 33% |
| Temur Dynavolt Tower | 2 | 2 | 100% |
| White-Blue Control | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| **Total** | **25** | **12** | **48%** |

Blue-Red Control was the most common variant, which had gained a lot from *Amonkhet*. Besides the already-mentioned blue cards, it featured [Magma Spray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray) and [Sweltering Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sweltering+Suns) to keep the Zombie decks in check.


White versions gained access to [Cast Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cast+Out) and [Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate), but these decks didn't do well. [Dynavolt Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower) versions also performed poorly, although the ones with green did better.


WHITE-BLUE SPELL QUELLER
========================


As we learned in the aftermath of Pro Tour *Kaladesh*, counterspells are good at stopping [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel). [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) in particular lines up well against the four-mana artifact. However, if the Day One results of this Pro Tour are any indication, [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) decks are not the place to be.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spell Queller Variant | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| White-Blue Flash | 10 | 4 | 40% |
| White-Blue Spirits | 2 | 1 | 50% |
| **Total** | **12** | **5** | **42%** |

Most flash variants were reminiscent of the White-Blue Flash decks from several months ago, except now with new cards like [Censor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censor), [Cast Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cast+Out), and [Glory-Bound Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory-Bound+Initiate). Spirit decks had [Mausoleum Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Wanderer), [Rattlechains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattlechains), and/or [Nebelgast Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nebelgast+Herald).


TEMUR ENERGY
============


Temur Energy encompassed a group of midrange decks that (besides an energy package of, say, [Servant of the Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+the+Conduit), [Whirler Virtuoso](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirler+Virtuoso), [Rogue Refiner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Refiner), [Attune with Aether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether), and [Harnessed Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harnessed+Lightning)) would use the new [Channeler Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channeler+Initiate) to ramp into big threats like [Bristling Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bristling+Hydra), [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer), and so on. I made a distinction between versions with [Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend) and versions without.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Temur Energy Variant | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| Temur Deep-Fiend | 5 | 4 | 80% |
| Other Temur Energy decks | 6 | 5 | 83% |
| **Total** | **11** | **5** | **82%** |

The "other" Temur Energy lists would generally run [Verdurous Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk) and/or planeswalkers ([Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar); [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai); [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance); and so on) instead of [Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend).


Overall, these decks had a great performance, and they put a large majority of their players into Day Two.


RED AGGRO
=========


Red aggro decks came in various flavors and had an average Day One performance overall.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Red Aggro Variant | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| Jund Gods | 3 | 2 | 67% |
| Red-White Humans | 2 | 2 | 100% |
| Red-Green Energy | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| Red-Green Pummeler | 1 | 0 | 0% |
| Red-White Exert | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| **Total** | **8** | **5** | **63%** |

Jund Gods is a kind of a mix between Mardu Vehicles (with [Heart of Kiran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) and [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration)) and Black-Green Energy (with [Attune with Aether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether) and [Greenbelt Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenbelt+Rampager)), but with [Rhonas the Indomitable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhonas+the+Indomitable) and [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent) thrown in.


[Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent) was also included in Red-White Humans—a deck that took advantage of [Honored Crop-Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honored+Crop-Captain) and [Glory-Bound Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory-Bound+Initiate) from *Amonkhet*.


OTHERS
======


And to round things out, we have all decks that didn't fit into one of the previous categories.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Archetype | #Day One | #Day Two | Conversion |
| New Perspectives Combo | 7 | 3 | 43% |
| Black-Red Midrange | 5 | 2 | 40% |
| Blue-Red Emerge | 2 | 2 | 100% |
| Mardu Planeswalkers | 2 | 0 | 0% |
| Abzan Tokens | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| White-Black Control | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| White-Blue Engulf the Shore | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| Green-White Tokens | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| **Total** | **20** | **11** | **55%** |

[New Perspectives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives) Combo decks aim to cast the namesake card, then cycle [Shefet Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shefet+Monitor) and [Vizier of Tumbling Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Tumbling+Sands) to get mana, subsequently cast [Shadow of the Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+the+Grave) to do it all again, and then win by, say, casting [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) twice in the same turn. However, the deck is vulnerable to fast aggro decks and countermagic, and it didn't perform well on Day One.


Black-Red Midrange aimed for a reactive curve of [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push); [Lay Bare the Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+Bare+the+Heart); [Sweltering Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sweltering+Suns); [Gonti, Lord of Luxury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gonti%2C+Lord+of+Luxury); and [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer). The deck only put two out of its five pilots into Day Two.


Interestingly, all of the one-of "other" decks advanced to Day Two. I'll give a one-sentence summary of each.


Abzan Tokens uses [Hidden Stockpile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Stockpile) and [Anointed Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession) in tandem with token-generating cards to flood the board with, say, embalmed [Sacred Cat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Cat) tokens.


White-Black Control can start with [Gifted Aetherborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifted+Aetherborn) and [Flaying Tendrils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaying+Tendrils) and eventually win with [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) or [Sorin, Grim Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Grim+Nemesis).


White-Blue [Engulf the Shore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore) features an all-Island mana base to Engulf your board, do it all again with [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk), and eventually win by casting [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) off of [Irrigated Farmland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irrigated+Farmland).


Green-White Tokens, like before, can go for the mana curve of [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa); [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate); [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar); [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar); and [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn).


Day Two Conversion Summary
==========================


If we put everything we've learned into one humongous table, then we see that among the archetypes with at least five pilots, Flamecaller Temur Aetherworks, Black-Green [Cryptolith Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Rite), and Spell-Heavy Temur Aetherworks had the best conversion rates. Among archetypes with at least 40 pilots, Mono-Black Zombies did the best.
