Welcome to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Some weeks, we can barely cram all the changes in. This week is not one of those weeks. Some weeks, with a single Grand Prix and only a handful of ranked players taking part, there is one clearcut standout story. This week is not one of those weeks. Some weeks, despite multiple events, no ranked players demand the full-on glare of the spotlight, and instead we’re left with a large number of pros jockeying for position, often in the middle of the table. This week is not one of those weeks either.


This week, we could give you the headline, “Disaster for Hayne.” We could take it from the personal to the geographic, and go with, “Canada in freefall as Hayne plummets,” which has the added virtue of getting ‘plummet’ into the rankings tale this week. Or, if we wanted to be positive, we could offer, “Wescoe roars back” or “USA moves into high gear as Wescoe makes his move.”


Or, we could tell you that there were no events last weekend, and that, as a result of the decay in points from last season, Alexander Hayne and Craig Wescoe landed in a tie at No. 20. Let’s do that. Now all we need is a headline. How about this?


‘Pros spend weekend with Significant Others; Shop; Clean; Play *Magic*. Will return soon.’


That sums it up nicely.
