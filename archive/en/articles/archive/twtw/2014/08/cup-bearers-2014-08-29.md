Brace yourself. *Khans of Tarkir* previews are right around the corner and competitive *Magic* is getting set for its biggest overhaul of the tournament year. That means that this is the best opportunity we will have to talk about the upcoming Community Cup, which takes place the second weekend of September. Each year, a team of *Magic Online*–centric community members is selected to do battle against a team of employees from Wizards of the Coast for the Erik "Hamtastic" Friborg Memorial Trophy.

It is a fun tournament with crazy formats reminiscent of those long-ago Invitationals. At the same time, neither team wants to come out of it without a trophy to hoist and the good-natured competition at the start of Day One often evolves into straight-up competition by the last leg of the event. I will be part of the coverage team bringing all three days of the action (yes, three days—more on that in a bit!) and I will be working with Marshall Sutcliffe, who was a member of a victorious Community Team just a few seasons ago.

"Being selected for the Community Team signaled a big change in my life," recalled Sutcliffe, who was still in the early days of his wildly popular [Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/) podcast at the time. "I viewed myself as a member of the community before that, but after, I thought of myself as someone who had some responsibility to set standards for the community that I would be proud of. It was a huge honor and I took it seriously."



Anyone who has ever listened to the bottom line advice that Sutcliffe dishes out about drafting on his podcast knows exactly what type of player he is and should not be surprised to learn what order he prioritized the spirit of the event against getting his hands on the trophy.


"I know it seems like it's all fun and games during the Community Cup, but I'm a Spike, and during the games I felt the pressure to crush our Wizards of the Coast enemies. When we walked into the Wizards parking lot holding the trophy, it felt like pure justice." He then laid down the gauntlet for this year's team. "I expect nothing short of victory from the Community Team. They must defend our title. I would prefer an outright rout, but will settle for nothing less than victory and glory."


Sutcliffe prides himself on his professional broadcast demeanor but was ready to put that to the side for three days in September.


"I take journalistic integrity quite seriously at Grand Prix and the Pro Tour, but at the Community Cup, I tone it down a bit and will unabashedly be rooting for the Community Team," he said flatly.


Formats for the weekend include the cooking-competition-inspired Ironroot Chef, *Vintage Masters* draft, and eight-booster Sealed Deck with the boosters being picked by the community, but those were not the format Sutcliffe was most looking forward to. Surprisingly, the Spiky drafter enjoys Stipulation Draft the most. The players participate in a Cube Draft but are bound by certain stipulations that have to override their normal draft choices—such as having to take the most expensive card, nonbasic land, or card that most sounds like a band name out of each pack.


"I love the layering of drafting the stipulations themselves, working within them during the draft and deck build, and then playing out the matches."


The year after Sutcliffe and the rest of the Community Team won for the third straight Cup, the unthinkable happened. Wizards of the Coast emerged victorious in 2012, and it was a devastating blow to everyone on the team that year—none of whom were willing to comment. The only response to interview requests from the 2012 team was an all-caps, expletive laden text from Conley Woods that is not suitable for publication.

The Community managed to right the ship last season with a team that included [Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/welcome) Top 8 competitor Melissa DeTora, who looked back very fondly at the experience.



"Playing in the Community Cup was one of the best experiences in my *Magic* career," said the longtime professional player. "I got to visit Wizards of the Coast and get treated like a celebrity for a week. Getting to meet the members of R&D was awesome and the event itself was super laid back and fun. There was also much less pressure on me to win than at a competitive event like a Pro Tour. Our team was so talented that there was no way we could possibly lose!"

DeTora described being selected to the team as an unexpected honor that really opened her eyes about how much her success in the game has meant to the ever-expanding *Magic* community.



"After the announcement was made that I was on the team, I got lots of emails and Facebook messages saying how awesome it was that I made it, and also how much people look up to me as a player," said DeTora, who was the first female *Magic* player to make the Top 8 of a Pro Tour.


Despite all the feel-goods of being selected, the team came into last year with a very definite mission in mind.


"Winning the Cup was very important to me," said DeTora. "The Community lost the year before and it was pretty embarrassing, and I didn't want the Community let down again for the second year in a row. It definitely felt good to crush the Wizards team after all of the trash talking they did to us! And the tournament itself was an absolute blowout. We only needed like two match wins—out of twenty-four—going into the final draft and we were already celebrating before the draft even started."


"Returning the Cup to the Community is ranked pretty highly on my list of career achievements. It's pretty hard to top 'Making Top 8 of a Pro Tour,' but winning a tournament for the entire *Magic* community is a great feeling. You are winning not only for yourself but also for your team, friends, and every *Magic* player out there. Plus, I got to get my revenge on a bunch of great *Magic* players (Wizards R&D) who used to beat me at *Magic* when I started playing. The Community Cup was the most fun tournament I've ever played in and I'd love to play in it again."


While she is not competing, DeTora has an extra rooting interest in the 2014 Community Team, as her boyfriend Frank Lepore will be heading to Seattle to compete this year. With the ever-changing formats, it was hard to give him strategic advice, but she was confident that he will be well prepared and was able to offer some operational advice based on last year's experience.

"The formats are completely different from last year, except for Ironroot Chef, which I told him all about. I also explained how the computers are set up and how to best communicate with your teammates throughout the drafts. I think Frank will do really well, especially considering that we've done about 80 *Vintage Masters* drafts together on *Magic Online*. You can say he has that format down. As long as he doesn't get a crazy rule in the Wacky Draft he should be fine."



Playing for the Wizards of the Coast team this year will be none other than Hélène Bergeot, the director of global organized play at Wizards of the Coast. While Bergeot is ubiquitous on social media communicating with players about the game, she rarely has sat across from them and rolled to see who will go first.

"I enjoy interacting with the *Magic* community but I'm not exactly an avid gamer; participating in the Community Cup is my way to get closer to the players—both the Community Team members and the viewers," she explained. She added that she has been doing her homework to do her part to regain control of the Cup. "I've asked one of my coworkers to coach me. Playing *Magic* is fun and it is also a great way to learn how to lose with style, but I feel it's time to get that trophy back. Preparing for this event feels the same to me as practicing before a kickboxing evaluation."



While Bergeot was preparing to do battle she was most looking forward to a special treat that is in store for the Community Team on Sunday.


"Sunday will be very exciting for the community members, as they'll play a *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck tournament, one week before the Prerelease. For the viewers, it'll be the first opportunity to get a nice peek at the new set." The spotlight single-elimination tournament will pit these eight players in head-to-head competition with all five wedges in play.

Getting invited to the Community Cup is about more than just your prowess as a *Magic* player, and honestly anyone out there reading this could find yourself playing in it next year by putting yourself out there and fostering the tribe of *Magic* players. I asked my guests this week about what they thought people at home could be doing to put themselves in a position to be invited to be a member of the Community Team in 2015.


**Sutcliffe:** The number one thing to do is find what you love about *Magic* and the community, and then be consistent about doing it. It doesn't matter if it's podcasting, writing articles, doing videos, moderating forums, beta testing, streaming, or anything else. The key is that you are consistent. That gets you in front of more people. The next step is to be a decent human being and to always consider how your actions may affect other people. You don't have to be fake, and you don't have to campaign like a politician. You just have to be consistent and be a reasonable human being. The rest will fall into place.


**DeTora:** Besides the obvious advice of get yourself out there by streaming, writing articles, or doing podcasts, the most important advice I can give is don't be a jerk. *Magic* has variance and there will be times where you will get mana screwed or flooded or just not draw the right cards. Take the loss and don't be salty, maybe even offer a handshake. You can't change things out of your control so what's the point in complaining to your opponent or your friends about how you "should have" won your match. It just makes you look bad. Be a good sport and stop complaining.


**Bergeot:** I would suggest streaming on a regular basis as learning from others is so important in *Magic*. And the more entertaining the stream, the better.
