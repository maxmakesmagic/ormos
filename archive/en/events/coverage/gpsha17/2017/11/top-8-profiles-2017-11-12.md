### Takuma Morofuji


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpsha17/T8_TakumaMorofuji.jpg)


**City, Country:** Fukuoka, Japan


**Age:** 36


**Occupation:** Company Employee


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**  Grand Prix Kobe 2015 Champion


**Day 1 Score:** 9 - 0 (3 byes)


**Day 2 Score:** 6 - 0


**What was the most important card or secret tech in your deck, and why?**


[Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent). It's great!


**What is your best and your worst matchup?**


The best matchup for me is the mirror, especially in the Top 8 because I will be playing first. Ironically, I also feel like it is the worst matchup because the mirror can sometimes be a coin flip.


**What was your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Going 15 - 0 in the Swiss Rounds.

[Nicol Bolas, God-Pharaoh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+God-Pharaoh)! Super, ultra, crazy cool!


**What is your best and your worst matchup?**


Temur Energy is my best matchup because I think I have a good sideboard plan (4 [Vizier of Many Faces](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Many+Faces)). My worst matchup is Ramunap Red. Turn-four [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent) is GG.

Happy birthday to Azusa Nakano, my idol!

**City, Country:** Beijing, China


**Age:** 34

**Day 1 Score:** 8 - 1 (2byes)


**Day 2 Score:** 4 - 1 - 1


**What was the most important card or secret tech in your deck, and why?**


I play 1 [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and 1 [Supreme Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Will) in the main deck and the [River's Rebuke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River%27s+Rebuke) in the sideboard helped me win three mirror matches.


**What is your best and your worst matchup?**


Temur Energy or 4-Color Energy are great matchups and I won all of them this weekend. Ramunap Red is my bad matchup because I sacrificed that matchup when I tuned this decklist.


**What was your favorite memory of the weekend?**


My teammate's company successfully got listed and we are getting a free dinner!

**Day 1 Score:** 8 - 1 (1 bye)


**Day 2 Score:** 4 - 1 - 1


**What was the most important card or secret tech in your deck, and why?**


The secret tech is to play a Grand Prix during your birthday month and ask Yam Wing Chun for a Mono Red decklist.


**What is your best and your worst matchup?**


Sultan Energy, based on discussions with my local playtesting group, HBD.


**What was your favorite memory of the weekend?**

**City, Country:** Hong Kong

**Day 1 Score:** 8 - 1 (3 byes)

**What was the most important card or secret tech in your deck, and why?**


[Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent). It is the backbone of Ramunap Red and it helped me gain a lot of success recently.


**What is your best and your worst matchup?**


4-Color Energy or Sultai Energy. Traditional wisdom suggests that monocolored decks have an edge over multicolored decks.


**What was your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Making Top 8 together with Lee Wing Tat from my local playtesting group, HBD, and also with Team MTG Mint Card teammate Kelvin Chew.

### Kelvin Chew

**City, Country:** Singapore


**Age:** 31


**Occupation:** MTG Mint Card Pro Player


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**  Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* Top 8, Top 4 at 2017 World Championships, and 4 other Grand Prix Top 8s.


**Day 1 Score:** 8 - 1 (3 byes)


**Day 2 Score:** 4 - 2


**What was the most important card or secret tech in your deck, and why?**


[Vizier of Many Faces](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Many+Faces). It allows me to copy the best creature on the battlefield.


**What is your best and your worst matchup?**


Ramunap Red is my best matchup because [Whirler Virtuoso](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirler+Virtuoso) is too good against them. White-Blue Approach is the worst because Game 1 is basically unwinnable.


**What was your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Lost Round 10 against Yam Wing Chun and then making the Top 8 together with him.

### Okada Naoya

**City, Country:** Nagano, Japan

**Day 1 Score:** 7 - 2 (2 byes)


**Day 2 Score:** 5 - 1


**What was the most important card or secret tech in your deck, and why?**


[Inventor's Goggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventor%27s+Goggles). It's such a good artifact for just one mana.


**What is your best and your worst matchup?**


Ramona Red is a good matchup because I have many tokens and I can block Hazoret forever. White-Blue Approach or any control deck is the worst because they have a lot of mass removal.


**What was your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Getting lost in Shanghai but eventually managing to find my way to the hotel. Thanks for Hekyle!

[Invigorated Rampage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorated+Rampage). It solves the problems of Ramunap Red and turns losses into wins.


**What is your best and your worst matchup?**


I feel confident against Temur Energy because I practiced the matchup a lot. As for my worst matchup, it's any deck with a lot of tokens.


**What was your favorite memory of the weekend?**


Making my first Grand Prix Top 8 and qualifying for my very first Pro Tour.
