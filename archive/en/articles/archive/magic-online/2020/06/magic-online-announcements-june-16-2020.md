Legacy Challenge Update
-----------------------


Starting this weekend, we are returning the Legacy Challenge to a minimum of 32 players needed to launch the event. That minimum had been changed to 64 players for Season 2 based on turnout, but we are now reverting that change.


This also means it will use the 32-player-minimum prize structure as listed on the [Premier Play information page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020).

*Legacy Cube* June 10–25
------------------------


Do you like that one card, from that one set, and you just never see it anymore? Fear not, *Legacy Cube* returns June 10, and you may see it again! *Legacy Cube* is full of some of the best cards from across *Magic*'s history, working together in ways you can only experience in a cube. And the fun doesn't stop for two weeks, ending June 25.


Full information on the contents of the Legacy Cube can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/legacy-cube-cardlist).
