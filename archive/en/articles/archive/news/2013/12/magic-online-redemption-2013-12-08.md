Magic Online: Redemption
========================



 Posted in **News**
 on December 8, 2013 











**Magic Online** includes an innovative feature that allows players who have collected a complete set of digital cards to redeem it for a complete set of physical cards. To collect a complete set, you must have at least one of every card that was released online for the specific expansion set you are trying to redeem.


There are typically two types of redemption for each **Magic Online** set release: Standard and Premium Foil. Occasionally a set may have additional types of redemption, such as *Time Spiral*'s [Timeshifted set](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1124), but those sets seldom occur. In addition, some **Magic Online** sets and limited releases may not be eligible for redemption.


**Standard Set:** A Standard Set includes one of each card within a specific expansion. If a set includes basic land cards, those specific land cards must be in your collection. If you have premium foil versions of any cards in the set, those cards **DO NOT** count toward your Standard Set. Note: Some sets may have promotional cards that may or may not be required for redemption. These exceptions will be noted in the Redemption Request for the set you are redeeming.


**Premium Foil Set:** A Premium Foil Set includes one premium foil version of each card within a specific expansion. If a set includes basic land cards, those specific land cards must be in your collection. If you have standard versions of any cards in the set, those cards **DO NOT** count toward your Premium Set. Note: Some sets may have promotional cards that may or may not be required for redemption. These exceptions will be noted in the Redemption Request for the set you are redeeming.


To redeem one or more of your physical sets, you need to purchase a Redemption Request for the set(s) that you want to redeem from the **Magic Online** Store. You can purchase as many Redemption Requests as you have the cards for in one order. There is a $25.00 charge for handling per set redeemed. For every set released prior to February 1, 2013, (including Return to Ravnica and all previously released sets) we charge $5.00 handling per set redeemed and a flat shipping fee ($2.99 in the U.S. or $29.99 outside of the U.S.) for each order. Please note that your shipping address MUST be in the same country as your billing address or your redemption order will not be shipped. In addition, you will be obligated to pay any sales tax, VAT, duties, or import fees charged by your state and/or country. Your Redemption Request will process during the next applicable **Magic Online** downtime, at which point we will take the cards out of your **Magic Online** account and send a confirmation email. Please note that it can take up to 10 days to process your Redemption Request and an additional 1-3 weeks to ship your Redemption Set.


Example: You have collected 800 *Shards of Alara* cards in **Magic Online**, including one of each standard non-foil card. You decide that you want to redeem your *Shards of Alara* set, so you purchase a *Shards of Alara* Redemption Request (Standard) from the **Magic Online** Store. If you live in the U.S. you will pay a $7.99 plus sales tax. If you live outside of the U.S. you will pay $34.99 plus VAT and any duties or import fees charged by the country you live it. During the next applicable downtime, your Redemption Request is processed and we will remove the 249-card digital set -- leaving you 551 *Shards of Alara* cards in your online collection -- and send a paper set of *Shards of Alara* to the shipping address listed on your **Magic Online** account.


As a general rule **Magic Online** sets will be available for redemption roughly one month after they are released. If a redeemable set runs out of stock before its Redemption Guarantee Date, the set will be reprinted. After a redeemable set's Redemption Guarantee Date has passed, such set will be available while supplies last or until the set's Cutoff Date, whichever comes first. For a list of redeemable sets, their Redemption Guarantee Date, and their Cutoff Date, [click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Digital/MagicOnline.aspx?x=mtg/digital/magiconline/calendar#core).


**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** All **Magic Online** redemptions are final! Once the cards are removed from your account, the order cannot be reversed and you will not be refunded for your redemption order. Please make sure you want to redeem your cards before purchasing your Redemption Request.
