Last week was something of a week of mourning here on DailyMTG.com, as we took a look at the life and, sadly, death, of Elspeth on Theros. You can read a summary of the whole story in last week's "[Journey's End](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/301)" feature.
