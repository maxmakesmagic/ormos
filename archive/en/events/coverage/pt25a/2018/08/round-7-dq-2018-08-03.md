Dan Ward has been disqualified from Pro Tour 25th Anniversary. Since this is a team Pro Tour, his team was disqualified as well.


During Round 7, Ward's opponent activated [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial). Ward allowed the ability to resolve, which his opponent used to put a [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) into play. Ward attempted to then cast [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on another creature "in response" to [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) naming a card when there was no window to respond.


During the investigation, Ward argued he thought [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage)'s ability was a triggered ability upon entering play. However, after investigation, judges determined Ward knew that [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) was not a triggered ability and that his statements to his opponent and the judges were attempts to undo his mistake of not casting [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) in response to the [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) activation.
