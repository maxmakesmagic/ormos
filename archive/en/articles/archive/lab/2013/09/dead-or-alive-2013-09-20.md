Hello, and welcome to Dead or Alive?, where the only thing crazier than the combos is the host! Today's contestants come to us all the way from the plane of Theros. First up, it's [Ashen Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Rider)! Say hello, Ash!


**Ash:** Hi.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl266_ash.jpg)[Ashen Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Rider) | Art by [Chris Rahn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=[%22Chris+Rahn%22])


A man of few words. I like it! It says here Ash that you're an Archon, a sort of magical arbiter of justice, is that correct?


**Ash:** Yes.


Wonderful, wonderful! Ash's specialty is exiling permanents. He'll get rid of one as soon as you summon him to battle, and if he falls in battle, he gets rid of a second as his final act. What a great guy!


Our second contestant is [Gift of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Immortality)! Why don't you say hi to all the folks back home, Morty?


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl266_morty.jpg)[Gift of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Immortality) | Art by [Matt Stewart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=[%22Matt%20Stewart%22])


**Morty:** Hey Mike, it's a real honor to be here. I'd just like to thank my best friend [Indestructibility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indestructibility) for encouraging me to come on your show. Thanks, Bill!


So Morty, it says here that you're an Aura. Would you mind explaining to our audience what you do?


**Morty:** Sure, no problem! You see, if you have a creature you really like, you can cast me to protect it. If the creature dies, I'll bring it back from the graveyard for you, then follow myself to make sure it stays protected.


Excellent! I'm sure that comes in handy on the battlefield.


**Morty:** It sure does, Mike.


All right! Let's get started. We're going to put each of you through a series of scenarios that will have you popping in and out of graveyards like mad. Your job is to guess whether the other contestant is dead or alive, just like the name of the show. Got it?

**Ash:** Yes.


**Morty:** Sounds good, Mike.


Wonderful! Now, we'll start off the scenarios with Ash, which means Morty, you're guessing.


**Morty:** Right!


**Ash:** Okay.


All right, now Morty, Ash and two [Archon of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice)s end up [Buried Alive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive), when an [Apprentice Necromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apprentice+Necromancer) brings him back from the grave. After a turn, is he dead or alive?


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=buried+alive)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Apprentice+Necromancer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Apprentice+Necromancer)


**Morty:** Well, the necromancer reanimated him, so I'm going to say alive.


Oh! I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Although Ash was indeed reanimated, the necromancer was only an apprentice, so the spell would wear off after a short time.


**Morty:** Aw, man!


Now, you've used up your extra life, so one more wrong answer and your round is over. Hope you have better luck this time, because here comes question number two! For this scenario, we're going to bring in Ash's brother, Rider. Why don't you say hello to our lovely studio audience, Rider?


**Rider**: Hi.


Yes, I see the family resemblance. Okay, now Ash 'n Rider are chilling in the graveyard when a [Tireless Tribe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe) dies because of a [Recurring Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare). Don't ask me how, but this makes Ash suddenly come back to life. Then Ash has the same nightmare, bringing back his brother. So, Morty? Dead or alive?


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tireless+Tribe)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Recurring+Nightmare)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare)


**Morty:** Ash is dead. It's Rider who's alive.


Correct! That's one point to Morty, and you are still hanging on. All right, time for question number three. Rider, do you mind if we borrow you again for this one?


**Rider**: No.


Excellent! In this scenario, Rider is in the graveyard, while Ash is on the battlefield. [Hell's Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1444) is a bit of a fickle guy, and decides he wants the other brother instead, so he forces them to switch places. Certainly not a bad thing for the Planeswalker in charge, who gets to exile two permanents. Soon, the Caretaker changes his mind again, and switches the two brothers a second time. Morty, is Ash dead or alive?


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hell%27s+Caretaker)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Caretaker)


**Morty:** Let's see... Ash started out on the battlefield, then switched with Rider, putting him in the graveyard. He then switched again, putting him back on the battlefield. Ash is alive.


That's right! Chalk up one more point for Morty! You certainly seem to be getting into the groove now! Think you can keep it going?


**Morty:** Well I need to set a high bar for Ash here, so I certainly hope so.


Let's see if you can raise that bar to three points! Here comes number four. Ash has been [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed by his Planeswalker, then a few turns later, he's forced to follow in the [Footsteps of the Goryo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Footsteps+of+the+Goryo). Then the Soldier on the opposite side of the battlefield attacks. Morty, dead or alive?


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=entomb)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Footsteps+of+the+Goryo)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Footsteps+of+the+Goryo)


Morty: Hmm.... I know that [Footsteps of the Goryo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Footsteps+of+the+Goryo) only lasts for a short time, but this time you didn't say the turn had ended, so I'm going to go with alive.


Oh! Such a shame! The correct answer was dead. [Footsteps of the Goryo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Footsteps+of+the+Goryo) can only be cast on your turn, and the opponent's Soldier could only have attacked if we had moved to his or her turn, so the reanimation effect would have expired. Sorry Morty, but that was your last life, and this round is over. Let's pull up a review for the folks at home.
