 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 







Several months ago, I [announced](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/236) the start of You Make the Card #3. The twist this time was that we were going to begin by allowing the audience to vote on a piece of art. And not just any piece of art but one created by the audience. Once that vote was finished, we would then design the card top down using the chosen art as inspiration.


For those unfamiliar with this feature, let me quickly explain. We are going to let all of you, the **magicrhegathering.com** readers, design a **Magic** card. Each step we will give you decisions and let you vote. The outcome of each vote will determine what step we take next.


After my call for art, we received 261 submissions. Then Jeremy Cranford (**Magic**â€™s Art Director) with help from the **Magic** Creative Team (Brady Dommermuth, Brandon Bozzi, Matt Cavotta, Doug Alexander and myself) selected the top ten pieces. Today we will be voting on which of those ten pieces all of you wish to build the card around. (As always, we will not be announcing the artists of the pieces until after the vote.)


The vote begins today (see below) and lasts until midnight this Friday. Enjoy!
