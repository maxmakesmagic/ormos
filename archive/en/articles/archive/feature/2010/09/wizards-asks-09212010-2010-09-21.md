**Ken Nagle:** I'm most excited to open Argentum Armor, mostly because it's my submitted design.

To me, nothing is more "Mirrodin" than Equipment, and I felt *Scars of Mirrodin* needed the "biggest Equipment ever," both for my [Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord) EDH deck and for shenanigans with [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) / [Stonehewer Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehewer+Giant) (again, my designs).
