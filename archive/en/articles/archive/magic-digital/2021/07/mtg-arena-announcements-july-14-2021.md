MTG Arena Announcements, July 14, 2021

Play Adventures in the Forgotten Realms Now on All Platforms!
=============================================================


The wait is over—*Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* is now available on *MTG Arena*! Check out Jay Parker’s [State of the Game article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-02) for a closer look at what awaits you in the new set that brings together two of the most popular fantasy games in history.


Standard 2022: The Book of Exalted Deeds is Banned
==================================================


In the Standard 2022 format, The Book of Exalted Deeds is now banned. This will happen with the *MTG Arena* release this Friday morning, July 16. It will not require a client update.


When The Book of Exalted Deeds is combined with Faceless Haven, a player could control a land which prevented them from losing the game and it was highly unlikely the opponent had a way to remove it.


While this deck was not dominant either by win rate or percentage of players playing the combo, running into it was a very frustrating experience. If both players were using it, the game would have no way to end until one player finally decided to concede. This is not the game play experience we are aiming to provide.


It should be noted that this ban does *not* mean The Book of Exalted Deeds will be banned in Standard after format rotation with the release of *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*.


Standard 2022 is Best-of-One, which removes the ability to sideboard against the combo. It's also only a format on *MTG Arena*, which has different considerations than formats played in tabletop. And, of course, *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* will be legal in Standard after rotation but is not available in Standard 2022.


Note that wildcard grants are not used for bans in Standard 2022. The Book of Exalted Deeds can still be used in both Standard and Historic play on *MTG Arena*.


Recent Bug Fixes
================


A deployment on Friday, July 9, fixed some high-profile bugs that occurred with the *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* release:


* Fixed: a bug that caused effects that search for basic lands by type (like the second chapter of Binding the Old Gods) to only be able to get basic lands.
* Fixed: a bug that caused the screen to shake at inappropriate times.
* Fixed: a bug that caused level 3 of Paladin Class to provide the wrong power/toughness bonus.

FNM at Home is now Midweek *Magic*!
===================================


The first Midweek *Magic* event is now in progress: Future Precons! Play with preconstructed decks legal in Standard 2022 (sets include *Zendikar Rising*, *Kaldheim*, *Strixhaven: School of Mages*, and *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*).


Midweek *Magic* events run weekly from Tuesday at 8 a.m. PT through Thursday at 8 a.m. PT with a different format each week. [Midweek *Magic*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-02#midweekmagic) has no entry fee, and you can earn two rare individual card rewards—just like FNM at Home.


Codes for an *MTG Arena* cosmetic are still available from your local game store (in person, if pandemic restrictions allow in your area, or online).


Standard Metagame Challenge
===========================


Returning this weekend, July 17–20, is the Standard Metagame Challenge!


Bring your 60-card Standard deck and compete in Traditional Standard Best-of-Three (single-elimination) matches to win great prizes—including chances for *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* packs. Make it a seven-win sweep, and you’ll score 5,000 gold and 30 packs! Entry is 2,000 gold or 400 gems.


Sharpen Your Standard 2022 Skills
=================================


Here’s a chance to get ahead of the next Standard rotation! Join Standard 2022 Play and Standard 2022 Ranked Best-of-One queues in *MTG Arena* to play with the sets that are legal in Standard after [the rotation](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/renewal-mtg-arenas-2021-standard-rotation-2021-07-02): *Zendikar Rising*, *Kaldheim*, *Strixhaven: School of Mages*, and *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*.
