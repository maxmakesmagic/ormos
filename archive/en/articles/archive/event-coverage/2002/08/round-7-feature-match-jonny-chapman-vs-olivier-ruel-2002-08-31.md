![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/951.jpg)This is a bad match up for Olivier, his Blue-Black [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)-Zombie deck against Jonny's mono-black deck. As soon as he sat down Ruel offered the draw as he had played a few friendly games against myself earlier in the day with the same deck and lost them all. It is possible for the black deck to draw too many anti-creature cards.

### Game One

Chapman started the game with a very land heavy hand. He played a second turn [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper) and Ruel had a [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation). After the Creeper traded for two of Olivier's cards Ruel dropped a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) which Chapman was forced to break with a [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion). Olivier immediately dropped another one. Olivier and Jonny both sacrificed a land a turn for a long time, until Ruel decided to make a second Zombie and start attacking. Olivier by this time had only one land in play but as Chapman was trying hard not to break [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) he was taking a lot of damage. He had the option to play his own Infestation, which might have been the thing to do, especially when Olivier had only one land in his hand.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/952.jpg)Jonny laid a land every turn for a while but it was no longer looking so good for him when he had to start sacrificing his land to [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids). Ruel realized this and decided to hold the Zombie tokens back for a while, since Jonny would probably block with [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids), and he was soon going to be forced to sacrifice it.

Chapman attempted the Infestation at last, but it was countered with a [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). When Olivier had another [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) for a [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper), Jonny had to concede to the Zombies.

### Game Two

Jonny sideboarded in his [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive), a [Filth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filth), and a fourth [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid). "I hope your sideboard is as bad as mine", joked Olivier, since he had precisely zero useful cards against the deck.

The Englishman decided to go first, with a good draw including [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade), [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation), and [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive), although it only had two lands. He played the Infestation on turn two, and since discarded [Filth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filth) and an Edict to make a token. When he drew his third land, he cast [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) to fetch an [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) and two more [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper)s.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/953.jpg)Jonny's draw also included two [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), and they totally wrecked Olivier as they could combo fantastically with the [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid). A couple of turns later Ruel had to concede as a second [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) put two more [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)s into the graveyard. During the entire game Olivier didn't cast any spells except for [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) and a flashbacked [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).

### Game Three

Jonny started off game three with a [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), but named [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) and missed, since Oliver only had a [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) and a [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher), with some lands. Jonny played a second turn [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) and decided not to flashback his Therapy to deal with the Butcher permanently. Unfortunately for Jonny he had drawn a lot of [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)s and not enough black creatures to back them up, and Ruel managed to draw a [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) and a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) in quick succession to lock the game up while Chapman had [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)s in his graveyard and no other creatures. Jonny was soon forced to scoop to multiple Zombie tokens.
