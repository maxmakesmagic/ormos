**Legacy Festival Moves from Discover to Assemble with *Eternal Masters***


*Magic Online* has festivals to celebrate a format and its players, as well as to encourage others to join in on the fun. Interested in playing Legacy but haven't given it a try? Already play and want to get your friends to join you? This festival is the time! The Legacy Festival will walk players through the essential steps to discovering a format:


* DISCOVER (JUNE 8–16): A way to try out the format. Learn about the different decks, see what the metagame is like, and find a deck that you want to play.
* ASSEMBLE (JUNE 16–JULY 6): Play the new *Eternal Masters* set for an an opportunity to acquire cards you'll need for your deck.
* CONQUER (JULY 6–JULY 24): Once you've gotten your deck together, a way to play for some sweet prizes when you jump in and take on the competition.

The [Legacy Gauntlet "Discover" phase](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-legacy-festival-discover-assemble-conquer-2016-05-13#Discover) of the Legacy Festival is on until Thursday, June 16, 10:00 a.m. PT/5:00 p.m. UTC and is immediately followed up by the *Eternal Masters* "Assemble" phase! The Legacy Festival's second phase is where you can start assembling your Legacy deck of choice via *Eternal Masters* Events that kick-off right after the Legacy Gauntlet's conclusion! Get the full *Eternal Masters* Event details [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-legacy-festival-discover-assemble-conquer-2016-05-13#Assemble).

**Build Notes**


**Gameplay**


* Cardset | Many activated abilities now require the use of a context menu to avoid unintentional activations. Notably, this includes the activated abilities of both [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator).
* Duel Scene | Players can now use the Undo function (mapped to Ctrl+Z by default) when using a spell or ability that allows them to sacrifice a creature to add mana to their mana pool. This does not apply to creatures that sacrifice themselves to add mana to the mana pool, such as Eldrazi Scion tokens.
* Duel Scene | While resolving [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), players can now undo selecting a creature while resolving [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and still put two creatures onto the battlefield.
* Duel Scene | When paying for a spell or ability that requires multiple payment steps (such as a mana payment step and a sacrifice step), using the Undo function after making the first payment no longer causes the player to be unable to pay for the spell or ability.
* Duel Scene | Several other bugs involving the Undo function not listed here have been resolved.
* Cardset | If [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) is granted lifelink while her transform trigger is on the stack, the damage dealt by [Avacyn, the Purifier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+the+Purifier)'s triggered ability now properly grants life to her controller.
* Cardset | [Devastating Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devastating+Dreams) now allows players to discard any number of cards from their hand.
* Cardset | [Reflecting Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool) can again reflect mana from [Gemstone Caverns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Caverns), [Urza's Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Mine), [Urza's Power Plant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Power+Plant), or [Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower).
* Cardset | [Creeping Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Dread) no longer causes players to incorrectly lose life in certain scenarios.
* Cardset | A non-functional Cancel button no longer displays when resolving the abilities of [Sinister Concoction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinister+Concoction) and [Tooth Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+Collector).
* Cardset | [Brain in a Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+in+a+Jar)’s first activated ability no longer automatically resolves when its controller does not have an instant or sorcery card with the appropriate converted mana cost in their hand.
* Cardset | Several minor visual irregularities have been resolved involving promotional cards, planeswalkers, and clue tokens.
* Cardset | The game log now informs players if a player chooses not to return any creature cards to their hand with [Corpse Churn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Churn).
* Cardset | [Lotus Blossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Blossom)'s mana ability once again functions as intended.
* Duel Scene | A bug that caused delayed triggered abilities to not appear in the Effects area has been resolved.
* General | Cards from *Shadows over Innistrad* are now legal in the Freeform Vanguard format.
* Cardset | Players are no longer forced to cast cards with suspend when the last time counter is removed from them if an additional cost is applied to the spell.
* Cardset | [Aether Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Mutation) once again properly creates tokens.
* Cardset | If a player casts [Predict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predict) or [Foreshadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foreshadow), accurately naming one name of a split card (such as [Fire // Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+%2F%2F+Ice)) put into the graveyard by the spell, the player now properly draws two cards.
* Cardset | The triggered ability of [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) (and [Planar Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Void), etc.) that exiles cards put into its controller’s graveyard no longer causes those exiled cards to appear dimmed on the battlefield under it.

* Cardset | [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) can no longer create tokens if [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) resolved earlier in the turn, even if an opponent’s creature dies as a result of a state-based action.
* Cardset | [Soulflayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulflayer) now correctly gains abilities from cards exiled with its delve ability.
* Cardset | The legend rule now correctly applies if more than two [Brothers Yamazaki](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brothers+Yamazaki) are in play. After the legend rule is applied, there can be only one.
* Cardset | The cast option menu displayed when a player clicks [Harbinger of the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides) in their hand is now ordered with the normal “Cast” option on top, consistent with other such menus.
* Duel Scene | If a player changes the size or location of the window that displays the top card of their library (for example, if they have a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) in play), those changes now properly persist between games.
