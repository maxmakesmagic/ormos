![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsev03/a894.jpg)*Eivind Nitter always smiles. Always.*An European Champion is going to make the semifinals in this Grand Prix. Germany's David Brucker won the title this year and Norway's Eivind Nitter was victorious in 2001.

David drafted a white/blue deck and is splashing some red for [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) and [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill). His best card is a [Mistform Skyreaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Skyreaver). Eivind can easily compete with that – his first booster contained a [Silvos, Rogue Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos%2C+Rogue+Elemental) and his second a [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), which became even better with the introduction of Legions.

### Game 1

Nitter won the roll and decided to go first. His draw proved to be less then stellar as all he could do on his third turn was to cycle a land. David had a better draw, his [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) hit the table on his second turn and a [Mistform Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Wall) was the first creature on the table. Eivind answered seemingly disappointed with a [Skirk Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider), but David had a [Mage's Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mage%27s+Guile) ready and killed the 2/2 with the rift. The extra card still didn't provide Brucker with the 4th land though. Nitter dropped a [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) and attacked past David's freshly cast [Keeneye Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven).

He proceeded to draw his card, which turned out to be no [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and scooped up his cards, proclaiming that he doesn't feel like playing against such crappy cards.

Nitter 1 – Brucker 0

David boarded a [Disruptive Pitmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disruptive+Pitmage) to give him a small chance to deal with the Pit Fighter and chose to go play first.

### Game 2

Both players were happy with their hands again and Brucker let with a [Secluded Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Steppe). After cycling a [Forgotten Cave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Cave) on his first turn, Eivind played a second one on the following, holding a third. He cycled that on his third turn but could not cast a spell anyway. David had nothing on his third turn and sighed when he drew his card for his fourth, as all he could do was pass the turn, without playing a land or a spell. Nitter's attempt at [Skirk Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider) was met with a cycled [Complicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complicate) and that gave David his fourth land. A [Keeneye Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) followed on his turn and attacked on the next one after the Norwegian dropped a [Wirewood Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf) and his [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). The goblin looked a lot less threatening when the [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) was cast on David's next turn. Nitter was not really impressed. He drew his sixth land and cast his [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos). David had another excellent card in [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill) but it still didn't seem to be sufficient against a 8/5 regenerating beatstick. His attempt at racing the pit figher was met with a [Needleshot Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needleshot+Gourna) and David's fliers looked suddenly rather puny.

A Berserk Murodolont hit the table before Eivind entered his attack step. Being down to four life David had to chump the incoming [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos) and he blocked the Baloth as well, leaving himself without any creatures facing three creatures with a combined power of 14. David dealt Eivind six points with his [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) on his turn but then shook Nitter's hand and wished him good luck in the semifinals.

**Final Result:** Nitter def. Brucker, 2-0
