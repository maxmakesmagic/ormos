It's the week after [the Pro Tour](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk), and that means epic changes in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. The headlines:


**A new No. 1**—Owen Turtenwald may have lost in Round 16 to No. 7 Yuuya Watanabe for the right to claim his second Pro Tour Top 8, but his 11th-place finish, and the 15 Pro Points that came with it, was more than enough to knock Player of the Year Jérémy Dezani off the top spot. Owen is playing the *Magic* of his life right now, and it's no surprise to see him as our new World No. 1.


**The Winner**—Representing Team [TCGPlayer](http://www.tcgplayer.com/), Ari Lax put in a commanding performance in Honolulu. Studious, meticulous, and leaving as little as possible to chance, Lax was rewarded for years of dedication that have seen him close to, but not a true part of, the elite of the game. That changed Sunday with a comprehensive victory, taking out Yuuya Watanabe, Brazil's Thiago Saporito, and then Shaun McLaren in the final. In addition to Platinum Pro status, Lax joins the rankings as the new No. 7. Expect to see much more of our new Pro Tour champion over the coming months.


**New Entries**—Lax was the highest of six new entries on the chart. Raphaël Lévy and Shahar Shenhar both return to the Top 25, tied for No. 18. On the back of his Top 8 appearance in Honolulu, Mike Sigrist joins the Top 25 for the first time at No. 23. Longtime control player Andrew Cuneo—he's been designing world-beating control decks since the 1990s—enters at No. 24. And there's a welcome return for Christian Calcano, in at No. 25.


**Big Gains—**[Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptbng14) Champion Shaun McLaren came within a whisker of winning two Pro Tours in a year, before falling in four games to Lax in the final. He climbs five spots to No. 3. Also rising five is Yuuya Watanabe, who dominated Day One before claiming a third Pro Tour Top 8. He now sits at No. 6 in the table. The biggest gainer within the Top 25 was Lee Shi Tian, who showed admirable focus to take his Jeskai Ascendancy combo deck into the Top 8. He climbs eight spots to No. 8. And finally, away from the Top 8 spotlight, Ben Stark made the Top 16 in Honolulu, and moves up seven to No. 14.


**And Finally**—Ivan Floch made the Top 8 in Honolulu, and was the only player from last week's rankings not to move! He stays at No. 5, with Reid Duke, Shaun McLaren, Jérémy Dezani, and new No. 1 Owen Turtenwald firmly in his sights as we begin the next round of global Grand Prix.


Join us next week for another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
