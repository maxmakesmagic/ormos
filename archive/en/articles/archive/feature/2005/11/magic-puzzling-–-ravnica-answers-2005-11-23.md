Time for the answers to [Monday's puzzles](/en/articles/archive/magic-puzzling-%E2%80%93-ravnica-2005-11-21).

### Round 1, Game 3:

* Vhati has 31 cards in his graveyard, and 9 in play. That leaves exactly 20 cards left in his deck (since the required deck size was 60 cards).
* Tap all your land and your Signet for mana.
* Transmute [Dimir Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Infiltrator) into [Glimpse the Unthinkable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable).
* Transmute [Muddle the Mixture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) into [Twincast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast).
* Cast [Glimpse the Unthinkable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable) targeting Vhati, and copy it with [Twincast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast).
* Vhati has no cards left in his deck and will die on his next draw step.

### Round 2, Game 3:

* You must consider all the possible tricks that your opponent has. With no mana available, the only relevant options are:
	+ [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) for 1
	+ [Devouring Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light)
	+ [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) (for 0 or 1)
	+ [Gather Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Courage)
	+ [Sundering Vitae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Vitae) (targeting [Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength))
* The only way you can lose the game is to attack with [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal), and have the first strike damage [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal)ed back to you. Because of this, you will not attack with [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) unless you know you can avoid the Shoal.
* The only creatures that can stop you with [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) are [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) and [Kami of False Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+False+Hope).
* [Devouring Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light), [Sundering Vitae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Vitae), [Gather Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Courage), [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) with damage on the stack, and [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) for [Kami of False Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+False+Hope) will automatically force the game into a draw, so you cannot effectively play around those situations.
* Cast [Dizzy Spell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dizzy+Spell) targeting [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms). This will put Circu's ability on the stack. You might get lucky and pull [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) or [Kami of False Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+False+Hope) out of the deck.
* Your opponent can always respond to the trigger by casting [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) for [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). If they do, then you know they do not have an active [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) in their hand. Therefore, you can attack with [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal), and still have enough damage for the win.
* Cast [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) targeting [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms), using the same logic above.
* Assuming [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) was not cast, attack with everyone except [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal). Unless your opponent has a trick mentioned above, you will win the game.

### Round 3, Game 2:

* Tap all your lands and your Signet to get five each of Black and Blue mana.
* Use ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) to cast [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) for [Peel from Reality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peel+from+Reality), [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami), [Dimir Machinations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Machinations), and [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms).
* If you receive either card with Transmute:
+ Use ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) to transmute into [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker).
+ Cast [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker) with your remaining mana, exchanging [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer) for Stabwhiskers.
+ Pass the turn, and during her upkeep, your opponent will die to Stabwhisker's ability.

* If you receive [Peel from Reality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peel+from+Reality) and [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami):
+ Cast [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami).
+ Using ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), cast [Peel from Reality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peel+from+Reality), targeting your [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami) and the Doppleganger.
+ Recast [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami) and sacrifice it to tap Szadek.
+ Pump [Undercity Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undercity+Shade) twice, making it a 3/3.
+ Attack with [Undercity Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undercity+Shade) and [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer). Only one can be blocked, so you will win.

### Round 4, Game 2:

* Tap an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and cast [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami).
* Attack with [Mindleech Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindleech+Mass), [Undercity Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undercity+Shade), and [Wizened Snitches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizened+Snitches). Your opponent will be best off blocking the Mass, but will still take 3 damage and the Mass will trigger.
* Play [Auratouched Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) from his hand, fetching [Followed Footsteps](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Followed+Footsteps) out of your deck.
* Tap three more [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s and play [Copy Enchantment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copy+Enchantment), copying [Followed Footsteps](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Followed+Footsteps). Enchant your [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami).
* Pass the turn and let your opponent draw [Worship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship).
* During their draw step, tap your remaining mana and cast [Time Stop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stop).
* During your upkeep, your will receive a copy of [Auratouched Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) and [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami).
* Draw a card for your turn (assume it is something that will not help you).
* Pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) and sacrifice the [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami) copy to tap your opponent's token (the [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) does not affect the copy, since it is not a card).
* Attack with [Mindleech Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindleech+Mass), [Undercity Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undercity+Shade), [Wizened Snitches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizened+Snitches), [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami), and [Auratouched Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage). Your opponent will take all 12 damage, and be down to 4.
* Play [Worship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) from his hand.
* Tap [Llanowar Wastes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes), [Underground Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea), and 3 [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s to play [Soul Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Feast) targeting your opponent for the final 4 damage.

### Round 4, Game 3:

You have several ways of winning this game, but they are all in your deck. You can draw a single card with [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion), since [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) will not stop mana abilities. Your outs include:

* [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker) (3 mana)  
 Swap [Moroii](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moroii) for any of Argus's creatures. He will lose 1 life during his upkeep and lose the game.
* [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms) (6 mana)  
 Transmute into [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker), and use the [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker) solution.
* [Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex) (6 mana)  
 Cast [Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex) targeting every creature in play. [Booby Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Booby+Trap) will kill Argus during his upkeep.
* [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage) (7 mana)   
 Cast the Guildmage and use its ability to put a +1/+1 counter on [Necroplasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm). At the end of your turn all of Argus's creatures will die, and he will die from the [Booby Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Booby+Trap) during his upkeep.
* [Muddle the Mixture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) or [Dimir Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Infiltrator) (10 mana)  
 Transmute into [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage) and use that solution.
* [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) (7, 10, or 11 mana)  
 Search for [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage), [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker), [Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex), and any other card.
* [Twisted Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Justice) (9 or 12 mana)  
 Sacrifice [Necroplasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm) to draw four cards. You will win if you draw [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker) or transmute [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms) into [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker).

You can manipulate your library to change the odds of drawing certain cards. Your options include:

1. Sacrifice the [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion) immediately.
2. Transmute [Dizzy Spell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dizzy+Spell) into [Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength) to shuffle your library, then sacrifice the [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion).
3. Play Glimpse, transmute [Dizzy Spell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dizzy+Spell), sacrifice [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion).

Playing Glimpse without later randomizing your deck does not affect your odds. So which option is best?

1. If you just sacrifice the [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion), you have no chance of drawing the Guildmage or [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker), since they are near the bottom of your library. This leaves you [Muddle the Mixture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture), [Dimir Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Infiltrator), [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms), [Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex), or [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). The probability of drawing each of these is 1/24. You also have a 1/24 chance of drawing [Twisted Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Justice), in which case you can win if Drift of Phantasms is among the next four cards. The probability of that happening is 4/23, making the total probability of winning (1/24 \* 5) + (1/24 \* 4/23) = 119/552 ~ 21.6%.
2. If you transmute [Dizzy Spell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dizzy+Spell) and then sacrifice the [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion), you have 27 random cards in your library. Since you have 9 mana remaining, you can win with [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage), [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker), [Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex), or [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms). The probability of drawing each of these is 1/27. In addition, if you draw [Twisted Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Justice), you can win if [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker) is among the next four cards, which has a probability of 4/26. Hence, the total probability of winning is (1/27 \* 4) + (1/27 \* 4/26) ~ 15.4%.
3. If you play [Glimpse the Unthinkable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable), you mill yourself for 10. The probability that you will mill the 2 remaining 1-mana spells in your library is 10/24 \* 9/23 = 15/92. Therefore, when you transmute [Dizzy Spell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dizzy+Spell), you have a 15/92 chance to be left with an 18-card library, and a 77/92 chance to be left with a 17-card library. You will have seven mana remaining, so you will still win if you draw Guildmage, [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker), [Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex), or Drift. Since the Guildmage and [Spawnbroker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnbroker) are definitely still in your library, the probability of drawing each is (1/18 \* 15/92) + (1/17 \* 77/92) = 547/9384. [Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex) and Drift may be in your library or may be in the 10 cards that were milled, so the probability of drawing each is (1/28 \* 15/92) + (1/27 \* 77/92) = 2561/69552. The total probability of winning is therefore (2 \* 547/9384) + (2 \* 2561/69552) = 112459/591192 ~ 19.0%.

Your best option is therefore just to sacrifice the [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion) right away. (I'd like to thank [goblinrecruiter](http://boards1.wizards.com/member.php?u=361160) for pointing out a couple options I missed.)

Unfortunately, the odds were against you and you failed to draw either [Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex) or the [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage), and you lost the final game. That just reinforced the fact that **Magic** is both a game of skill and chance.

### Bonus Puzzle:

Below is an image of something I've been constructing for quite some time now. I add one new card to the matrix each day. Can anyone figure out what it is? Feel free to post guesses in the forums.
