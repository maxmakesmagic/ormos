Day 1 Coverage



For Europe's first double-GP weekend, people had come from near and far, from all over the continent and beyond, even from far away places like Japan and the United States. Friday kicked things off with Legacy!


Legacy lovers especially flocked to Birmingham for the opportunity to play with all the powerful pillars of the format, like Brainstorm, Force of Will, and Deathrite Shaman. Over the last few months, control-minded multicolor strategies with Leovold, Emissary of Trest had been on the rise, but so was Mono-Red Prison.
