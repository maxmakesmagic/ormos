#### Dissension: The Ravnica Cycle, Book III


*by Cory J. Herndon*
The Rakdos cultists bloody the streets with a viciousness matched only by the Boros angels’ attempts to eradicate them.As it is, the dead outnumber the living. The Guildpact is torn by dissension. And the guildmasters are under attack.


Lucky for Ravnica, on a world where ghosts linger, being dead isn’t half the excuse Kos would like it to be.


The final title in the exciting trilogy dealing with the new Magic: The Gathering expansion sets, Dissension gives players a sneak peek at the upcoming card releases.

*Far from the chaos caused by the attack on the Conclave years ago, the nearly abandoned Utvara district has become the unlikely epicenter of guild contention. Conflict between the area’s Gruul squatters and Orzhov titleholders masked a deeper truth: Relics lay under the Husk of Utvara, and Niv-Mizzet’s eldest magewrights desperately sought them...*
