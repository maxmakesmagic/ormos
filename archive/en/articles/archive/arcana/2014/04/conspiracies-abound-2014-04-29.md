This past weekend, Tokyo played host to the Niconico Chokaigi convention. **Magic** was there, and among the things we showed was a sneak peek at a new legendary creature in *Conspiracy*.


And since we showed him in Japanese at Niconico Chokaigi, here's your first look at Brago, King Eternal *in English*!

And for those who missed the roll out, we had a bit of a puzzle quest and social media hunt that slowly revealed the full Dack Fayden card for *Conspiracy*. Players were able to decode, puzzle crack, and figure out our hints as we slowly revealed Dack.

The truth is, *Conspiracy* doesn't hit shelves until June 6, 2014, so don't let this peek into the future distract you from the fact that *Journey into Nyx* hits shelves this Friday!
