Dougherty, fresh off his Top 16 finish in New Orleans looked to continue his hot streak.


Brad Swan dominated the die-roll metagame, rolling a 12-sided die to a wildly successful "12," while the die's owner, Rob Dougherty managed a meager "1." "Make sure you mention the die roll," joked Swan.
Okay Brad, I got it.


On his first turn, Swan got his [Peek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peek) on, and Rob showed mono-red with 4 Mountains, [Magma Vein](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Vein), [Ember Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast), and [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt). While Rob was casting an Ember Beast, Swan showed that he also is very good at another limited skill; drawing all three colors of mana on the first three turns.
Dougherty finally got his second color of mana, black, and began to build some card advantage by [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)ing his fallen Ember Beast.
Swan missed his fifth-turn land drop but showed excellent defense in the form of [Puppeteer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer) and [Blessed Orator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Orator), while [Repel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel)ling, and then Syncopating Rob's third Ember Beast.

After several uses of [Phanatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phanatog), Swan got to threshold; killed an Ember Beast with a [Patriarch's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) and cast a big [Dirty Wererat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat).
Swan finally drew a board-buster, [Cephalid Broker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Broker). Over the next few turns he rooted through his library and turned up [Morbid Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger), and plenty of control to win with his Wererat and a [Caustic Tar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Tar).


Swan 1 Dougherty 0


Swan once again dominated the mana draw with blue, white, and black mana in the first three turns, used [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) to kill Dougherty's Ember Beast and cast a [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill).
Rob didn't fear Swan's Standstill, and cast a [Famished Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famished+Ghoul) and gave Swan the three cards. With cards filling his hand, and what seemed like plenty of time, Swan started out with defense again with Blessed Orator, Puppeteer, and then a second Puppeteer on successive turns.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpatl01/961.jpg)*Brad Swan*Dougherty, down on cards, and threats, managed to deal with the Orator with a Firebolt and Patriarch's Desire, and Firebolt out of his graveyard made short work of a Puppeteer. After several land draws, the Bostonian Dougherty appeared to have some offense rolling with a Dirty Wererat on threshold.
Dougherty, now flanked with teammates David Humphreys and Chad Ellis, finally got to 9 mana to cast [Valley of Boulders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+of+Boulders), attempting to take out two of Swan's three creatures. 
Swan, being the tight player that he is, remembered the [Embolden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden) in his graveyard cast nearly 20 minutes ago, saved his creatures, and swung back to win on the following turn in extra time.


Final result; Brad Swan beat Rob Dougherty 2-0 to remain undefeated.
