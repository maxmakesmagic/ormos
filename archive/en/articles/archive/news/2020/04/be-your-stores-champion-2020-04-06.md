As we launch *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths*, we're also deploying important initiatives to support the Wizards Play Network store community.


We recognize that all over the world, game stores have had to restrict gatherings and find alternative ways to connect with their communities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.


To that end, today we have announced that Wizards of the Coast will provide [an allocation of *Mystery Boosters* to WPN stores equivalent to a retail value of up to $10 million dollars](https://wpn.wizards.com/en/article/lets-double-everyones-mystery-booster-allocation).


We also want to share other ways you can be your store's champion.

Consider Preordering *Ikoria* Now
=================================


Preordering is one of the best ways to champion your game store, so in addition to the Buy-a-Box promo, players who preorder *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* will receive a bonus code for items on *Magic: The Gathering* *Arena* from participating WPN retailers. The items are:


* A "Be Your Store's Champion" trophy pet
* A "Serra the Benevolent" avatar
* Manavault card sleeves

With many stores unable to hold Prerelease events as they normally would and in the interest of player health and safety, we have lifted restrictions to allow Prelease packs to be taken home. You may also consider preordering your Prerelease packs from your local store.


Please reach out to your local game store to confirm they are accepting preorders, that they are able to ship your order or offer curbside pickup, and that you can receive your code.


Stay Connected and Play Online
==============================


Many stores have created online communities, particularly on Discord, to connect them to their player base. To learn more about what your local game store might be doing right now, make sure to [connect with them online](https://locator.wizards.com/).


Once you've connected, make sure to share that online hub with your friends and fellow players. While we all adjust to gathering online, connections are going to depend on friends reaching out to friends.


And then—play! Local stores are running tournaments both over webcams and on *MTG Arena*. Even if they can't ship product, they may be able to hold events like this to continue a sense of community and keep your friends playing in fun events, even while stuck at home.


Thank You for Your Patience
===========================


We're working with our distributors and the WPN community to get products to everyone as soon as possible, but as we adjust to the realities of the COVID-19 situation around the world, know this will mean that some of you will get product sooner than others. We thank everyone for their understanding and their patience.
