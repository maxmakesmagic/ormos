***Legendary Cube* and *Commander (2015 Edition)* Known Issues**


**Gameplay**


* Cardset | [Caged Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caged+Sun)’s mana ability incorrectly doesn't trigger when a land is tapped for an ability that produces more than one mana.
* Cardset | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability.
* Cardset | All legendary creature cards in all zones owned by a player who controls a [Heroes' Podium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) incorrectly receive the power/toughness bonus from its first ability.
* Cardset | [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi)'s ability does not cause creature cards to be exiled instead of being put into the graveyard.
* Cardset | [Myriad Landscape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)’s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield.
* Cardset | [Kurkesh, Onakke Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurkesh%2C+Onakke+Ancient) does not copy activated abilities of artifacts that sacrifice as part of their activation cost.
