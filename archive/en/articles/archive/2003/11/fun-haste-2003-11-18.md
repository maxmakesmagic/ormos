Immunity to "summoning sickness" can mean more for your friendly neighborhood monster than just attacking immediately. It can also mean performing some neat tapping tricks on that turn, which could pay off for you, the tap-happy wizard, big-time.


Cards like [Battle Rampart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Rampart), [Reckless Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge), and more recently, [Dragon Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Breath), have granted haste before. But since *Mirrodin's*  **[Lightning Greaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves)** grant haste so conveniently and cheaply, some haste-a-licious creature combos suddenly became more appealing. Plus the Greaves' untargetability benefit protects your utility tapper from creature removal. Here's a list of a few (80+) creatures with cool tap abilities in the current Standard environment (*Onslaught* block, *Eighth Edition* and *Mirrodin*). Finding other combinations outside of Standard is left as an exercise for the reader. Happy deckbuilding!


* **[Anaba Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anaba+Shaman)** - Any classic "pinger" becomes quicker and deadlier when it comes down and fires on the same turn.
* **[Angelic Page](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Page)** - Tons of white creatures have offensive or defensive benefits via tapping.
* **[Aphetto Alchemist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Alchemist)** - The Alchemist can brew lots of trouble by untapping [Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) -- or any creature on this list.

![Arcanis the Omnipotent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent)
* **[Arcanis the Omnipotent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanis+the+Omnipotent)** - There's nothing worse than an Arcanis that doesn't get to give you cards before it dies. Why not build in a little insurance?
* **[Archivist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archivist)** - This library gopher gets a lot better at his job with untargetability and haste.
* **[Auriok Bladewarden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Bladewarden)**
* **[Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer)** - Your opponent doesn't want to see this mini-[Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Icy%2BManipulator) gain haste.
* **[Aven Redeemer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Redeemer)** - Four mana is a decent price for a flying double-[Samite Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite+Healer). It's even better when it starts protecting your board on turn 4 and is immune to [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock).
* **[Battlefield Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic)**
* **[Beacon of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destiny)**
* **[Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise)** - Improve your Birds' lifespan, and get your splash color out of it immediately! A hasted 1-mana mana creature pays for itself.
* **[Bloodline Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Shaman)** - A rapid-fire elf machine.
* **[Brown Ouphe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brown+Ouphe)** - Your opponent just dropped [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone). Protect your interests by responding with a hasty Ouphe.
* **[Cabal Interrogator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Interrogator)** - Black has utility tappers too!
* **[Callous Oppressor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Callous+Oppressor)** - A hasted Oppressor seems like an even cheaper [Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic).
* **[Canopy Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler)**
* **[Crafty Pathmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crafty+Pathmage)** - Hasted utility creatures become like sorceries that you can cast next turn for free.
* **[Crossbow Infantry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crossbow+Infantry)**
* **[Crypt Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Sliver)** - Slivers share around their abilities, so haste doesn't help as much. But Greaves can protect your first Crypt Sliver survive to regenerate.
* **[Daru Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Healer)**
* **[Daru Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger)** - What's better than hitting hard? Hitting hard and fast.
* **[Disruptive Pitmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disruptive+Pitmage)** - A face-down creature with Greaves on it is a scary thing.

* **[Dwarven Blastminer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Blastminer)** - With Greaves, he'll last until you have ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) to spend.

* **[Dwarven Demolition Team](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Demolition+Team)** - Dwarves with lightning boots on. Walls, be scared. Hey, they can't all be winners.
* **[Eastern Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eastern+Paladin)** - Mana costs in addition to tap requirements make the Paladins less scary. But still, it's a good trick for the late game.
* **[Elite Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Archers)**
* **[Elvish Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Aberration)** - With haste, he sort of costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)...

* **[Embermage Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin)**
* **[Everglove Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everglove+Courier)** - The Couriers all have pricey mana requirements on top of their tap cost, but don't count them out.

* **[Fyndhorn Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fyndhorn+Elder)** - Play out your hand in a hurry with hasted [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Birds%2Bof%2BParadise) and Elders.

* **[Goblin Dynamo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dynamo)** - The Greaves help this guy stick around for a turn more than let you activate him the same turn. Unless you have ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) lying around for your goblinball.

* **[Lumengrid Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Augur)** - It's already an engine by itself. All it has to do is live to pull off its trick, and the Greaves will ensure it does so.
