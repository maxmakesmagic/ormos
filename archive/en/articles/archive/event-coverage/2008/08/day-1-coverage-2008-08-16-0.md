Welcome to the country so nice, we had to name it twice... Call it The Netherlands or Holland, we don't really mind. It's not a very big country; we're only on our way to say hi to the 17th million Dutchman or woman, but right now we only have about 16 million and some. Still, we were able to have a bunch of Dutchies win some major tournaments in the history of our favorite game. We had two individual World Champions bringing home the Big Trophy, Tom v/d Logt (2001-2002 season) and Julien Nuijten (2004), and Julien also managed to win the Team Finals of 2006 with some help of Kamiel Cornelissen and Robert van Medevoort. Kamiel is best known for making back-to-back Pro Tour Finals in the 2000-2001 season and winning Pro Tour Seattle 2004 alongside Jelger Wiegersma and Jeroen Remie. Back in the days that European Championships were still organized, Noah Boeken (1999-2000 season) from Team ABU fame, was one of the past winners. Nowadays he's more involved in That Other Cardgame That Pays The Bigger Bills, but Noah has been spotted at the local Amsterdam Monday Evening Drafts preparing for this year's Nationals. More names that need to be dropped: Frank Karsten, one of the more popular former magicthegathering.com columnists, is going to attend even though he took sort of a break from Magic this year. He recently played GP Madrid and made 18th place, so that's not too bad. And of course Bram Snepvangers, the Nestor of Dutch Magic, known for his annual “Bramvitational” has shown up at Nationals conveniently organized in his hometown of Utrecht. Although mentioned before for winning PT Seattle, the most successful Dutchmen of this current season, Jelger Wiegersma, is not attending. He has, however, published a possible top-8 on the Dutch website KVDeckmasters. We'll start with some of the names he mentioned to give you an idea of who else might not have a name in Magic YET. Among Jelger's picks are Robert van Medevoort, Jeroen Remie and Kamiel Cornelissen as usual suspects, but he also mentioned Ziming Chen, Rens Feenstra, Kevin Grove, Paul Heynen and Friso Aalbers. Warriors of the local PTQ-scene and people that are always able to make top-8 in any Dutch Magic tournament are: Arjan van Leeuwen, Sven Dijt, Jasper Blaas, Roel van Heeswijk, Menno (“D”) Dolstra and Rogier Maaten.


Not playing myself at Dutch Nats this year because I was living in Luxembourg, I was able to help out a lot of players with testing and building their constructed deck. One of the things that struck me was that pretty much everyone is building some sort of version of Michael Jacobs MonoRed deck. Pretty much all the trading cards in my binder were changed into Magus of the Moon, Magus of the Scroll or Figure of Destiny. The people most capable of taking such a deck into the top-8 in my opinion are Peter v/d Brink (because he is also a very good drafter) and Jeroen Remie (because he is a guy that knows how to turn creatures sideways and beat you senseless).


Last but not least: The organization of the event is in the hands of the Dutch Organized Play Coordinator; Richard Drijvers, who is also the head judge for this event.


108 Players sat down about a minute ago, so I guess it's time to get started! Enjoy.

Feature Match Round 1: "I'm certainly gonna make mistakes here..." -Boeken vs Cornellison
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Erik van der Laan*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/Dutch-Nats-FM-r1-Boeken-Cornelissen-Photo-3-See-article------for-caption.jpg)Stijn's name should ring a bell – his brother Kamiel has made quite a name for himself with outstanding results over the years. Stijn is no slouch either and brings a mono-white Kithkin deck to the table. On the other side of the table is another name that should ring a bell: Noah Boeken was an accomplished Magic player, winning the European Championships among other big results, but then decided to try his luck at poker. Having been successful as well in that area of card play, he's now a ‘famous Dutchman' due to poker results and related television shows, and after feeling the itch to play those other cards at a high level again he received a special invite to compete. Noah tags a mono-red deck along he build himself but admitted not to have tested properly.


Noah rolls a 3 which Stijn trumps by the minimal amount – “Good luck” Noah responds to Stijn's 4 and the game is underway.


“I've never played a deck before where I still had to check my cards. Oh, you also still have to read what your cards do!” Stijn plays a Japanese Figure of Destine which is, of course, even more confusing. “Hmm, maybe that's in my deck too!” “I'm certainly gonna make mistakes here...” Noah adds, while playing a snow-covered mountain and passing.


Stijn attacks after laying a land, and tries to level his Figure. In response, Noah plays a Skred. “There you have it!” Stijn, of course, just levels his Figure again in response and still beats for 2. It seems Noah had an excellent read on his future plays - but not really the read he would have wanted!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/Dutch-Nats-FM-r1-Boeken-Cornelissen-photo-2-See-article------for-Caption.jpg)Noah lays down a second snow-covered mountain and passes. The Figure gets in for another 2 and Stijn goes spiritual with Spectral Procession. Noah, seemingly still taken aback by his early misplay, proceeds with another land-go play, taking 5 from Stijn's army who makes a Mutavault and Knight of Meadowgrain post-combat. Noah also goes spiritual with a Simian Spirit Guide removed to Sulfurous Blast his opponent's army away. He's still tracking behind 9-20 in life totals, but the board is clear.


A Figure of Destiny shows up for Noah, proving he's indeed in the deck, and Noah passes with two mana open. Stijn activates a Mutavault, then makes a Wizened Cenn which gets answered by a Skred on the Vault. Another Skred deals with the Cenn, clearing the way for Noah to level and attack with his Figure. With life totals now 7-12, Stijn rebuilds with a Wizened Cenn and a Spectral Procession. Noah still has ‘just' a 4/4 Figure, which gets chumped by a Spirit token. Stijn sends his team in for 4 damage, but the Cenn eats a Flame javelin. A Burrenton Forge Tender spells trouble for the poker player, and a Figure of destiny, which gets leveled immediately, adds insult to injury.


Noah sighs and stretches, knowing he's in some trouble here. Stijn sends his team in, Noah blocks Stijn's Figure with his Figure and Stijn tries to level, but Noah tries another Flame Javelin, wary of the Forge Tender in play. Stijn lets it resolve though, seeing as Noah has just 2 life left. Noah looks at his top card and finds nothing to help him out.


“Maybe if I had played right, you still would've won. But I dunno...oh well.”


Boeken - Cornelissen 0-1


Game 2


Both players keep and Noah starts with a Keldon Megaliths, while Stijn again has a Figure played off a Rustic Clachan. Noah lays a land, passing the turn sighing. Playing weak while strong? He actually was, Incinerating Stijn's Figure when he tried to level him up. Stijn has a Stalwart, but Noah one-ups that with an Ashenmoor Gouger, looking to whittle Stijn's life total down quickly. Stijn plays a Cenn though which makes the Stalwart almost as big as the Gouger and bringing the total damage output to 5. Noah untaps calmly and just lays down a second Gouger, turning the speed of the race up a notch.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/Dutch-Nats-FM-r1-Boeken-Cornelissen-photo-1-See-article------for-caption.jpg)The first attack for 8 comes from Stijn, with a Mutavault, Stalwart and Cenn coming in. Life totals are 16 to 9 in Stijn's advantage. After a long think, Noah actually decides to attack with his Gougers, then thinks again. With a Burrenton Forge Tender on the other side on the field played last turn, he's dead on the board, and is probably dead anyway even if he can take out the little kithkin that could. He plays a land and passes with 5 red open. Are we going to have a Blast? Stijn plays another Wizened Cenn which Noah certainly didn't like to see, and he indeed Blasts in response, but to no avail. The Forge Tender gets sacrificed and Stijn can attack for the win.


Boeken – Cornelissen 0-2


Afterwards, the players discuss whether Noah would have won if he didn't misplay. Stijn admitted to not having much more left when he won, but since the Kithkin deck can generate an army out of nowhere, that may not say much. Boeken thinks he should have been able to win the matchup, especially with his sided in Sulfur Elementals, which didn't showed up until Noah peeked at his top card after he scooped up game 2.


  
  


Friday, 11:00 a.m.: Round 1: Wessel Oomens vs Kamiel Cornelissen
----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Eelco van Ruth*

Game 1:  

Round one started about a second ago and we're sitting down with two of the biggest Dutch players around: Kamiel Cornelissen and Wessel Oomens. I had no clue Wessel was actually going to be here today and about Kamiel already enough has been said in the intro. But Wessel is used to winning as well, claiming a bunch of GP top-8's and winning 1. Kamiel has the edge, winning 2 and making top-8 in about 5. First turn play for Wessel is the [Tattermunge Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac) and Kamiel answers with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), making Wes reveal a lot of red spells. [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) needs to be discarded.


In Kamiel's second turn it is clear that he plays some sort of Token deck, because the [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal)l comes into play and brings a friend. Nantuku Husk is next. Wessel has no turn 3 play and only has [Stigma Lasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stigma+Lasher) from his turn 2 and also end of Kamiel's turn there's no play. [Flame Jab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Jab) and a discarded mountain takes care of two of Kamiel's tokens and the Husk is alone again. When Kamiel tries to join the Husk up with [Shadow Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Guildmage), the Husk has to bite a Shock. In Kamiel's 5th turn [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls) tries to revive the [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal). Only the Mogg and the Guildmage enter the redzone. Wessel tries to help Kamiel pointing out that the other token can also attack, but Kamiel claims that the token enters play after the Torrent resolves. About Kamiel's 5th turn [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) Wes has to say: "I hope I play that card too..."


Wessel stays on 3 lands, but the [Ashenmoor Gouger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger) doesn't need more. Kamiel responds with [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). Lifetotals are 15-8 in Wessels favor. The [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) tokens that Kamiel plays are Kamiel Cornelissen Pro Player cards and the last remaining Goblin Token is a Jelger Wiegersma; nice touch.


Time to review the board: Wessel has Gouger, [Stigma Lasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stigma+Lasher) and Mogg Fanatic and Kamiel has [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) and one lonely Faerie token after Wessel sends all his guys in. On Wessel's side only the [Stigma Lasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stigma+Lasher) dies. Kamiel's next play is [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon), but Wessel sacrifices his Mogg Fanatic end of turn and plays [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast). Kamiel would have gone to 2, not dead yet, but he scoops them up anyway.


When asked about their preparation for this tournament Wes' story is that he stayed up till 3am this morning and had some people take care of the hardcore testing. Kamiel questions the people Wessel had working for him this year, because he heard that Wessel has Karplusan Wolverine and Karplusan Yeti in the board. Also it's mentioned that Wessel is not playing any snow-covered mountains. Kamiel has to come clean though: his testing was not too eventful either.


Game 2: Both players keep their hand and Wessel starts his turn 1 with Martyr of Ashes. Kamiel's turn 2 play is [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). Tokens enter play with [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal)l for Wes and he clearly has the edge with a Bram Snepvangers Pro Player Card. Terror from Kamiel means that Wessel doesn't have to worry about any upkeep effects. Kamiel has a [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal) on his side of the table but he gets [Disintegrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disintegrate)d for 1. Kamiel's next turn is another enchantment: Grave Pact. And with that he pretty much owns the board. After a Nantuku Husk also enters play, the game is over very fast. After that second game Wessel reveals his deck: it's a Monored Highlander deck, apparently... Frank Karsten plays the same deck "with a lot less one-offs". It's good to see that everyone at least has a lot of fun.


Game 3: Wessel is very happy about his opening hand and he receives approval from Frank Karsten. Kamiel has to mulligan. At the end of turn 2, Wessel makes it clear that he means business, because a [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) was suspended on turn 1 and [Keldon Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders) is ready to deal a lot of damage. The Mogg Fanatic on Kamiel's side is not getting any help in his turn 3, but a [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) will make sure that Wes' [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage) won't be able to attack without losing either the Mage or his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). The [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) eventually gets killed and another mountain is added to the board on Wessel's side. Kamiel's 5th turn play is a little bit more impressive: [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter). Wessel is at a healthy 20 and Kamiel only at 13, so the race is on. Wessel takes a long time to think about his next play and doesn't seem too happy about the [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter). When the Mage attacks and Kamiel blocks with the Flitter and 1 token, a Incinerate takes care of the potential 3/3. A [Flame Jab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Jab) takes care of the last token, but Kamiel simply builds another [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter), effectively presenting Wessel with the same board again. When Wessel passes the turn, it's clear that he doesn't have another Incinerate and [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter) plus the 1 of the 2 Goblin Rogue tokens enter the red zone. A Mogg Fanatic is added to Kamiel's side of the board. Another one of Wessel's one-offs is [Thick-Skinned Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thick-Skinned+Goblin). With his ability to give himself Protection from Red, it might be a nice creature to start a race with Kamiel on 13 and Wes on 17. When Wessel tries to attack with his 2/1 giving it Protection from Red after asking Kamiel if he has any red potential blockers, Kamiel asks a judge if he is obliged to answer that question with an honest answer. The [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter) creates black goblins, but Wessel mistakes the Pro Player Cards (which are red) for red creatures, but of course, they are not. This halts Wessel's plans to attack for 2. [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter) gets in for 2 and a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) is added. When Wessel's Gargadon finally enters play and wants to attack, a Terror makes an end to that gameplan. The new gameplan for Wessel seems to be [Flame Jab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Jab)bing [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) tokens and attack for 2 with the [Thick-Skinned Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thick-Skinned+Goblin). He is able to get Kamiel down to 4 and in pretty much his last turn he will be able to do that with the help of [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out). Kamiel surprises everyone watching the match with allowing the [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out) to resolve while 2 Mogg Fanatics could be able to prevent the [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out) to resolve. The clash is won by Kamiel though, and Wessel is mindtricked into scooping, even though Wessel was still at a healthy 7 live with only 4 creatures on Kamiel's side of the table. Wessel explains to the audience that if Kamiel says that you're dead, you're dead. It also helped a little that Kamiel still had a [Sudden Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Death) in his hand, but Noah Boeken was not satisfied with the outcome of the match: "You can't even win the Clash, man ! You're hopeless..."


Kamiel wins 2-1.


Frankie Karsten explains Wessel's deck choice, clearly identifying himself as one of Wessel's test-staff. "The amount of cards that you're able to play in Standard is enormous at the moment, so the idea is to play as much different spells as possible to allow opponents to guess exactly what they're up against. Even though Wessel is playing a Highlander Deck, there is not a single bad card in it." Wessel has to interrupt Frank for a second with the words "Karplusan Wolverine ?!" and when I ask him if he is playing the deck too, he says "Nah...".




Friday, 12:50 p.m.: Round 2 Feature Match Adri v. Binsbergen vs. Dimitri Reinderman
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Henry van den Brink*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/r2.jpg)*Adri (left) and Dimitri (right) battle it out.*Adri made top 8 in the dutch nationals last year, but this year he had a false start, losing his best matchup in round 1 (Kithkin). Dimitri is a professional chess player, and he played in a few pro tours, the most recent one being San Diego. Dimitri played against Roel van Heeswijk's [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) deck in round 1, and also lost. The loser of this round will have a hard time making top 8, so a bit of pressure is on this match already.


Both players started with mulligans, Adri taking two of them, Dimitri only one. Dimitri took the first one together with Adri, wondering if the new mulligan rule was already active. Adri started out with plains and fetid heath, while dimitri made a figure of destiny which grew on the first attack. He then passed and Adri passed back after playing a third land. Figure grew again to 4/4 and Adri dropped to 14. Adri played a land and passed again. When the figure attacked, pollen lullaby was played by adri. The clash revealed spiteful vision from Adri and keldon marauders from Dimitri. [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) joined Dimitri's team, and Adri played the spiteful vision he revealed with pollen lullaby. An end of turn incinerate dropped Adri to 11, and mutavault and tarmogoyf crashed in. Holy day from Adri prevented damage. Keldon marauders took him to 10, vision to 8. [Runed Halo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo) on spiteful vision from Adri prevented him from getting damaged any further. The team attacked and Adri played batwing brume, taking Dimitri down to 10. Martyr of sands seemed to be a good answer to Dimitri's team, and Adri seemed to be taking control of this game. [Flame Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) dropped him to 10 after saccing martyr, revealing another brume and a dawn charm. Keldon marauders died, and Adri went to 9. Goyf attacked, and the brume took Dimi to 7. [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) was suspended and the turn was passed. Wrath of god solifiIed Adri's position but some burn in Dimitri's solid grip of 6 could end the game even through dawn charm this turn. Incinerate resolved, mutavault attacked and 2 tarfires ended the game.


### Game 2


Adri sideboarded nothing, this probably being a favourable matchup for him. Dimitri sided 3 cards. No mulligans this time. Adri started the same as game 1, plains and fetid heath. Dimitri played mogg fanatic and attacked for 2 on turn 2 with the help of pendelhaven. A second mogg fanatic was played. Adri got stuck on 2 landsnot so good against an aggressive red-green deck. Brume came from Adri and Dimi suspended a bolt and passed. A third land for Adri came. Incinerate and rift bolt took Adri to 12 and pollen lullaby came on the attack. Post combat Dimitri rift bolted Adri, who went down to 9. Adri wrathed, going to 7 by suicidal goblins. Dimi played draw-go, and so did Adri. This happened once more, neither player's draw seemed to be very great. Dimi played Kavu predator with a grove of the burnwillows in play and Adri wrathed again. Draw-go from Dimitri again, and Adri played martyr of sands. No play from Dimitri again. Adri extirpated incinerate and Dimi showed 2 lands and shard volley in his hand. Martyr also suicided and Adri gained 12 life, going to 19, revealing brume, dawn charm, wrath and runed halo. This does not look good for our chess professional. [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) was played and redzoned the next turn but apparently friday is a holy day. Tarmo attacked again next turn, and Adri went to 16. Adri played howling mine. [Flame Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) at end of turn took Adri to 12. Tarmo kept attacking, but this time the brume prevented the damage. Marauders joined the team and adri went to 11. Wrath cleared the board and Adri passed. Adri asked to nobody in particular for some more combo pieces. Dimitri played rift bolt, which got dawn charmed, then another goyf. The draw step made Adri “blugh”. He then played runed halo, naming tarmogoyf, after some discussion about whether he drew 2 cards or only one. Adri played spiteful vision, and it became clear why he blughed. He wanted to play runed halo on goyf, but then had to think when he drew vision. Goyf and mutavault attacked Adri to 8, and he would go to 6 after his draw step against Dimi's full grip.Keldon marauders dropped him to 7 and Adri was getting very close to getting burned out. Shard volley came from Dimitri and Adri asked for some more burn to end the game. Dimitri only had tarfire, which got dawn charmed, but after drawing his cards, Adri could only concede, revealing a hand of four lands.


Dimitri wins 2-0




Round 2 Feature Match - Frank Karsten vs Kamiel Cornelissen
-----------------------------------------------------------


*by Jasper Bongaards*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/r2fk.jpg) Frank starts the round with a turn 1 figure of Destiny. Kamiel plays a first turn swamp but has no play. Therefore Frank can enlarge his figure of destiny to a 2/2 and deal the first two damage. Kamiel plays a turn 2 [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) with a mountain. A turn 3 ashenmour gouger adds power to the board for Frank, Kamiel's response is a turn 3 magus of the moon. On turn 4 Frank casts a Mogg Fanatic to kill Kamiel (a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) token) and attacks with figure of destiny and [Ashenmoor Gouger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger). Kamiel blocks the Gouger and Frank increases the [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) to a 4/4 to deal 4 damage. Kamiel is now at 11 life. The next turn he casts a Mogg war marshall to create some extra blockers. Frank adds a pair of [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight)s to keep the pressure on Kamiel. Kamiel is still in defence mode and when he reached five mana he cast a torrent of souls to get back his mogg war marshall, and attacks Frank to 14 with a pair of [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) tokens. On Frank's turn he thinks for a while and decides to attack with all of his creatures, Kamiel chooses to block with his tokens. That attack put Kamiel on 7 life, and with 2 Incinerates after combat Frank takes the first game. The [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) would kill Kamiel during his upkeep.


Frank 1 - Kamiel 0


While Frank is sideboarding, he admits that Wessel Oomens isn't the only one with a sideboard toolbox'. Most of his one ofs are no good for this matchup though, so only a [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) and two [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast)s replace the 3 [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon). Kamiel is better prepared with his sideboard for this match, as 9 cards come into his maindeck. Terror, [Sudden Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Death) and Grave Pact will offer a good amount of removal.


Game 2:


Kamiel quickly says keep and after some thoughts Frank decides to keep as well. Kamiel has a first turn play with Mogg Fanatic, Frank decides to Skred the creature on his turn, dropping to 19. Kamiel seems to be the agressor in this match, leading with a turn 2 Mogg war marshall, which is also echoed. A turn 2 keldon megaliths means no play for Frank, but on turn 3 he incinerates a freshly cast [Shadow Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Guildmage) of Kamiel. [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) also joins the board for Frank. Turn 4 means trouble for Frank as Kamiel plays a Grave Pact. With a Mogg war marshall and a token Kamiel decides to attack with a token. This brings Frank to 16 life. On turn 5 Kamiel plays a Nantuko Husk to give him sacrifice outlets to trigger the grave pact. No attack on this turn only means Frank can increase his 1/1 [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) to a 4/4 creature. With 5 mana untapped Frank thinks for a while and passes the turn. Terror on the [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) means there are no blockers for Frank and Kamiel attacks with his team of Nantuko Husk, [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal)l and a 1/1 goblin token. A Skred is going to deal 4 damage to the Husk, so Kamiel tries to save his Husk by sacrificing his two creatures. Another burn spell, [Flame Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin), kills the Husk though and no damage is dealt. A [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) for Frank means a five power flyer for Frank and attacks Kamiel to 15. Frank is still on 16 life. Kamiel takes his turn and casts a torrent of souls, which gets back a mogg war marshall. With the bonus of the torrent, Kamiel attacks Frank for 6 to take him to 10 life. By not paying the echo for Mogg war marshall, the Demigod also goes to the graveyard and Kamiel attacks frank to a mere 7 life. Frank decides to clear the board with an instant sulfurous blast. The life totals are Kamiel 8 against Franks 5. Frank has 2 Keldon Megalith's though, so there is a clock for Kamiel. Marsh flitter comes into play for Kamiel, but before any token hits the board Frank kills it with [Keldon Megaliths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Megaliths). And for the next turn the other tokens get killed as well. Frank looks at his next card and admits he has a pretty good draw. Another Demogid of Revenge retrieves the one in the graveyard and kills Kamiel with 10 flying damage.


Frank 2 – Kamiel 0




Round 3 Feature Match - Tom van de Logt vs Sweitse van Leeuwen
--------------------------------------------------------------


*by Eelco van Ruth*

Tom van de Logt is best know for the fact that he made top-8 at Worlds twice, winning the whole thing in Toronto. Sweitse is more worried that a feature match will spoil his tech to the rest of the field. Don't worry Sweitse: no one will pay too much attention to words written on MagictheGathering.com, right ? That's a joke, of course...


Tom starts out with some damage from Adarkar Wastes and suspends an [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s while our photographer takes everyone's picture. A second AV is suspended while Sweitse also plays blue lands (islands), but only makes a [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens). We are bracing ourselves for a control mirror, but Sweitse makes another Lens and suspends a [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon), making Tom even less sure about what he's up against. The first Ancestral makes Tom discard a Story Circle while Sweitse makes an evoked [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). Before it actually leaves play, the Gargadon eats it. The second Ancestral Tom wants to resolve walks into a Rune Snag. The Rune Snag prevents the AV from resolving but Tom makes a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) with the help of [Mystic Gate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Gate). His board has a lot of blue and white lands plus an [Urza's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Factory). When Sweitse tries to cast a [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), Tom plays the second Rune Snag of the game. Finks swings for 3 and Sweitse's next turn is full of action: first a [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) resolves, netting another 2 cards, and secondly an [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) sticks to the board. When Tom passes the turn without even playing a land, Sweitse tries to semi-combo by playing a [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double). The spell is countered by [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and his next play, another [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), is Rune Snagged. Meanwhile, Sweitzes hand is emptying up a little, while Tom makes [Sacred Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa). Tom's next couple of turns are not too eventful, because his next turn consists of suspending his 3rd [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s and wait for Sweitse's next attack step. The tokens he will be able to build will be more then enough to hold of even the Gargadon, should it be able to resolve at one point. The Pegasus tokens and the [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) trade with a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and the [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) and as a result the Gargadon finally makes an entrance. The [Sacred Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa) is not too impressed and this reported decides to simply sit back and enjoy an Ice Tea, because this will go on for quite a while I'm afraid. A couple of turns go by and Tom's first real creature he builds is an [Archon of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice). The Archon chumps the Gargadon, but Sweitse plays a [Momentary Blink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) to save the Gargadon. Tom shrugs it off and just makes another [Archon of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice). Both the Archon and 1 of the Pegasus tokens finally attack Sweitse and the life totals are 12 to 15 in Tom's favor after an attack from Sweitse with [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault); the Gargadon was of course blocked by a token. When Tom starts attacking with the Archon and 3 tokens, the game begins to slip away from Sweitse. He is sitting on his Blink in the graveyard and another one in his hand. He also has a Wrath of God, but he chooses not to play it, because it's kind of useless against an active [Sacred Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa). When it's clear that Tom will not forget to pay the upkeep of the annoying enchantment, he scoops up his cards.


While sideboarding, Sweitse shows me his set of [Sacred Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa)‘s. He's not sure whether to board them in or not, but when I would be able to help him with that I would have to say that Tom recently won a game using Pegasi or whatever more then 1 Pegasus is called.


In the meantime we learn that Victor van der Broek (the longtime teammate of Frank Karsten and Jelger Wiegersma from back in the days) made it to 3-0 with his Monored deck. Even though the rounds are 60 minutes he was able to finish every game early and clearly enjoys talking to different reporters and Level-5 judge Jaap Brouwer, who just came to Utrecht to support the judgestaff and help out a little. He is not wearing his zebra t-shirt. When asked how he came up with the deck, he simply replies with “Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V...”.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/r3.jpg)Game 2:


Tom has the best possible start again: [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s. Sweitse builds a Mind Stone in his game 2. When Tom suspends another AV, Sweitse lets go of a little laugh and knows that resolving a lot of [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter)s will not be enough. In Sweitse's turn 4 already 3 artifacts are on the table: 2 Mind Stones and 1 [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens). He uses his mana to play a [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) and Tom spends a Wrath of God on it to get rid of it. A [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) takes his place transforming into the previously played [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) and next Tom makes a nice mistake. He tries another Wrath of God, but when the [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) leaves play as a [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) he finds himself (now as a [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double)) and comes straight back into play. Tom is not too pleased with that play, but makes his 7th manasource and an [Archon of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice). Sweitse only has [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)s in hand, so the Archon sticks. When the [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) attempts to attack in the next turn, Tom wonders if he can block the copied [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), have the [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) return and then remove it with the leave-play ability from the Archon. That's not possible, of course, so the [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) hits for 3, making the lifetotals 19-10 in Sweitse's favor. A [Bonded Fetch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) is added to the board. Tom plays his 8th manasource and makes his second Coldsteel Heart, not doing too much else. Sweitse trades one of his Mind Stones for an extra card. In the next attack, Tom falls to 6 but Sweitse is presented with a nice dilemma when end of turn [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir) enters play. When it resolves, Tom has immunity from countermagic and resolves a [Sacred Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa). The Archon is not afraid to attack anymore and hits Sweitse to 15. Tom passes the turn with Teferi and [Sacred Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa) in play with 7 lands untapped. He feels pretty secure, but Sweitse shows the reporter a topdecked [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon). With the [Bonded Fetch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) and the [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) in play and only 10 minutes in the round, this is probably the last game we'll be witnessing: Sweitse will be able to sacrifice his team, draw his whole deck with [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter)s from [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double)/[Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) leave-play effects, discard a [Venser, Shaper Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant) with the [Bonded Fetch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) somewhere in between all this action and bounce Tom's board. Tom chooses not to await all that and scoops. With 5 minutes left in the round, we start with game 3.


Game 3:


Tom doesn't have [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s but has 5 mana in his 4th turn, thanks to Coldsteel Heart. When Sweitse plays an end of turn [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), it's met by a Rune Snag. When Sweitse uses his freedom to evoke a [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) and suspend a Gargadon, Tom makes a mainphase Teferi and attacks for 3. When Tom also gets the chance to simply untap and drop his 8th manasource, things are not looking too positive for Sweitse. Another evoked [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), the 3rd in the game, allows Sweitse to have an incredible amount of cards in his hand, but another Clique gets Rune Snagged. Tom adds an [Archon of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice) to the board and starts attacking for 7 now: and all Sweitse can do is attempt to play a [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), but it's met with a [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). The last play of the game is Sweitse attempting a [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) for the win, but Tom flashes a [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation). Since Teferi makes sure that Sweitse can't play any of his counter magic, Tom van de Logt wins 2-1.


Sweitse's deck appears to be fine-tuned to face Monored decks today, so there was no [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation)s in the maindeck. Tom is proud to mention that he made up his own deck and hasn't lost a match yet. He drew his first round though, so he will be at 7 points going into the booster draft portion of this tournament. Sweitse will still be at a healthy 6 points and maybe these two players will meet in their first draft pod.




Top 8 Predictions
-----------------


*by Henry van den Brink*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/top8pred.jpg)Bram Snepvangers:  

Frank Karsten, Robert van Medevoort and myself! I should be confident about my own chances.


Adriaan Schipper:  

Robert van Medevoort for sure, Rens Feenstra because I playtested with him and Roel van Heeswijk.


Rens Feenstra:  

Robert van Medevoort, Frank Karsten, and myself.


Frank Karsten:  

Robert van Medevoort, Wessel Oomens (who is playing a highlander red deck ), and I can't really think of a third person to name, it could be any longtime player. Myself, Bram, Roel, Ruud, the list goes on...




I can dodge Bullets!
--------------------


*by Jasper Bongaards*

In round 2 Job Meertens was playing against Peter Kesteloo, with an interesting matchup between [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) (Job) and the well known Stormdeck (Peter). The game was going pretty good for Peter, as he could deal a lot of damage with [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) and sets Job to a mere 2 life. After this, he drew some cards and he waited untill he could go off again. He was able to go off for 5 with a [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories). Unfortunately for Job he had only 3 cards, of which 2 would kill him when just a single copy of the spell would hit that card. Amazingly, Peter hits his land 5 times in a row, so he is still alive. And of course, after thislucky clash he carries on to win the game and the match. The chances of Job still being alive after the [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories), are 0,33 \* 0,33 \* 0,33 \* 0,33 \* 0,33 = 0.0039, so that is a chance of 0,39%. After this match, Peter threw away the unlucky die which he used to determine the card for [Ignite Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories).




Feature Match Round 3: I have a dream - Karsten vs Heynan
---------------------------------------------------------


*by Erik van der Laan*

Frank had a dream last night: Paul Heynen would end up second place in this tournament, with Bram Snepvangers and Danny de Rooij joining him on the team. He even dreamed of the deck that Paul's actually playing! Paul certainly hopes it comes true but sadly had no dreams of Frank. Paul wins the die roll, but frowns at his opening hand. He still keeps and opens with a Birds of Paradise which gets Skredded. Paul is stuck on two lands which elicits an "Ah, so I made a good decision on the skred!" from Frank. Paul has a Llanowar elves on the next turn which gets Incinerated. [Profane Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command) for 1 returns the Birds of Paradise, but Frank already has a [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) and an [Ashenmoor Gouger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger) running in for 8 damage, and even has an answer left for the Birds by virtue of a Mogg Fanatic. With his mana being denied to him and Frank's creatures steadily eating away at his life total, Paul decides to go for game 2.![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/Dutch-Nats-FM-r3-Karsten-vs-Heynen-Photo-1.jpg) Karsten - Heynen 1-0 A discussion ensues between games about playing Mogg Fanatic whereas Paul believes [Magus of the Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll) was in the original list of Shuhei Nakamura. Frank points out that the Fanatics were in the original as well, but that the Figures had to be added. These games the Fanatics are very effective at keeping Paul's mana acceleration offline. Game 2 Both players keep and both players decide on a first turn tapped land - [Keldon Megaliths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Megaliths) and Treetop Village. Paul gets him a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) turn 2 while Frank plays a [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight), which comes in for 2 the next turn. Paul plays a Llanowar Elves who surprisingly survive, but Frank does have a [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) to cripple Paul's land base of dual Treetop villages and a [Gilt-Leaf Palace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilt-Leaf+Palace). Paul has the [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap), but almost reconsidered the play, thinking he would miss the second black mana. Frank just lays down another [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) and keeps beating with his [Blood Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight), taking Paul down to 13, while Frank is still on 19. With only black and red mana available through his lands, Paul uses his Llanowar Elves to spawn a Birds of Paradise, hoping to finally get access to the right mana again. "I'll just reside in the tank for a while." Eventually, Frank decides to Skred the Redcap with his last mana at the end of Paul's turn, then attacks with his two red men. The Redcap and a Faerie token double block the Magus, the token gets Incinerated so the Magus survives to wreck Paul's land base some more. This wasn't all bad for Paul though, as he had the [Profane Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command) to revive the Redcap and shoot the Magus. Frank unleashes a Demigod, which gets blocked by a lowly - but sufficient - Faerie token. Because of the relentless attacks on both sides, the life totals are close to lethal now, with both players standing at 9 after Paul went in with his team mainly consisting of Faerie tokens. Paul manages to take the game away with a [Primal Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Command), healing 7 life and searching for [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) which immediately gets played. "I don't think I can work this out anymore..." Frank thinks a little more then concedes the game. Karsten - Heynen 1-1 Game 3 For the third game, Karsten spends some time thinking about how to sidedeck. Apparently, his dream didn't tell him how to side against Heynen's black-green deck! Paul takes a mulligan while Frank keeps. Frank has no 1-drop, and a Bords of Paradise from Paul seems to survive - until Frank just Incinerates it on the second turn. Paul follows up with a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), again on his second turn. The Faerie token it gives blocks an incoming [Ashenmoor Gouger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger). [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) bring Paul's life back to 20, but a Demigod from Frank looks to bring that down quickly again. After some thinking, Frank decides to leave the Gouger behind and just attack with the Demigod. Paul brings his own big man into play, a [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus), and passes. The Demigod eats another faerie token and a second Gouger joins the team alongside a [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon). Paul plays a land and passes, quite suspicious with 6 lands untapped. But Frank may very well have the upper hand any way, Skredding the Colossus (Paul only has 1 forest, thus unable to pump the Shapshifter) and adding another Demigod, attacking with all his big red men. There's another inactive turn from Paul, whose deck seems to have failed in giving him any goodies after his mulligan, and a consequent attack from Frank brings the scoop from Paul. Frank may have had a dream, but he has done well in preventing it to come true, at least insofar he could influence Paul's result! Frank Karsten wins 2-1 from Paul Heynen and begins the draft with a 3-0 record.




Round 4 Feature Match: Roel van Heeswijk vs. Frank Roelofs
----------------------------------------------------------


*by Jasper Bongaards*

Both players are now at 2-1 and a win is very much needed for a pretty good day 1 record. A very exciting match of Rock, Paper Scissors would determine who can start this match. After 4 clashes Frank wins the fifth one and chooses to start. Roel is kind of scared about his hand, but apparently he forgot that he is playing limited now.  

But gladly he realised in time before he thought about mulliganning and he gladly kept his 7. Frank mulliganned to 6.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/r4frank.jpg)The match starts with Frank laying down [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and 2 islands. Roel starts with plains, ancient amphitheater and a forest. Roel's first play of the match is an [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe). On turn 4 Roel plays a [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling) and asks whether the Axe will equip the  

Changeling, but Roel declines.  

Roel on his turn casts a [Fertile Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and a Battlewand oak, and surprisingly notices the [Battlewand Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak) is also a Warrior and can attack with a hasty Oak. Frank goes into defence mode with a [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero). The next turn Roel casts a [Game-Trail Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Game-Trail+Changeling) and equips with the Axe. Together with a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) the [Battlewand Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak) is 5/7 and both creatures go into the red zone to bring Frank to 7.  

Frank reinforces the changeling hero and attacks back for 6. The life totals are Roel 12 vs. Franks 13.  

Roel casts an [Inner-Flame Igniter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner-Flame+Igniter), and the Battle Axe immediately jumps onto it. Together with an activation from the Igniter Roel attacks back for 12 damage and puts Frank to a mere 1 life. Frank attacks with the [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero) to get Roel to 6 and with  

this attack he will go up to 7. He casts a [Mind Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Spring) after combat in search for answers. The two cards he drew were not what he was looking for and he could only play a [Stonybrook Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Banneret). With more than enough damage on the board Roel get's all his men  

into the red zone and that leads to the first game.


Roel 1 - Frank 0


Frank sees a hand with only white creatures and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s and quickly mulligans to 6. They both keep their hands. A turn 2 [Stonybrook Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Banneret) starts the game for Frank, while Roel casts a [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling). On turn 3 Frank misses his land drop, but with the  

help of the Banneret he can cast a [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling) for 2 mana. Last game's all-star comes in on turn 3 for Roel, as he casts [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe) again.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/r4roel.jpg)Frank attacks Roel with the Banneret and the [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling) and takes Roel to 17. With 3 mana untapped he passes the turn. Roel wonders whether Frank has a counter and sees one with [Battlewand Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak). Frank counter his Treefolk Warrior with [Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions). Roel attacks with [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling) again and Frank falls to 16. Frank is putting up the pressure by attacking with his Banneret and [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling) and adds a [Burrenton Bombardier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Bombardier) to his board.  

Roel casts a [Ambassador Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Oak) and equips it with the battle axe. He attacks for 7 and Frank goes to 9 life. [Consuming Bonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consuming+Bonfire) on the [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling) means it will die and Roel gets through 2 damage in his attack phase after a chump block from Frank. Frank adds another Bombardiers to the board and goes on defence mode.  

Roel, however, hits his 7th land and slams a Oakgnall Warrior on the table. A hasty 7/8 Treefolk Warrior with trample joins the attack with 3 other creatures and Frank extends the hand to Roel


Roel 2 - Frank 0




Friday, 18:00 :Judges and the WPN
---------------------------------


*by Eelco van Ruth*

Judges are always left out of the coverage. You sometimes see a group picture of a herd of zebras at Premier Events, or a statement posted when the Head Judge of such a tournaments wants to tell a little bit more about strange interactions of new cards or DQ's. That's a shame, because these are exciting times for judges and Tournament Organizers around the world. The Wizards Player Network has been in effect for a couple of weeks now !  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/Judges1.jpg) Basically it means that everyone (not just judges or TO's !) are able to add a lot of benefits to the tournaments they organize: from extra DCI Promo Foils in the Gateway Program to the ability to bring (Pre) Release Events to their venues and their players to enjoy them. The WPN can help out in making your local tournament or casual experience a better one then before. Judges are usually the first people to pick up those new possibilities and make everyone's Magic experience even better then before. I'm going to ask a couple of judges active here at Dutch Nationals about their plans to use the WPN to their own, and their player's benefit.  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/Judges2.jpg)  

To make this specific part of the coverage a little bit more interesting for people that are JUST interested in cool plays or strange rules questions, I will also ask the judges I'm interviewing if they ran into cool rules interactions that came up in the first 3 rounds of Standard play.


The first person I'm walking into is Level-5 judge Jaap Brouwer and I'm pretty sure that he will not be too active in the WPN Program. In his local scene he's more involved as a casual player, as judge he's more involved on international scene and policy level. In the past (1995) Jaap setup a tournament scene in the east of the Netherlands and he's kind of jealous at what WPN offers nowadays to support local or Premier TO's. "It's easy now to start building a new scene or support an existing one. What happened to the old fashioned ‘discover it yourself' way"?.  

In his opinion the only way to generate more people playing Magic is to stimulate and enable volunteers to organize tournaments in their own environment. Local TO's should have access to the tools they need to support their area. Players shouldn't have to drive 50 miles to play a fun and low profile game. Only then there will be more first-time players that eventually qualify for Regionals and in the end might pick up a slot for the next Pro Tour. But it all starts at the base: the local drafts in community centers, the Friday Night Magic tournaments in the Game Shop at the corner of the street or the Pre Release tournament where everyone, Pro or Scrub, will show up and have fun.  

Jaap has not been involved yet in any interesting rules problems. He wants to mention though, that for this weekend's tournament the judge staff has been asked to approach this day and every situation they might encounter with a smile on their face. The idea is to try and generate a relaxed atmosphere for both the staff and participants of this tournament.  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/Judges3.jpg)  

Richard Drijvers is the Head Judge for this episode of Dutch Nationals and of course he has very warm feelings about the WPN; he is also the Organized Play/Country Coordinator for the Netherlands. My first question is: have local judges and TO's in Holland embraced the Network already ?


Of course, is his answer, because local TO's are now able to set up their own Premier Events, and pretty much organize everything except for PTQ's. One other important element of the WPN: Friday Night Magic tournaments are no longer ONLY available to shops or gaming centers. Everyone who is willing to join the WPN can organize an FNM!  
  

Edwin van Eijk and Jurgen Baert (from Belgium) have positive feelings about the WPN, but they won't have too much to do with it: they both are active in regions where game shop owners are already very active. Only Pre Release tournaments will probably be organized by Edwin because the shop might be too small, but in Jurgen's territory the Outpost Gaming Centers are more than able to host tournaments seating 100 players. By the way, if anyone is wondering what Bernardo da Costa Cabral, Jacques Misonne and Pavlos Akritas are doing now, instead of playing in Pro Tours: they are the owners of Outpost Brussels and are making sure that local players are able to play in Friday Night Magic and other WPN programs.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/Judges4.jpg)When it comes to exciting rules questions both Edwin and Jurgen are disappointing me a little: Edwin comes up with a [Countryside Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Countryside+Crusher) story in which both players involved forget to reveal or observe the revealed cards in good fashion, but his mind is clearly on his lunch. And for a good reason: it's not going to be a very long day today, but tomorrow and Sunday are both a little bit longer with 7 more rounds on Saturday and best-of-5 top-8 showdowns and a PTQ on Sunday.




Feature Match Round 4: Victor v/d Broek vs Menno Dolstra
--------------------------------------------------------


*by Eelco van Ruth*

Both players are undefeated in this tournament and both players are an example of the minimal preparation approach. Menno was in top-8 in one of the many GP Amsterdam's and Victor claims never to have achieved anything. Which is of course not true, because he once was part of a very successful team with Jelger Wiegersma and Frank Karsten? Also, he was at one point 3rd in the European Championships.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/rnd5Viktor_Menno.jpg)Game 1:


Menno quickly builds a couple of 2/2's: [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling) and [Elvish Branchbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender). Vic's [Skeletal Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Changeling) is able to block one and regenerate. In the next turn the 1/1 takes a nibble out of Menno, because a [Hornet Harasser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Harasser) is more then adequate enough to hold the fortress, but Menno plays an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) on the Harasser and swings for 4.  

When Menno makes an [Ambassador Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Oak), accompanied by a 1/1 Elf token, and Victor still doesn't have a play, the next turn some more blood will flow. The Branchbender changes a forest into a Treefolk, but the [Ambassador Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Oak) gets double blocked by the [Skeletal Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Changeling) and a surprise [Dewdrop Spy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dewdrop+Spy). Victor stabilizes at 5 with a consecutive [War-Spike Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Spike+Changeling) and [Fencer Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fencer+Clique) and Menno only reacts with [Seedguide Ash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedguide+Ash). Vic's next play is [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract) and immidiatly the Branchbender is killed in action. Menno just makes [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and adds a 3/3 Beast token. Victor can only respond with a puny [Oona's Blackguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Blackguard) and [Tideshaper Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tideshaper+Mystic), but the Blackguard is able to get rid of Garruk, because Menno made another Beast token. When Victor doesn't add anything more to the board, Menno tries to figure out if he is able to alpha-strike already. Eventually he sends all his guys into the red zone, but before blockers Victor makes Menno look for 3 forests, because the Ash walks into an [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending). Menno still gets through for 3 and puts Victor to 2. With 19 life Menno is still pretty much untouched, but when Victor makes another [Oona's Blackguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Blackguard). His next play is [Warren Weirding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Weirding) targeting himself and the [Skeletal Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Changeling) is sacrificed for the greater good. The 2 Goblin tokens he gets back catch a couple of +1/+1 counters each from the Blackguards and all of a sudden Menno is down 6 and has to discard 4 cards ! Nice play Sir...Menno topdecks a [Lignify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lignify) for the [War-Spike Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Spike+Changeling) and has a [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) for the Blackguard that's only a 1/1 and attacks to put Victor to 1. Vic hits for another 6 though, and again for 3. When an [Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer) on Vic's side and a [Battlewand Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak) and [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) emerge on Menno's, Victor simply attacks once with his whole team and wins game 1.


Victor's preparation for today's Lorwyn/Lorwyn/Morningtide draft is exactly 7 drafts, 5 of which were without Lorwyn. Both Menno and Vic are pretty proud of the fact that they are unbeaten with not too much preparation, but that's ok: the idea here is that both gentlemen are having a lot of fun today. Being 4-0 kinda does that to you...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nethnat08/rnd5Viktor_Menno2.jpg)Game 2:


Menno comes storming out of the gates with [Bosk Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosk+Banneret) and [Ambassador Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Oak). Victor starts out with [Oona's Blackguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Blackguard)s on turn 2 and 3: not too shabby either.  

No blocks are declared when Menno attacks with the whole team and his next play is [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker). Victor successfully called it, I have to mention.  

Victor chooses to attack Menno instead of Garruk, so Menno has to take 3 damage and discard 2 cards, thanks to the double [Oona's Blackguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Blackguard). A second mainphase [Paperfin Rascal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paperfin+Rascal) doesn't win the clash, but still ends up a 4/4 because of the friendly Oona's. It's good to have friends when you're a Rogue.


A [Bog-Strider Ash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog-Strider+Ash) halts Vic's offensive plans, but the 1/1 Blackguard still robs Garruk of a loyalty counter. It was his last, so Garruk leaves the building for this game.  

When Menno attacks back, a [Dewdrop Spy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dewdrop+Spy) enters play as a 4/4 and only 3 damage is dealt to Victor. When Victor attacks back for 6 and makes sure Menno doesn't have more cards in his hand through the discard ability of the double Blackguard AND has an [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) for Menno's swampwalker, Menno quickly scoops up his cards.


Victor wins 2-0


In the talking after the match, Robert van Medevoort points out to Menno that he was probably a little to fast scooping. Especially since at one point Menno was able to play a [Festercreep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festercreep) and activate its ability to wipe a big part of the board. Menno pointed out that he only had one swamp in play, but Robert replied that Garruk knows tricks to make 1 swamp count twice. Menno had to agree that it was an option he had not thought of.  

Victor plays on tomorrow as one of the only undefeated players in the tournament and can start off Saturday with winning the table in round 6 of the Dutch Nationals.

*by Henry van den Brink*

While playing some awkward cards like Faultgrinder and Hearthcage Giant, the overall card quality in Robert's deck is very high, and as I'm writing this he is 2-0. His next round will be a bit harder, as he is playing former national champion and pro tour champion Kamiel Cornelissen.
