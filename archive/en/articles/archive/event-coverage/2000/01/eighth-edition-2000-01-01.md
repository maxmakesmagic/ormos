Not many people realize this, but Wizards of the Coast Research and Development has a lot of things to consider when they design a set. Between Draft, Sealed, Standard, Extended and Block Constructed, every set must be well balanced to make sure each environment is healthy and competitive. On top of all that, the cards must always introduce new, exciting mechanics and concepts that will be interesting to players. Plus, it's necessary to cater to all types of players, from the most cutthroat Pro Tour competitor to the most casual group gamer.


Balance issues aside, what cards do players like the most? Every Magic player has a soft spot in his or her heart for a few cards, and misses playing them in formats where they may have been rotated out or banned. I decided to walk around the Pro Tour area and ask Pro Tour players and non-R&D Wizards of the Coast employees the following question:


If you could put one card into Eighth Edition, what card would that be?


It came as no surprise to me that almost every person who was asked this question spent quite a bit of time thinking it over. Looking over this list reveals a few interesting things. For starters, there is a surprising amount of diversity with the cards named. Very few cards were named by more than one player. In some cases, the card named tells you something about that player. It's fairly obvious why Alan Comer would choose Aluren, and it's easy to see why Chris Pikula would want Meddling Mage to be rotated into the basic set. Reading over this list will give you some insight into which cards Pro Tour players miss using, and will perhaps tell you something interesting about some of the Pro Tour's more intriguing personalities.
