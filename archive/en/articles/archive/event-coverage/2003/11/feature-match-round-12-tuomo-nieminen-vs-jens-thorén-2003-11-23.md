These two players are sitting on 9-2 coming into this round so really need to win all three rounds to be certain of making the top eight though they seem to feel that a 2-1 record should see them in.

Tuomo made the first play of the match with a turn two [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) which he used to power out a [Lodestone Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Myr). Jens replied with an end-step [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and a [Bottle Gnomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes) during his turn. Tuomo played a [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) on his turn and swung in with the [Lodestone Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Myr) pumping it three times with the [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), Myr and a [Tree of Tales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tree+of+Tales). Jens was only able to play a [Skyhunter Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) without any equipment to power it up it looked a bit weak and died to an [Irradiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) on the next attack phase leaving the rest of Jens's team to take the fall. Jens was able to deal with the [Molder Slug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug) that Tuomo played next turn with a [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) but when that was the target of a [Creeping Mold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold) he was forced to concede. 

Tuomo Nieminen 1 - Jens Thorén 0

Both players had early action in this game with Jens using a Talisman to power out a [Skyhunter Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol) whilst Tuomo had a [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) and a [Lumengrid Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Sentinel) which allowed him to tap down large parts of Jens' team. A [Clockwork Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Condor) prevented the [Skyhunter Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol) from attacking and a [Malachite Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malachite+Golem) gave Tuomo a sizeable body to work with. Tuomo upped his offensive powers with a [Broodstar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodstar) for five and then proceeded to play more artifacts so that Jens was forced to concede despite playing a [Living Hive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Hive).

Tuomo Nienen beats Jens Thorén 2-0
