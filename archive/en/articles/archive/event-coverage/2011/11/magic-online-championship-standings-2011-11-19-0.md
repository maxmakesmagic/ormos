*SCORING:* Each of the first three events will award championship points based on the number of match wins as follows:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| # of Match Wins | # of Championship Points |
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 17 |
| 4 | 25 |


 

Each player's earned championship points will be totaled after the first 3 events. The top 2 players will advance to the Championship Finals on Sunday, while the remaining players' standings will be based on the number of championship points earned. DCI tie-breakers will be aggregated across all three tournaments and used if needed.
