![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmil02/980.jpg)Gary Krakower, two time Canadian National Champion and one-time GP winner, came into Milwaukee with only a single bye. By the end of the third round, he had a perfect 3-0 record. Gary has a reputation as being an innovative deckbuilder, and he did not disappoint with his newest creation.

**Ben:** So where have you been lately Gary? I haven't seen you at a tournament in a while.

**Gary:** Well, I sort of fell off the tour, so that put a damper on things. I was qualified for Osaka but decided not to go, and I wasn't q'd for Nice, but I'm back into the game now.

**B:** Tell me how you came up with the idea for this deck.

**G:** Originally I saw the Black/White Braids deck, and I thought it was a great new deck. This became a really perverted version of that deck. On a whim, I threw some [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge)s into the sideboard of the deck before a tournament, and then every game I boarded them in, they simply crushed by opponents! So the Bridges came in main deck for a few of the creatures. The next card to come in was the (Disrupting) Scepter. I play it in every constructed format where it's legal.

**B:** So it's a signature card for you.

**G:** Yeah, and it came in and then all the creatures came out. When I played it yesterday I went 5-2, and every time I used the Scepter, it got some reaction from my opponents. One even asked "is that card legal?"

**B:** Your deck wins by decking your opponent with [Millstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) and [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes), correct?

**G:** The Echoes is my kill card, that's for sure. With the (Innocent) Bloods and (Chainer's) Edicts I control the board, and with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and the Scepters I control hand sizes.

**B:** I bet you've had some opponents simply refuse to concede, though.

**G:** Most opponents concede, but I had one yesterday where he literally had only two creatures left in his deck, and no other way to win. I had to explain to him a few times that he was eventually going to lose, until he finally gave up. He wasn't too happy about that. (Laughs)

**B:** So let's take a look at your sideboard. 

**G:**[Aegis of Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aegis+of+Honor) gives me a win versus Blue/Red and Control Black decks. It stops all their burn, and the [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt)s that black throws at you these days. I had one opponent sit there with a hand full of burn after I dropped a turn one Aegis, and I just kept stripping the cards from his hand as the game went on, while he couldn't cast a single thing.

**B:** The [Addle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Addle)s and (Skeletal) Scryings are pretty standard, but what about your other cards?

**G:**[Crippling Fatigue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Fatigue) is there to kill those annoying mana creatures like (Llanowar) Elves and Birds (of Paradise). The Ray (of Distortion) and [Aura Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aura+Blast) are for Trenches, and [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) decks. The interesting thing I really like about Ray is that I can discard it to my Scepter if I need to keep a Bridge lock going, and then cast it again later out of my graveyard. It's like having an extra [Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) even though I have no hand size.

**B:** What about the [Pay No Heed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pay+No+Heed)?

**G:** It's a great trick against decks that kill you on one shot, especially [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). I was playing on **Magic** Online the other day, and this guy attacked with a 25/26 [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Suddenly, he had a zero power [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and he wasn't too happy about it.

**B:** And lastly, what about the (Orim's) Chant?

**G:** My deck is weak against Tog the first game. It's also doesn't like to see [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), [Lobotomy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy) or [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). [Orim's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) gives me an edge against a control deck, but it also is a really good card to play in response to my opponent's [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).

**B:** Do you think you're going to play this deck at Nationals?

**G:** Well...(Pauses)

**B:** Are you going to Nationals?

**G:** I'm not qualified yet, but I think I'll play there, I just may have to grind if my rating isn't high enough.

**B:** Although the meta-game changes at Nationals depending on what wins the grinders, and your deck is definitely innovative enough that if you win a grinder, other people will react to it.

**G:** That's true. 

**B:** How has the deck performed so far?

**G:** I went 5-2 yesterday in the grinder, but one of those was a fluke. I had him locked down under the Bridge, with only one card in hand, a land. He only had a Rootwalla and Elf in play, and I was at 16. I drew 4 straight lands and died to his two creatures. If I'd drawn any other card in my deck, he'd have no way to win, so I count that as a win for me since it was such a freak accident. The other round I lost I got crushed.

**B:** How do you think you'll do today?

**G:** I'd be happy with 7-1. I honestly just want to make day 2. One lesson I've learned is that if I play a deck I enjoy I do well.
