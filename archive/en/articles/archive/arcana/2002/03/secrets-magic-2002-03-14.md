The *[Secrets of Magic](http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88552)* is a new anthology of short stories edited by Jess Lebow. Each story reveals some previously undisclosed aspect of the **Magic** world.

Our own Rei Nakazawa wrote up a quick blurb for each story and tied them all to specific **Magic** cards, like [Plague Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Rats), [Kukemssa Pirates](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kukemssa+Pirates), and [Balthor the Stout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balthor+the+Stout). You can read Rei's synopsis [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/products/secretsofmagic)â€¦ and then go read the book!
