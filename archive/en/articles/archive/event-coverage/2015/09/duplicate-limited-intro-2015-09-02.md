Sealed limited play is one of the most fun formats for Magic. Unfortunately, the random factor of card distribution adds an element of luck that often overshadows the players' skills. Duplicate Limited solves this problem by giving all the players the exact same mix of cards.


Duplicate Limited is considered by some to be one of the most skill testing limited formats as it requires a great deal of thought. Since players have complete knowledge of the environment, they have to build their deck with the metagame in mind.


While normal Duplicate Limited is challenging, this is the Invitational. The best players in the world deserve to be shaken up a little bit. Each year I pick a theme and build the Duplicate card pool around it. Two years, I made players play with sub-optimal cards while last year I changed all the cards mana costs.


This year I have chosen to build an environment where all the cards have a converted mana cost of one. How will this affect the environment? What percentage of mana will people play? How many colors are workable? What impact will it have on the overall power level? The players will have to answer this and many more questions.


Normally, these players never need an hour for deck construction. Today, they'll be rushing to finish. As one last thing to keep things interesting I have designed then cards specifically for this event. The players have never seen them before and will have to gauge their power level on the fly.


Click [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/duplicate-limited-cards-2015-09-02) for a complete deck list (98 cards, 18 of each color and 8 artifacts) including the text of the ten new cards.


Try building your own deck first and then compare your deck against those of the best players in the world.
