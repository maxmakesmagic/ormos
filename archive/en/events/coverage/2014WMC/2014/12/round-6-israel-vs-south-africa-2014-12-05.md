 For South Africa, the potential to rise into history was compelling as well: no team from the African continent had won the team portion of a World Championship. Winning their way to the World *Magic* Cup title would be historic for them, as well as the history of *Magic* championships. Defeating a World Champion and his teammates along the way would be another boost to their confidence, and rank, if they made Day Two.



There's only one team in the World Magic Cup they could have been playing against.


They already have the reigning World Champion. Now they wanted to add a team championship to their list of records. The team from Israel, captained by the talented 2013 World Champion Shahar Shenhar, was in good spirits. While he was the only returning member of the team from the previous year, his confidence in his teammates was foremost coming in to the event: Shenhar spoke highly of the new friends he made preparing to battle in the potential second set of Sunday games to play.


While Shenhar has traveled the world throughout the year, he found time to meet up with most of his team. "I played in a prerelease with them in Israel and we hung out for a day," he said. How does the team feel now that it's living up to the captain's expectations? "Feeling great. Our record is really great," he said. They had only taken one loss on the day. "Basically, the round we lost I felt like we couldn't really do anything. I drew really poorly; it was frustrating. I don't feel like I could have done more to help the team than I did."



 With world caliber experience already under his belt, including last year's World *Magic* Cup, it seemed like his teammates were leaning on him hard. "Oh yeah," he said. "I've been 'triple queuing' as you say. The reason I say that is because when someone asks you a question [in a game]. To answer it you have to be paying attention to their match so you don't have to reassess during the game. If I don't have an answer I'll tell them they need to make the decision: they're the pilot. But I've been trying to pay attention to all the games so I can answer them. It's exhausting, different from the World Championship, more running around. I wouldn't say it's harder, just different. It's a different kind of environment as well."





*While Team Israel and captain Shahar Shenhar sought a potentially memorable Sunday, Team South Africa's goal was looking to earn the field world title for the African continent.*
