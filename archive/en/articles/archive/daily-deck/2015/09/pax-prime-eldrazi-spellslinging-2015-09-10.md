 Melissa is a former Magic pro player and strategy writer who is now working in R&D on the Play Design team. 






This week on Daily Decks, I'm showcasing the decks that were used during our Eldrazi vs. Zendikari Spellslinging event during PAX Prime 2015. Today is the final installment of the series, the dreaded Eldrazi deck! This is the deck that our celebrities battled with against *Magic* fans at PAX.


Who were the celebrities, you may ask? Most of our celebrities were members of Wizards R&D, like Aaron Forsythe and Mark Rosewater. *Magic* Pro Tour competitors, such as Luis Scott-Vargas, were also present. We even had popular content providers like Nate Holt from Walking the Planes and the folks from LoadingReadyRun. Finally, we hosted some other non-*Magic* celebrities who are huge fans of *Magic*, like Felicia Day, Wil Wheaton, and Chris Kluwe.


Building the Eldrazi deck was quite the challenge for me because I knew that many players with vastly different backgrounds would be playing with it. While I was confident that someone like LSV could handle any level of complexity, I knew that Felicia Day didn't have as much experience with *Magic*, so I had to take that into consideration while putting this deck together.

I knew that I had to include some Eldrazi creatures that had annihilator because that was one of the most iconic mechanics from the *Zendikar* block, so once I chose which ones I wanted to include, I added ways to get them into play quickly, like [Growth Spasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Growth+Spasm), [Eldrazi Temple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple), and plenty of ways to make [Eldrazi Spawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Spawn). The next cards I wanted to include were ways to survive the early game, like [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) and [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure).


Finally, we had to include a few surprises in the deck. We added one copy each of Kozilek's Channeler and Eldrazi Devastator from *Battle for Zendikar* so our players could see some sweet new spoiler cards. It was pretty fun to cast these and see the look on my opponent's face when he realized what set it was from!
