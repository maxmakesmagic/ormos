One of the first cities in Japan to open its streets to foreigners, Yokohama is home to the largest Chinatown in the country, and its international connections are reflected in its architecture and food. The city is centered around the Minato Mirai 21 district, a business and commerce district that features the Landmark Tower, the nation's tallest building at 70 floors and nearly 296 meters. Another notable attraction in the city is the Ramen (Chinese noodle) Museum.


Few cities in the world are as synonymous with **Magic**'s history as Yokohama. The first non-US location of the World Championships in 1999 (won by Kai Budde), Yokohama has since hosted a number of premier events. In 2005, the city was again host to the World Championships, which saw the "home team" dominate, with the titles of World Champion, World Team Champion, and Pro Player of the Year all being captured by Japanese players. In 2008, as the home of defending champion Masaya Kitayama, Yokohama was the site of the National Championship, which saw a resurgent Masashi Oiso take home the title. Come join us at Grand Prix Yokohama 2012 and witness another chapter written in **Magic**  history in this scenic city by the sea! 


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

* Deck lists are required.
* Each player must use the same deck on Day 2 that he or she used on Day 1.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Grand Prix Yokohama will be run over two days using modified Swiss-style rounds of 50 minutes each. The number of rounds on Day 1 will be determined based on the number of players registered, Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event.
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

 The head judge for Grand Prix Yokohama will be Jeff Morrow (Level 4, USA). If you are interested in volunteering for Grand Prix Yokohama as a judge, please contact Kenji Suzuki, Regional Coordinator Japan/Korea, through the [Judge Center](http://judge.wizards.com/).
