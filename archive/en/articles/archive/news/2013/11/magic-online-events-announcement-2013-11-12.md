Magic Online Events Announcement
================================



 Posted in **News**
 on November 12, 2013 










Hi,


Today's article will be discussing events on **Magic Online** as they will exist after tomorrow's downtime concludes.


If you haven't already, read Worth Wollpert's announcement ["Changes to **Magic Online**  Events"](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/273&date=11/13/2013)  for his statement about the changes to **Magic Online**  events. If you would like to share feedback with the **Magic Online**  team, please send an email to [MTGOfeedback@wizards.com](mailto:mtgofeedback@wizards.com).


In this article you will find:


* [Queue Changes](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#changes)
* [Qualifier Points and Player of the Year event information](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#qps)
* [Complete Queue Events available in **Magic Online**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#list)

Â 




Queue Changes
We have introduced a number of new Queue Events for both Limited and Constructed play. You can view the full details of the Queue Events below.


For Limited we have created a [*Theros*  Six-Booster Sealed Event](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#6bsealed) and a [Qualifier Points Only Phantom Cube Draft 8-4](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#qponly). In addition, [Two Ticket Tuesdays](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#twotickettuesdays) will continue throughout November but now as a Queue instead of a series of Scheduled Events. In addition, we slightly altered the prizes of the following *Return to Ravnica*  Draft events: [8-4](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68/=rtrblockdraft8-4), [4-3-2-2](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68/=rtrblockdraft4-3-2-2), and [Swiss](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68/=rtrblockdraftswiss) (follow each link to see the updated event prize structure).


For Constructed, we have introduced two new single-elimination queues, a Pauper 5-3-2-2 and a Momir Basic 5-3-2-2 queue. These two new queues will join the already offered Standard 5-3-2-2, Modern 5-3-2-2, Legacy 5-3-2-2, and *Theros*  5-3-2-2. We have updated the names of these events to better distinguish the prizes and structure of the events.


Our [Constructed Two-Player Queues](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#2psecon) will lose the 100-Card Singleton, Hero's Path Standard, and Standard Singleton events. These events were removed to make room for the large number of queues being added to the Constructed Queue room. 100-Card Singleton, Hero's Path Standard, and Standard Singleton will all continue to be available as casual play formats. No other Two-Player Queue events will be altered.


As we will no longer be offering Thursday Night **Magic Online**  as a Scheduled Event, we will also be removing the Thursday Night **Magic Online**  promotional card from the prizes of our [New Player Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#newplayer).




Qualifier Points and Player of the Year Event Information
**Magic Online** players will continue to win Qualifier Points (QPs) in the current and future seasons. As we will not be holding the Season 12 MOCS Preliminary or Finals events, we will introduce a Qualifier Point queue ([Qualifier Point Only Phantom Cube Draft 8-4](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#qponly)) that will allow players to use the Qualifier Points from the corresponding season to participate in this queue described below. During the downtime on November 27, Land Tax will be granted as normal. Players who earn 15 or more Season 12 QPs will receive the Land Tax promo card. After the downtime on November 27, players will be able to use Season 12 QPs to enter the new [Qualifier Point Only Phantom Cube Draft 8-4](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11122013/queues#qponly) queue.


QPs will still accumulate and count towards the [Player of the Year standings](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mol/poy) and we will be holding the Player of the Year event on December 14, 2013, at 11:00 AM PST with no changes to the event structure. The manner in which you will qualify will remain unchanged; we will be inviting the top 150 players in the Limited standings and the Constructed standings to the Player of the Year Championship event.
