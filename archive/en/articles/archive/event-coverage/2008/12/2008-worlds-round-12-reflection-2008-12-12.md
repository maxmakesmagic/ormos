On one side, former Rookie of the Year Yuuya Watanabe. On the other, Kenji Tsumura, media darling and **Magic** superstar. Both of them were firmly in the hunt for a Sunday berth, having put up 4-1 records so far in draft.

**Game 1**

Tsumura started out with an [Obelisk of Jund](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Jund) after Watanabe played [Cylian Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cylian+Elf) and [Sighted-Caste Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sighted-Caste+Sorcerer) for early beats. A fourth-turn [Carrion Thrash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Thrash) caused Watanabe to pause and consider his own fourth turn. After reflection, he chose to send in his Elf. Tsumura blocked, drawing out [Sigil Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+Blessing) and sending the Thrash to the bin. Watanabe played [Druid of the Anima](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid+of+the+Anima) and passed it back.

Tsumura had another Thrash at the ready. [Welkin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Guide) sent the [Cylian Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cylian+Elf) to the air, knocking Tsumura down to 12. He untapped and played a [Blood Cultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Cultist). Watanabe added [Court Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Archers) to his squad, then hit in the air for 4. Tsumura cycled [Viscera Dragger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Dragger) at end of turn. 

[Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) from Tsumura caught Watanabe with [Sigil Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+Blessing) and [Kiss of the Amesha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiss+of+the+Amesha) as his only two cards. He buffed his team in response. Tsumura held him up and thought for a minute. Emerging from the tank, he held off on using his [Blood Cultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Cultist). He passed the turn back to the empty-handed Watanabe.

Watanabe drew a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and swung in the air again, leaving Tsumura at just 4 life. [Blood Cultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Cultist) took care of [Druid of the Anima](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid+of+the+Anima). Tsumura unearthed his Dragger, hit for three, and threw it at the flier with [Bone Splinters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Splinters). Watanabe drew [Hindering Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hindering+Light), and now Tsumura was firmly in the driver’s seat. [Blood Cultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Cultist) took care of the Sorcerer, and [Minion Reflector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minion+Reflector) hit play.

Now Tsumura started to summon monsters and swing in with their duplicates. [Knight of the Skyward Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Skyward+Eye) from Watanabe was nothing compared to a parade of [Undead Leotau](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Leotau), [Kathari Screecher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kathari+Screecher), and [Dreg Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreg+Reaver). Soon they were on to Game 2.

Tsumura 1, Watanabe 0

Both players sideboarded for the next game. Tsumura brought in [Incurable Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incurable+Ogre) for [Scavenger Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenger+Drake), and Watanabe ditched [Jungle Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Weaver) for [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus).

**Game 2**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/r12_tsumura.jpg)*Kenji Tsumura considers his move.*Watanabe again had the early beats thanks to [Knight of the Skyward Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Skyward+Eye) and [Sighted-Caste Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sighted-Caste+Sorcerer). Tsumura threatened the latter with [Vithian Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vithian+Stinger). Watanabe drew, then sighed. He had no third land. Tsumura summoned [Incurable Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incurable+Ogre) and stung the Sorcerer during Watanabe’s upkeep. Watanabe protected it with his lone blue mana, and his deck pranked him by offering [Deft Duelist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft+Duelist).

Tsumura then tapped five and apologized as he dropped [Volcanic Submersion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Submersion) on Watanabe’s lone [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). Watanabe stuck out his lower lip and nodded. Lands were not forthcoming for Watanabe, and Tsumura only had to make a couple more monsters to wrap up the match.

Tsumura 2, Watanabe 0

Afterward Watanabe showed his opening hand: [Knight of the Skyward Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Skyward+Eye), [Sighted-Caste Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sighted-Caste+Sorcerer), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), alongside [Steward of Valeron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steward+of+Valeron), [Rhox Charger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Charger), and [Naya Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Battlemage).

With six [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and a Panorama in his deck, Tsumura agreed that he had to keep it: “If he draws one within three turns, his hand is amazing.”
