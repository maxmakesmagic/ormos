After careful review of the play patterns across two seasons since the debut of Planeswalker Points, Wizards of the Coast will be adjusting the point thresholds for Grand Prix byes.

The new levels will be 400 Seasonal Planeswalker Points for a one-round bye, 750 for a two-round bye, and 1500 for a three-round bye. These changes go into effect immediately for the April 2–August 19, 2012 season. Players who reached the previous levels during the December 26, 2011–April 1, 2012 season will receive byes in the current season of Grand Prix based on the old thresholds.
