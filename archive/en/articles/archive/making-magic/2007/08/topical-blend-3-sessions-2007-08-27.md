Welcome  to Topical Blend #3. For those of you that have no idea what I'm talking about, let me quickly recap. Whenever I do a Topical Blend, I ask my readers to send in suggestions for topics both **Magic** and non-**Magic**. I pick fifty of each suggestion and then let all of you vote on which one you want from each category. Then I write a column the intertwines the two choices.


My first Topical Blend interweaved My Ten Biggest Design Mistakes with Girls. It was called "[To Err Is Human](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/topical-blend-1-%E2%80%93-err-human-2005-03-07-0)," and it was one of my most popular columns ever. [The second Topical Blend](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/topical-blend-2-2005-12-12) combined Designing The Sixth Color with "Mark Rosewater Is @$^#%#$ Insane!" (a common header on a certain **Magic**-themed board). The article is one of my "out there" columns. If you go to the link let me stress that where you end up is in fact the article even if it doesn't seem like it. Really.


Which leads us to today. Let's start by seeing what topics you all selected for me. First the **Magic** poll:

Okay, we have The Top Ten Coolest Creatures in **Magic** and **Dungeons & Dragons**. I'll admit I was a little upset when I first saw the results because I felt the two topics were a little too easy to combine. After all, "The Top Ten Coolest **Magic** Creatures Inspired by **Dungeons & Dragons**" is more than worthy as a topic of a column, but the reason I do Topical Blends is to stretch myself as a writer. As such, I decided to try a much less obvious path to connect the two. I hope you like it.
