Grand Prix Prague got 2014 rolling, and there was a significant shake-up in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings—a shake-up that looked extremely unlikely halfway through Day One of [the Grand Prix](/en/events/coverage/hrvatskas-horvat-crowned-master-modern-prague). 

 The man at the center of the action was [Pro Tour *Theros*](/en/events/coverage/ptthr13) champion Jérémy Dezani of France. As the fates decreed, he started his campaign with a finals rematch from Dublin against teammate Pierre Dagen. Dezani lost that one, and two rounds later found himself with two losses, staring down imminent elimination from the tournament. He fought back, climbing to 6–2, before facing another Pro Tour champion, Italy's [Samuele Estratti](/en/events/coverage/ptphi11), with the winner making Day Two, and the loser going home. 

 Arguably, there's nobody in world **Magic** who is more dangerous than Dezani when given a tournament lifeline. Having defeated Estratti to advance, he wasted no time in making his continued participation count. On and on he went, grinding his way up the leaderboard—118th, 78th, 58th, 31st, 22nd, 9th. In the final round, he was once again behind, but Michael Filler of Germany wasn't going to stop Dezani from reaching a sixth Grand Prix Top 8. 

Although Dezani couldn't advance past the quarterfinals, falling to Carlos Moral of Spain, his epic nine-match streak sees him overtake Willy Edel, Yuuya Watanabe, Shuhei Nakamura, and Sam Black, taking him to No. 5 in our Top 25. More modest gains were made by Martin Juza (up one to No. 14) and Raphael Levy (up one to No. 19).

 Next up is Grand Prix Sacramento, where the sunshine state plays host to *Theros* Limited and many of the leading contenders. Join us next week for the latest news from the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
