![Gustha's Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gustha%27s+Scepter)Several people have written in in response to Mark's [Monday column](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr45) to ask, "How did Brian Hacker win a game on the second turn when all he played on the first turn was [Gustha's Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustha%27s+Scepter)?"

Alan Comer was at the tournament where it happened, and he was nice enough to explain it to us.

"Brian played a [Gustha's Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustha%27s+Scepter) and said 'go' on his first turn, and then at the end of his opponent's turn he 'hid' a [Windfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windfall) under the Scepter. On his second turn, he drew the card he was hoping for -- [Tolarian Academy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Academy). He played the Academy and a bunch of artifacts, including [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond). He then sacrificed the Diamond for three blue man and discarded what was left in his hand, then tapped the Scepter to retrieve the [Windfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windfall) and that was all he needed."

Hacker's deck packed [Twiddle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle), of all things, for untapping the Academy. With a new hand of seven cards, it was easy for him to generate more mana, untap the Academy, and draw more cards.

Hacker's deck was also remarkable for its inclusion of [Yawgmoth's Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Will), which allowed him to put all his [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal)s and [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)s back into play once he started "going off." Killing his opponent was no problem once he hit that point.

This story just goes to show how insane many of the combo pieces in *Urza's Saga* really were.
