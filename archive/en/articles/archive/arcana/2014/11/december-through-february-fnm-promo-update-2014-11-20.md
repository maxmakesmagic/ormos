It's Thursday morning in cloudy Renton, Washington, when this article goes live, but lots of folks are already thinking about Friday...and more specifically, Friday Night *Magic*! One aspect of Friday Night *Magic* is the FNM promo, and once a month we like to show you which promos are coming up!


Let's take a look at the promos you can pick up at FNM over the next few months.


December
========


December might be winter for the northern hemisphere, but [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) is sure to keep many people nice and toasty. Or just plain dead.

January
=======


A new year makes a good time to add new art to your...Goblin deck? Kev Walker updates the most frenzied of Goblins. I wouldn't expect your opponents to do much blocking once you get your hands on a few of these [Frenzied Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzied+Goblin)s.

When your opponent tries to play a big spell to set up a strong endgame, you can say "Nope!" in style with this [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke) promo.
