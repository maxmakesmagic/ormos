Heather Hudson had to work overtime to sketch, revise and paint the art for *Onslaught's* five comes-into-play-tapped cycling lands ([Secluded Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Steppe), [Lonely Sandbar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lonely+Sandbar), [Barren Moor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Moor), [Forgotten Cave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Cave) and [Tranquil Thicket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquil+Thicket)). Now that she's had her rest, let's celebrate by taking a look at the sketches of -- not one -- but **ALL FIVE of the cycling lands**. 

 In addition, you'll get to see a peek at some of the **artist's notes** that Ms. Hudson provided with her initial sketches. This is a fascinating look into the mind of the artist as she mentally composes the piece in full color, while sketching it in black ink on white paper.

Finally, for each card you'll see the **final art**. 

 Let's get started, shall we? Click the card's name to pop up the final card image. 

### [Secluded Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Steppe)

**Sketch:**![Secluded Steppe sketch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_secludedsteppe_sketch.jpg)

**Artist's notes:**
> *Sunlight from upper right corner - clouds over head are fluffy & flat bottomed, & cast shadows below on the far right. Up above, higher clouds streak violet against a pale blue sky fading toward green at horizon. Plains covered with golden grasses, dimming toward burnt sienna in shadows.*

**Final art:**![Secluded Steppe final art](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_secludedsteppe.jpg)

### [Lonely Sandbar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lonely+Sandbar)

**Sketch:**![Lonely Sandbar sketch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_LonelySandbar_sketch.jpg)

**Artist's notes:**
> *Sandbar - sand is peach colored where wet, reflecting sky. Fog is dark at horizon, w/ violet tones rising to pale pink against darker blue sky. Bird is almost black & white against midtone fog. Waves rolling up sand bar at bottom of picture have a lot of high values in greens & violets, and some subdued yellows in back of foam: some transparency of water, but not enough to pull focus from island.*

**Final art:**![Lonely Sandbar final art](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_LonelySandbar.jpg)

### [Barren Moor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Moor)

**Sketch:**![Barren Moor sketch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_BarrenMoor_sketch.jpg)

**Artist's notes:**
> *'Neutral' achieved w/ subdued greens, oranges & (lots of) violets. Reflection on surface of ooze & mists steaming up add high value interest to picture. Branches wash out to subtle silhouettes in distance: only closest branch is detailed. Island is low-value & featureless (burnt & rwa umbers?). Nothing grows on it.*

**Final art:**![Barren Moor final art](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_BarrenMoor.jpg)

### [Forgotten Cave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Cave)

**Sketch:**![Forgotten Cave sketch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_ForgottenCave_sketch.jpg)

**Artist's notes:**
> *Mountain defined in yellows, oranges & subdued red violet shadows. Pink (i.e., orange - violet) clouds part & flow around it thru a khaki-colored sky.*

**Final art (Hudson's art was swapped onto a basic *Onslaught* mountain, and this art by Tony Szczudlo became [Forgotten Cave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Cave)):**![Forgotten Cave final art](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_ForgottenCave.jpg)

### [Tranquil Thicket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquil+Thicket)

**Sketch:**![Tranquil Thicket sketch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/cycl_TranquilThicket_sketch.jpg)

**Artist's notes:**
> *There are going to be some careful uses of orange, brown & subdued violet in the left upper background, the shadow & the water, to pop yellow-green light from the upper right corner. Tree on right is backlit & focus should fall on little waterfall in center (white water on dark, wet rocks).*
