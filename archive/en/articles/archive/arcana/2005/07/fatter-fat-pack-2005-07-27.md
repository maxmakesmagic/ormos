The fat pack just got fatter.

The *Ninth Edition* fat pack sports a brand spanking new format for the fat pack, stuffed inside a box big enough that it might as well read "WIDE LOAD" on the side:

  
*Ninth Edition fat pack product image*

Yes, that's *one* fat pack. And yes, that's some nice art of the *Ninth Edition's* 
[Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Serra%2BAngel) and [Hypnotic Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hypnotic%2BSpecter) locked in battle -- there's more on the card boxes inside.

Speaking of insides, this new fat pack format features:

* two card boxes with a new art piece that wraps around them,
* six of these cool color dividers that fit in the card boxes,
* a mini-poster built into the reverse of the card box wrapper,
* a *Ninth Edition* Spindown life counter,
* a 40-card land pack,
* a *Ninth Edition* player's guide,
* a special oversized *Ninth Edition* card (see right),
* and six *Ninth Edition* booster packs.

Now *that's* a fat pack. (So much for our 2005 New Year's resolutions to keep our products slim and trim.)
