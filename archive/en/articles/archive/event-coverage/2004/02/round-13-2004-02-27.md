Rickard Österberg v. Gabriel Nassif
-----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r13fm1_1.jpg)Argh, [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). I don't know what to keep." - Rickard Österberg


Certainly nobody had [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) on their list of cards to watch out for, but France's Gabriel Nassif is hardly one to play by the rules. Taking advantage of the presence of [Reap and Sow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) and [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) to maximize [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), he designed a truly heinous [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) deck. His cadre of playtesters tweaked it to perfection, and now it's taking the tournament by storm. Norway's Rickard Österberg is piloting Big Red, and didn't much care for his chances.


Österberg led with [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and groaned when Nassif showed him a [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) for a [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) of his own. He made a pair of [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb)s and passed the turn. Nassif put his 'Post into play and let him have free reign. Österberg needed mana and so cycled away his Spellbombs, finally finding a third land. Nassif continued to build up [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s. Österberg made a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) and was done. Nassif played an [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) and a third [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).


"Holy moly." - Rickard Österberg


"Yeah. Great. Lots of mana." - Gabriel Nassif


Österberg was swimming in it, too. He attacked for two and [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)ed Nassif down to ten. Nassif blew the [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) at end of turn, then untapped and [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver)ed Österberg. He turned over a hand with two more [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s, along with [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) and [Furnace Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon). He drew a [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).


Nassif put the [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) into play, along with the Sphere, then cast the Dragon. With its ability on the stack he popped the Sphere so he'd have two red mana left over. That he used to squander the [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s. Nassif untapped and entwined [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) to get himself the [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) / [Leonin Abunas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) combo. He also played a Jens and checked that Österberg had only one [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) left in his deck before giving it back to him.


Österberg hit with the Dragon and played another sad robot. Nassif entwined another [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), this time for [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) and [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus). [Reap and Sow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) cleared away one of Österberg's two [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s. He ended his turn and crossed his fingers. Österberg untapped, drew a [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), and popped it for red. That gave him [Flamebreak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamebreak). He could cast it, then [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) the Abunas, then [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) the Angel, and then swing in for one with his [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus). All this would bring Nassif to one, and leave him open to a lethal counterattack. With no outs, he scooped. Nassif breathed a sigh of relief.


Nassif 1 - Österberg 0


Österberg led off with a Talisman, and Nassif put on his thinking face before ridding himself of it with [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize). He played a [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) as his second land and ended his turn. Österberg played one of his own and made a [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). Nassif untapped and played a forest before putting another 'Post into play with [Reap and Sow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r13fm1_2.jpg)Österberg untapped and cycled his Sphere to get a Simulacrum into play. Nassif counted his opponent's mana and didn't like the number he got, so he entwined a [Reap and Sow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) on Österberg's [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). Viridian SHaman took out the Simulacrum. Österberg played another [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and hit for one with his [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus).


Now it was Nassif's time to explode. An entwined [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) got him Abunas and [Duplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant), and a [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) from his hand joined the Abunas in play. Österberg sent [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) at his head, but he was still at three. Nassif untapped and put [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) into play. The Dragon was Österberg's only out, and he did not draw it.
