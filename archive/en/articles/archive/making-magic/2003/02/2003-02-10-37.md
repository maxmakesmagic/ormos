There are numerous ways to choose a topic for the column. Every other week is a theme week, so those weeks are the easiest. Ideas for the other columns can come from many places. Sometimes it’s a hot topic that every one is discussing. Sometimes it’s a misconception that you want to correct. Sometimes it’s a silly idea (you know, like, “Choose Your Own Adventure”) that you want to explore. Sometimes it’s a letter that you want to reply to.

Next week is Banned & Restricted Week so that will set your topic. Perhaps you’ll talk about why the game needs banned & restricted lists. That sounds good.

You spend a chunk of time writing a fabulous article that is insightful yet pithy.
