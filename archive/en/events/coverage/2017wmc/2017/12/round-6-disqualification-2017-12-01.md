During Round 6 of the 2017 World *Magic* Cup, David Wolfe from Ireland played [Chart a Course](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chart+a+Course) and discarded two cards before passing the turn. Those two cards—[God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift) and an [Angel of Invention](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Invention)—were instrumental for the player to play [Refurbish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Refurbish) on the following turn and not lose the game over the following two turns. The player's only other creature in his graveyard was a [Sacred Cat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Cat).


After an investigation, the judge ruled the infraction—a Game Rule Violation for discarding too many cards—was intentional to gain an advantage. As such, Wolfe was disqualified from the World *Magic* Cup. The Irish team will continue to play on Day Two with two players, taking a team match loss each round.
