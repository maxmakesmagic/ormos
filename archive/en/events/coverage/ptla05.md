Packing an old-school [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) deck, Pro Tour veteran Antoine Ruel fought his way through the 340-player field to become champion of Pro Tour-Los Angeles 2005.


Ruel eschewed the new Extended format's popular [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) / [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) addition to the classic 'Tog build and it proved to be a smart decision. He started his run through the Top 8 by defeating Tsuyoshi Fujita and his Boros Deck Wins 3-1 and never looked back.


Facing current Player of the Year leader Kenji Tsumura in the semifinals, Ruel's classic 'Tog waded through Tsumura's Dredgatog build in rapid fashion. The player whom Antoine's brother Olivier claimed was the best in the world could do little to stop Antoine's march to the finals, falling 3-0.


After waiting nearly an hour as Billy Moreno came back to defeat Chris McDaniel in the other semifinal, Ruel got his crack at the Texan's Blue-green 'Tog Madness deck under the finals spotlights. Ruel never let up, cracking early with [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) throwdown thanks to a well-timed [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) . After a touch-and-go Game 2 win, Ruel used his other game-breaking creature -- [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror) -- to secure the victory and take home the title.


With the win, Antoine not only got an early birthday present (he turns 26 on Monday), but he also thrusts himself into the Player of the Year race as we look toward the World Championships at the end of November.


The dust has far from settled as the **Magic**  world starts down the rotated Extended path. Many strategies were on display in Los Angeles over the weekend, with almost 50 different deck archetypes being used by the world's top players. Find one that fits your style, hit your local Pro Tour Qualifier and maybe you'll be hoisting the winner's trophy at Pro Tour-Honolulu!
