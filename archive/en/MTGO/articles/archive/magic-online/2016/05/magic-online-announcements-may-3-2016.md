**Important .NET Framework Update**


Remember that after the May 4 downtime, *Magic Online* is upgrading to use .NET 4.5.2. This change means some users may also have to upgrade the .NET Framework on their machine in order to play *Magic Online*. If you do not have this version of .NET, *Magic Online* will prompt you upgrade, but you can update ahead of time to avoid login delays after the downtime.


You can visit [this website](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh925568(v=vs.110).aspx) for information on how to determine which .NET Framework is installed on your machine. If you do need to upgrade your .NET Framework, please visit [this website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642) to obtain the upgrade at no charge.


Windows Vista does support .NET 4.5.2, but only if Vista users have Service Pack 2 installed. We’ve also uncovered an issue with Windows Vista Service Pack 2 that prevents players from making store purchase using credit cards. We’re investigating a fix, but do not have an ETA yet. PayPal still works correctly.


Also remember that Windows XP does not support .NET 4.5.2, so those users will have to upgrade their operating system to continue playing *Magic Online*.


Depending on the version of .NET you’re currently using, downloading these updates can occasionally take a significant amount of time, so we recommend downloading as soon as possible

**Reminder: Place Redemption Orders Before May 4**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime, *Magic Online* will *not* be processing set redemptions. **This means that if your order isn't made prior to the May 4 downtime, it won't be processed until May 18.**

**Downtime for May 4, 2016**


* All tournaments will close Wednesday, May 4, at 5:00 a.m. PT (UTC -7)
* Store and trade activity will be suspended at approximately 7:45 a.m. PT (UTC -7)
* The system will be down from 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m. PT (UTC -7)

**Gameplay**


* Duel Scene | Players should no longer experience lag while quickly tapping multiple lands or creatures.

* Cardset | [Odric, Lunarch Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Lunarch+Marshal) can now properly grant hexproof if his controller also controls a creature with hexproof when his triggered ability resolves.

* Cardset | [Djinn of Wishes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Djinn+of+Wishes) no longer requires the player to play the revealed card.

* Cardset | The activated ability of [Phyrexian Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Devourer) now correctly puts some number of +1/+1 counters onto the creature it's on, whether it's [Phyrexian Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Devourer) or a creature that has a copy of that ability (such as [Necrotic Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Ooze)).
* Cardset | [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), [Mystic Meditation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Meditation), and [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) no longer allow a player to incorrectly discard a single card using the [Undo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undo) function (default: CTRL+Z).

* Cardset | Triggered abilities that copy instants and sorceries that target only the creature they're on (such as those found on Zada, [Hedron Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crawler) and [Ink-Treader Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Treader+Nephilim)) will now correctly cause the spell copies to trigger abilities with a trigger condition of a creature becoming the target of a spell or ability (such as that found on [Silverfur Partisan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan) and Illusionary Dragon), even if the player uses the OK button to automatically distribute the copies rather than manually selecting the targets for the copies.
* Cardset | Permanents that tap another creature as a cost (such as [Veteran Warleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Warleader)) can no longer incorrectly tap themselves.
* Cardset | [That Which Was Taken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken) has taken away the indestructible ability from permanents without divinity counters.
* Cardset | Permanents can no longer be sacrificed to activate a mana ability while activating an ability that also requires the permanent to be sacrificed.
* Cardset | The delayed trigger created by [Narset Transcendent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset+Transcendent)'s second loyalty ability will no longer incorrectly trigger from spells cast from zones other than the hand.
* Cardset | Spells that deal damage and create a replacement effect to exile the damaged creature if it would die that turn (such as [Burn from Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+from+Within)) no longer show extra text in the game log.
