With the new *Theros* set on display in Sealed Deck and Booster Draft play in the main event plus a large number of side events throughout the weekend— including on Friday—Grand Prix Toronto could indeed set an attendance record for a Canadian Grand Prix. 


 Located at the International Center (a stone's throw from Pearson International Airport), travelers will have no difficulty getting to the venue. Numerous renovations have been done to this modern facility in recent years, and we're excited to see **Magic** return to this location. 


 In addition to a challenging Sealed Deck/Booster Draft main event, the weekend offers something to appeal to **Magic** players of every taste and ability. It doesn't matter if you're coming for just a couple of hours or committed to the entire weekend, Grand Prix Toronto has something for you. The schedule features such events as constructed tournaments offering major prizes and casual Two-Headed Giant and Commander formats, culminating with the increasingly popular Sunday Super Series, That tournament offers a trip to Seattle to hobnob with the folks from Wizards of the Coast next February! Visit [www.westcanevents.com](http://www.westcanevents.com) for a full side-event schedule, as well as a list of vendors, artists, and additional info. 


  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering** Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to step up your game, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, the Grand Prix features a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings. Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2013).*

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day 1 will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day 2 will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
