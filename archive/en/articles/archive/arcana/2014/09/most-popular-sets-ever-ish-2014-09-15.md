For the [Community Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/occ14) this past weekend, we had a cool eight-pack Sealed format where you, the community, got to vote on what packs were added to the sealed pool. Then, not only was it played at the Community Cup, but players could experience it online. It turned out to be a pretty crazy-looking format—but it could have gone any number of ways if the votes had tilted this way or that.



In fact, it was pretty interesting how the voting turned out. So interesting we're going to share it here today. Did the right pack win? How different could things have been if a few votes were shifted one way or the other? Somewhere out there, there's a parallel universe (or an Internet message board) with the answer.
