To celebrate *From the Vault: Angels,* we have another handy-dandy Angel quiz! Check your *Magic* knowledge surrounding all things angelic. As usual, [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) and Changelings don't count. Also as usual, answers after the awesome new art for [Iridescent Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iridescent+Angel).


1. What is the largest Angel by power and toughness?
2. There are twelve cards that put Angel tokens into play. Which is the only one that's an artifact?
3. The word "seraph" refers to a specific type of angel. In *Magic*, there are eight cards that have "Seraph" in their name. Seven of these cards are creatures; what is the noncreature card?
4. What is the name of the only five-colored Angel?
5. How many artists have illustrated [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) on tournament-playable [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) cards?
6. How many green Angels are there?
7. Which Angel was designed by Director of Global Brand Marketing, Mark Purvis?
8. In *Time Spiral* block, [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) got timeshifted into a different color, with a different creature type. Name the color and creature type.
9. What is the only Angel that doesn't have flying and doesn't have a built-in way to gain flying?
10. An archangel is another specific type of angel. There are three cards that have "Archangel" in their name and are not creatures. Which cards are they?

[Iridescent Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iridescent+Angel) | Art by [Ryan Alexander Lee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Ryan+Alexander+Lee%22%5D)


Answers:


1. [Avacyn, Angel of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+Angel+of+Hope): 8/8
2. [Moonsilver Spear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonsilver+Spear)
3. [Seraph Sanctuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seraph+Sanctuary)
4. [Maelstrom Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Archangel)
5. Four, with the most recent inclusion being Rebecca Guay's [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) in *From the Vault: Angels*! (Before this, Rebecca's card art was only available on an oversized version of the card.)
6. Trick question—there are ZERO mono-green Angels, but six Angels with green in their casting cost.
7. [Tariel, Reckoner of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tariel%2C+Reckoner+of+Souls). You can read about the entire process from design to print [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/building-tariel-2011-12-19).
8. [Serra Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Sphinx)—a blue Sphinx
9. [Sustaining Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sustaining+Spirit). This is a tricky one, as the card was originally a Guardian, only gaining the Angel type later on.
10. [Opal Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opal+Archangel), [Archangel's Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel%27s+Light), and [Vault of the Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+the+Archangel) [*Editor's note: The quiz originally listed only two noncreature Archangels, but we were reminded of a third.*]
