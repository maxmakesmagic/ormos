"Sketches" is a new regular feature in Magic Arcana that will showcase the intermediate steps of the art process. Putting art on cards is a four step progression, starting with a description from the creative team and ending with the card itself. Today's card is *Torment*'s [Vengeful Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams), by Mark Tedin.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This card should show an angel in the center of a group of dark, evil beings. The beings were attacking the angel, but because of the her spell have now started to disappear or dissolve away. The main focus of the card is the huge size of the spell."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Mark Tedin, along with some of his own notes. The card was called "Angel's Purge" in its initial incarnation.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of Mark's final painting.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
