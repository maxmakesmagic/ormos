Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).


The biggest development of the week was not actually on the site itself, but on the Facebook pages that represent the Mirran and Phyrexian factions. Each faction got a recruitment video designed to lure you (yes, *you!*) to its side. Go to the [Mirran Faction Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/mirrodin-faction/111175072274346) and the [Phyrexian Faction Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/phyrexian-faction/144426112262398) to see them.


Now that that's out of the way, let's get down to it.


On the Mirran side, Farris of the Anvil [continues his story](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#!blog,626) in a new field report. There's concept art for [goblin equipment](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#mountains,hotspots;R7;0;) and [red creatures](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#mountains,hotspots;R11;0;). And, of course, there are short flavoriffic snippets scattered throughout the site.


The Phyrexians didn't have a field report this week, but their concept art kept pace with the Mirrans, giving a glimpse of [Auriok equipment](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#plains,hotspots;W5;0;) and [creatures of the Mephidross](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#swamps,hotspots;B5;0;).
