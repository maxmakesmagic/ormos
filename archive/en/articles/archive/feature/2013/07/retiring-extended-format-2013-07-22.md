As the popularity of Modern has continued to rise, Wizards of the Coast has made the decision to retire the Extended format. Too many formats can fracture a player base, so we’ve decided to focus efforts on our other Constructed formats.


Tournament organizers will be able to sanction Extended events up to August 7, 2013, but after that there will be no more sanctioning of events for Extended. Events sanctioned before August 7, 2013, will be able to be run until October 8, 2013.


Magic Online will be removing Extended as a supported format after their downtime on August 7, 2013.
