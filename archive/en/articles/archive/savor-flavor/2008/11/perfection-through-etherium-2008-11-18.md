Perfection through Etherium
===========================



 Posted in **Savor the Flavor**
 on November 18, 2008 









First things first—go read the finale of "[Fuel for the Fire](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/13b)," the Jace and Chandra comic, that appeared on the site today. Then consider judiciously and carefully whether the spell-hurling, adventure-blasting thrill of its eye-delighting graphicality might not just convince you that procuring a theme-relevant copy of [*Duel Decks: Jace vs. Chandra*](/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_jacevschandra_productinfo), now available in your favorite local game store, might not just be a joy-enhancing and immediately implementable idea. Consider!

I thank you, and so does your local gaming store proprietor. 

Now let's talk about Esper.

Constructing the Arc
We thought a lot about the color pie when we were building the underpinnings of the setting that would become *Shards of Alara*. What, for a topical example, do white, blue, and black have in common? What do the parts of that "arc" color trio share that could give Esper its identity? Perhaps the most generative line of thought was about each color in the context of the other two—how each part of the triad influenced the others and drew them away from their usual directions.

White in this context contributes hierarchy, command, and law, bringing the other two colors out of their solipsistic / narcissistic shells and into the realm of society. It adds a theme of striving for enlightenment and perfection to the other colors, a kind of personal virtue filtered through the lens of the other two colors' ethoi. (Er, whatever the plural of ethos is. Belief systems.)
