The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on June 27, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by not spoiling anything from *Game of Thrones* last night. You're safe here. Unlike several characters from last night's episode...


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Top 5 Moments of Grand Prix Pittsburgh](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppit16/top-5-moments-2016-06-26) | [Top 5 Moments of Grand Prix Taipei](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gptai16/top-5-moments-2016-06-26) | Wizards of the Coast | Marc Calderaro and Chapman Sim

Green and white might have been the dominant colors on the weekend, but they weren't the only story. For a quick recap of all that happened at Pittsburgh—including an update on the race for Grand Prix Master, more Steve Rubin dominance, and some very nearly happy news for Pascal Maynard—check out the article above. For full coverage, check out the [Grand Prix Pittsburgh coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppit16). Same deal for Taipei, which had its own effect on the race for Grand Prix Master, a repeat Grand Prix Champion, and a quest for Platinum that got back on track. [Full coverage here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gptai16).


1. [Modern gets diverse](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/250616_dallas.html) | StarCityGames.com Dallas Open

The StarCityGames.com Open this weekend featured Modern for a bit of a change of pace, and the results were fantastically diverse. The Top 8 had seven different archetypes (only Jeskai Control doubled up), and [the Top 32 was just as diverse](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=06/25/2016&end_date=06/26/2016&start=1&finish=32&city=Dallas&limit=32). You can check out coverage of [Day One here](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive/v/74455962) and [Day Two here](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive/v/74647299).


1. [Experience *Magic: The Gathering* Lore Like Never Before! "Under The Silver Moon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrB2tnH3B1A) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor and Shaun Penrod

There have been some attempts at audio versions of [*Magic* Story](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/magic-story-archive), but this latest attempt takes it to a new level, painting the picture with art and producing excellent audio. The voices are incredibly entertaining. If you enjoy *Magic* Story, this is certainly a treat.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Two More *Magic* Stories](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13355&writer=Raphael+Levy&articledate=6-27-2016) | TCGPlayer | Raphaël Lévy

I'm a sucker for stories about playing *Magic*, and you should be too. This one takes a trip down memory lane with Raphaël Lévy—probably the active *Magic* player with the longest such lane, having played at the highest levels virtually since the game's inception. This one covers the joy of Lévy qualifying for the Pro Tour for the first time, and an adorable recount of the subsequent phone call with his mom.


1. [Much Abrew About Nothing: Seismic Swans (Modern)](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/much-abrew-about-nothing-seismic-swans-modern) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

As diverse as Modern is, why not Swans? SaffronOlive takes a run at this fringe Modern deck to see if drawing five cards off of [Swans of Bryn Argoll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swans+of+Bryn+Argoll) plus [Skred](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) is good. (Hint: it's pretty good.)


1. [Fun Finds in Modern!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33163_Fun-Finds-In-Modern.html) | StarCityGames.com | Jennifer Long

I guess today is unofficially Modern day, as Long takes a look at the format as well, combing through *Magic Online* results to dig up some less talked about options for the format. CTRL+F for [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) yielded nothing, so I almost didn't include this article, but it was too interesting to pass up otherwise.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

We dropped the [second episode of Access *Magic* today](http://magic.wizards.com/node/1031626), and it was worth the wait. Debuting meld and the abomination that is Brisela, Voice of Nightmares. Watch this in the light—unless you don't plan to sleep at night. Or if Eldrazi Angel abominations help you sleep, for some reason.


1. > 
> Somehow GP PoY got \*closer\* this weekend?! 2 points each for BBD, Saito, and Reid while Seth gets 3 points to tie Reid for 2nd. 49-49-48-48!

>  — Randy Buehler (@rbuehler) [June 26, 2016](https://twitter.com/rbuehler/status/747181186007474176)

Randy Buehler can't be the only one excited about this. We have an incredibly tight race for one of the World Championship slots, which might just come down to tiebreakers. [Full standings can be found here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/statistics/2015-16-grand-prix-master) (as of this writing, they had not been updated with points from the weekend). Follow along as we come to what's shaping up to be a photo finish.

So if you see anything strange from Rosewater's Twitter feed—well, stranger than normal. If it's not about *Magic*. You know what I mean.


At any rate, the problem should be fixed.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Sultai Midrange in a sea of green white](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppit16/top-8-decklists-2016-06-26)

While white was clearly the dominant color in both Grand Prix this past weekend, a lone soldier in Pittsburgh managed to make the Top 8 without playing white.


Aleksa Telarov, a newly minted Gold-level pro, came backing a Sultai deck of Brad Nelson's design, aiming to beat all of the green and white decks in the field. Packing many of the ubiquitous green cards—[Sylvan Advocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), [Tireless Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), [Nissa, Vastwood Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer), and [her Oath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407650)—Telarov mixed in black removal and blue just for [Dragonlord Silumgar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar).


The deck is definitely on the controlling/midrange spectrum, looking to grind down opponents and power through other creatures with its larger (in stature) force, backed by [Languish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) and a bunch of removal. It even can go up to the full set of [Den Protector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s and [Deathmist Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor)s when it needs to grind the hardest of all.


In the end, Telarov didn't win the title to keep it from the hands of Dromoka, but he still did Silumgar proud.
