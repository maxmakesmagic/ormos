Have your emotions ever gotten the better of you while playing **Magic**? If so, you're not alone. It's common for people of all ages to become frustrated when they lose. Even players on the Pro Tour. They call it "tilt." But these negative emotions can be unpleasant for our opponents and worsen our ability to think strategically. So how can we improve ourselves as gamers? How can we become more gracious in defeat? In Walking the Planes Episode #24, we explore tilt, delve into a fun Block Constructed format, and watch one of **Magic**'s most beloved characters win the trophy that's eluded him for nearly 20 years.
