*Khans of Tarkir* brought us one of the most acclaimed Standard formats in recent memory. In a quest to better understand what mattered and why in this Standard environment, I sat down with some talented planeswalkers and asked, "What card defines the current Standard format?"

***Ben Stark:** "[Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is probably the most powerful card in Standard. Cards like [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) are better in formats like Modern, but [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)'s power adjusted for its casting cost is unmatched in Standard."*

***Valentin Mackl:** "[Temple of Malady](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Malady) is played in a huge portion of the tier one decks. The card fixes mana exactly how we need it to with cards like Sadisi, Brood Tyrant and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) defining the third or fourth turn of most competitive games. The format would likely be very different if it weren't for [Temple of Malady](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Malady)."*
