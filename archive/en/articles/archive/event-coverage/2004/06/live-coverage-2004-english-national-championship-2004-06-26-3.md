Pack 1


Sam quickly settles into drafting a blue affinity deck his opening picks are fairly clear  
 With [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) over Tel-Jilhad Archers, Copperhead Vorrac and [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr), then [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) over [Deconstruct](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct) and [Pearl Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Shard). [Talisman of Dominance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Dominance), a 4th pick [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)!!! And [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) Are all easy choices. Sams sixth pack is derisively weak with [Tree of Tales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tree+of+Tales) clearly being the best card for him. A [Yotian Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier), Cathodian, Banshees Blade and Inertia bubble round out a reasonable set of *Mirrodin* picks for him.


Pack 2


![Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Serum+Visions)
[Quicksilver Behemoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Behemoth) is Sams first pick passing [Essence Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain), Auriok Transmutter and [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff). His second and third picks are clear being [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) and [Arcbound Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher). The next pack is powerful featuring Leonine Bola, Savage Beatdown, [Neurok Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Prodigy) and Vedelken Engineer Sam follows Zvi's school of drafting taking the Leonine Bola (Zvi Stated at U.S. nationals that Bola was Defining in this limited format). After getting [Chromescale Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromescale+Drake), [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker), and Nerok Prodigy. Sam has a choice of [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff), Neurok Transmutter and [Gemini Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemini+Engine). We discussed this pick after the draft, Sam knew he had passed a Transmuter and [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) first pack, this meant his next booster may contain either of these cards. He suspected he would get a Transmutter back and if he did he would rather take the [Gemini Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemini+Engine). He took the Transmutter to be safe, I found this pick interesting as I would probably have taken the [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff). His remaining Picks where the Transmutter which did indeed come back, [Last Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Word) and [Pulse of the Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Grid).


Pack 3


[Rain of Rust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rain+of+Rust) over battered Golem, is Sam's less than inspiring pick although he was reasonably happy here as it was his first piece of artifact removal. He then took two clear picks in [Thought Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Courier) and then a [Rain of Rust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rain+of+Rust) over [Skyreach Manta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta). This gives him a mini Combo with Auriok Transmutter. [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) followed by Quomlux!!!, Sun Touched Myr, [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) over [Solarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solarion) Batton of Courage over Serum Vision and Iron Barbed Helion round out his draft.
