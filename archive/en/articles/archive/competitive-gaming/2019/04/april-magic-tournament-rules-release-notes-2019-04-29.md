*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules Updates
===============================================


Here are the *Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules update notes for the latest release (which can be found [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules)), listed by the section number of the rules. To have more context, you should refer to the actual wording in the document itself.


**General**: Throughout the document, the names of various programs and event types have been deleted, added, or changed as appropriate.


**Section 3.9 (Card Shuffling)**: Clarification added that both players may perform a single pile shuffle on each deck at the beginning of a game.


**Section 4.8 (Reversing Decisions)**: During a team event, a decision may still be reversed if a teammate points out the issue.


**Section 8.2 (Team Composition and Identification)**: Rewritten to make it clear that if a member of a team is disqualified, the entire team is disqualified, and no member of that team will receive prizes or Planeswalker Points for that event.


In addition to these updates to the *Magic* Tournament Rules, a few updates have been made to the Infraction Procedure Guide and the Judging at Regular REL documents. Toby Elliott has a full write-up on these changes in his blog at <https://blogs.magicjudges.org/telliott>.

That's all for this update! If you have questions about *Magic* Tournament Rules, I recommend the following resources:


***Magic: The Gathering*** **Tournament Rules** (viewable [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules))


This is the main rules document that governs competitive tournament play. It defines:


* The fundamentals parts of a tournament;
* The various roles and responsibilities of participants;
* The mechanics of a tournament;
* The violations that come with tournament play;
* The various formats for tournament play; and
* Sanctioning rules.

**Infraction Procedure Guide** (viewable [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide))


This document provides the recommended penalties and procedures to handle rules violations.

I encourage anyone who is interested in tournament-level *Magic* to read these documents. They are the rules under which a tournament is run, so being familiar with these documents can help you become a better player. In some cases, the *Magic* Tournament Rules supersede the *Magic* Game Rules, so knowing these rules can keep you from entering some awkward situations. You can also contact Wizards of the Coast Game Support. Information about how to do that can be found [here](https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2305/).
