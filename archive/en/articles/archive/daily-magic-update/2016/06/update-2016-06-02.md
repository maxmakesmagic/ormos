The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on June 2, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [kickin' it](#mta).


Today's Must
============


1. [This Week's Top 8 Innovations You Need to See](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13312&writer=Adam+Yurchick&articledate=6-2-2016) | TCGPlayer | Adam Yurchick

Of course this is today's must—the title says you need to see these innovations. It's right there in the title!


But it's also in the content. Yurchick points to the leading edges of Standard technology, the fringes ready to break out at a moment's notice. This is exactly what you want out of a strategy article—the latest technology and an explanation for why it does what it does.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Tuning White-Black Control](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/tuning-bw-control/) | ChannelFireball | Owen Turtenwald

The No. 2 ranked player in the world took Black-White Control, made a few important swaps, and ran all the way to the Top 8 of [Grand Prix Minneapolis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmin16). No tournament report, but he does touch on why he made what changes, and gives a complete sideboarding guide.


1. [The Best Deck in Standard](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/emmahandy-06022016-the-best-deck-in-standard/) | Gathering Magic | Emma Handy

Green-White Tokens is probably the best deck in Standard, even if it's far from the only game in town. Still, it deserves special attention. Like, a full article of attention. Emma Handy gives it that long look and delves deep into what makes Green-White Tokens tick—and how to defeat it.


1. [A Guide to Building Deck and Gameplay on *Magic: The Gathering Online*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpD6R9VyD9M) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

In the second video in the series, The Professor tackles teaching *Magic Online*. It's a solid tool for anyone who has dabbled or thought about dabbling in online play. There's even minimal snark! Which is either a feature or a bug in this video, depending on what kind of Tolarian Community College videos you enjoy.

1. [Hey Bro, Let's Kick It! "The Day 2 Crew" *Magic: The Gathering* Video Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYQMUmoAVWg) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

This meanwhile, I just...I don't...how...what...?


So, Steve and Steve (aka Meghan and Maria) host "Hey Bro, Let's Kick It!" and they kick it about *Magic: The Gathering* and the Grand Prix. Plus they punch grandma—in, like, a loving way. And they say "bro" a lot.

1. [Against the Odds: Coalition Victory](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-coalition-victory) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

More like Coalition Crushing Defeat, am I right? Hello? Jokes?


Another seemingly impossible task in Against the Odds, another instance of the odds proving the victor. But it's worth watching just to see the few (the very, very few) moments when the combo comes together.


[Coalition Victory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Victory): not even once.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

> Suspended DCI Memberships | MAGIC: THE GATHERING <https://t.co/VyE8U3BWiF>

>  — Helene Bergeot (@HeleneBergeot) [June 1, 2016](https://twitter.com/HeleneBergeot/status/738142195836846080)

Surprising almost no one, Fabrizio Anteri was suspended [after his disqualification for deck manipulation](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpman16/fabrizio-anteri-disqualified-grand-prix-manchester-2016-05-28) at [Grand Prix Manchester](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpman16). This has several implications, not least of which is that there's a new leader for the [Grand Prix Master standings](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/statistics/2015-16-grand-prix-master). [Hélène Bergeot also clarified](https://twitter.com/HeleneBergeot/status/738166106033033216) that he would not be eligible for any end-of-season awards or World Championship slots.


Naturally, Reddit jumped on this, so you can view or participate in the [discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4m43xj/fabrizio_anteri_suspended_until_20171201/). Or you can just bask in how great [Reid Duke's reaction](https://twitter.com/ReidDuke/status/738146364211634177) was to suddenly being thrust right back in the thick of the Grand Prix Master race.


1. [Hadn't seen any strong evidence backing the *Eldritch Moon*/Phyrexians theory, but this actually makes a TON of sense...](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4m2lh1/hadnt_seen_any_strong_evidence_backing_the/)

The latest theory on the cause of madness of Innistrad that has caught fire points to the Phyrexians. [One Tumblr user spotted some text from *Magic Story*](http://ajanigoldmane.tumblr.com/post/145123748191/eldritch-moon-phyrexia) that convinced them that the Phyrexians were involved, and the Internet responded. Many, like in the thread above, found merit in the theory. Others, like Cary Thomas Barkett (Gathering Magic's flavor writer) [had other opinions](https://twitter.com/Vronos/status/738231273605500928).


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Community Super League—No Banned List Modern](https://communitysuperleague.com/csl-schedule/)

Community Super League takes off again tonight with No Banned List Modern, where, um, they play Modern. And there's no banned list in effect. It's pretty self-explanatory there.


Catch the off-the-wall action starting at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET tonight, and learn why some cards are better left un-unbanned.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Mono-Blue Prison](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpman16/mono-blue-prison-with-martin-muller-2016-05-28)

Those are not words I ever thought I'd type again, but here we are. Martin Müller conjured up a mono-blue deck that delays, waylays, and sashays its way to victory. A slow, steady, eventual, grindy victory.


I tried this deck out yesterday to get a feel for it, and it was—good?


The gist of it is this: use [Prism Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Ring) to stay alive early and claw back late, gaining 1 life from just about everything you cast. [Jace's Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Sanctum) lets you pull ahead on mana in the mid- and late game when you're casting multiple spells per turn, and [Pore Over the Pages](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pore+Over+the+Pages) lets you tear through your deck at a discount (often discarding [Nagging Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagging+Thoughts)). [Engulf the Shore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore) resets the board at instant speed and, thanks to all of your lands being Islands, hits pretty much anything from turn four on.


Once you get going, [Part the Waterveil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Part+the+Waterveil) and [Rise from the Tides](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) provide your win conditions.


But there's a lot more play to this than there seems at first glance. For instance, [Engulf the Shore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore) into [Day's Undoing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day%27s+Undoing) acts as something of a Wrath effect, shuffling creatures away. Only one [Rise from the Tides](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) is generally needed, as [Day's Undoing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day%27s+Undoing) can recycle it.


The deck isn't great against discard that exiles, namely [Thought-Knot Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) and [Transgress the Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind), but it seems to actually just destroy creature strategies otherwise. Plus, it hits from an angle that few people see coming.


Though, trust me, you're going to give them plenty of time to figure out what's going on. Just make sure you're not a slow player if you'd like to pick this up.
