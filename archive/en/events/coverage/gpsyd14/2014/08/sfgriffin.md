 Paul Jackson's been having a great weekend so far. A pretty awesome one, in fact. Aside from making his very first Grand Prix Top 8, he seems to have put together an excellent White/Blue deck. Its highlight and cornerstone would most likely be [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward), one of the top rares of the format.




 With [Heliod's Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Pilgrim), Jackson had doubled his chances of drawing the powerful bomb. Jackson even had a third way to fetch it, going one step further to include [Boonweaver Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boonweaver+Giant).



Matthew Griffin's claim to fame was a third place finish at New Zealand Nationals back in 2009. Since then, he has competed in three lifetime Pro Tours and will be attending his fourth at Honolulu very soon.


His Black Green deck seemed to be the perfect attrition machine. Not quite very speedy at all, but superbly powerful in the late game.



 A pair of [Roaring Primadox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roaring+Primadox) and [Invasive Species](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invasive+Species) would go nicely with [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) and [Rotfeaster Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotfeaster+Maggot), while [Cruel Sadist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Sadist), [Xathrid Slyblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Slyblade) and [Caustic Tar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Tar) could be backbreaking if left unchecked.




**Game One**




 Jackson pressured with [Soulmender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulmender), [Kinsbaile Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Skirmisher) and [Research Assistant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Research+Assistant), quickly dishing a few damage.




 Griffin was forced to mulligan his initial seven but was able to cough up [Netcaster Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Netcaster+Spider), [Invasive Species](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invasive+Species) and [Xathrid Slyblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Slyblade).






*Matt Griffin's mulligan could have been worse.*

  

 Despite having [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits), Jackson was unable to mount a profitable offense, largely due to the rather annoying spider.



The stalemate soon came to an abrupt end though.



 Jackson suited up his [Kinsbaile Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Skirmisher) with [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) and the four-turn clock commenced.




 Having no solutions in his maindeck to an untargetable, unblockable 4/4, Griffin tried to race, but [Soulmender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulmender) had cushioned Jackson's life total to a point where that plan was out of the window.



Carefully chumping with his creatures (mostly tokens) to preserve his life total, Jackson was able to get to the finish line within the next four turns.



**Paul Jackson 1 - Matthew Griffin 0**




 Jackson was the aggressor once again, curving out beautifully with [Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar), [Sungrace Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sungrace+Pegasus) and [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits).




 That's one nasty air force but Griffin had the appropriate trumps, namely [Cruel Sadist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Sadist) and [Netcaster Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Netcaster+Spider).




 Now that the board was gummed up, he added [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm) to the board, prompting Jackson to offer the trade with [Nimbus of the Isles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+of+the+Isles) and [Preeminent Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preeminent+Captain).




 Or not. [Ephemeral Shields](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephemeral+Shields) kept [Nimbus of the Isles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+of+the+Isles) alive and Jackson could finally start counter-attacking.




 But the game was slipping away for Jackson and it didn't seem like a 3/3 flyer was enough to do the trick. [Cruel Sadist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Sadist) picked off his creatures one by one. [Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar) was the first to bite the dust, followed by [Razorfoot Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin).




[Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity) refilled Jackson's hand. Suddenly, a glimmer of hope had surfaced.




[Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward).




 Despite seeing all of Griffin's mana untapped, Jackson decided to take the shot and tried to put [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) on [Nimbus of the Isles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+of+the+Isles).




 Griffin showed him [Flesh to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+to+Dust).




 The audience gasped. [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) had fizzled and it looked like a devastating blowout.



Was it over for Jackson? Not quite yet.





*Paul Jackson's not done yet.*

  

[Boonweaver Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boonweaver+Giant) made its dramatic entrance, picking up [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) from the grave.




 Was it over for Griffin? Not quite yet. He was ready with a sideboarded [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize).




 Unfortunately for Griffin, Jackson had the last laugh when he used [Peel from Reality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peel+from+Reality) to unsummon [Boonweaver Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boonweaver+Giant).



The game was now in its final throes. With only one turn more to live and his opponent at 7 life, Griffin mounted an all-out attack.



 Jackson could still lose the game if he failed to block correctly, but that wasn't about to happen. He deftly allowed only [Netcaster Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Netcaster+Spider) to get past and Griffin's [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) was insufficient to deal the lethal blow.




**Paul Jackson 2 - Matthew Griffin 0**



Paul Jackson defeats Matthew Griffin and advances to the finals!
