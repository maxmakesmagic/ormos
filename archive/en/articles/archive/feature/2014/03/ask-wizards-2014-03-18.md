Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!


 **Q: What interesting, infinite combos are there in Standard today? While they might not be competitive I think that they are the most fun to construct and play with. â€”Shiftrex**  


**A: Mike McArtor, copy editor for DailyMTG:** 


Here are a few to chew on:


Shortly after *Theros* released, Gavin Verhey [presented one in ReConstructed](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/266).


Later, he wrote about [another one](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/274)! That same week, Mike Cannon presented two different takes [on that idea as well](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/274). It's apparently a popular combo.


Jacob Van Lunen got in on the fun as well, [once *Born of the Gods* released](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/pr/284).


Enjoy!
