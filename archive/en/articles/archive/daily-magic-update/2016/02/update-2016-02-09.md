The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 9, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Wayne England](#england). He will be missed.


Today's Must
============


1. [MTG—Intermediate Cube Construction—A Guide For Developing *Magic: The Gathering* Cubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc0I6wG6O1c) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

The Professor moves on to the intermediate level of Cube construction. If you've ever had an interest in building a cube, the Professor can show you how. But if you're not familiar with cubes or want to start from the beginning, check out his other videos on [what Cube is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNDBTRG6keM&feature=youtu.be) and [how to build your first cube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoL9dKWcwG8&feature=youtu.be).


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/zc0I6wG6O1c>


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*: By the Meta](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/pro-tour-oath-of-the-gatewatch-by-the-meta) | MTGGoldfish | Saffron Olive

Saffron Olive breaks down *all* of the numbers—and we do mean all of them—from [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptogw). I won't tell you what the focus of the article ends up being, but it rhymes with schmeldrazi.


Oh, and you can check out his [initial companion pieces posted yesterday](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/pro-tour-ogw-eldrazi-winners-and-decks) for even more in-depth analysis of Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*. For some reason, there's very little talk of [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). I'm sure it was a simple oversight.


1. [Modern Power Rankings](http://www.channelfireball.com/power-rankings/) | ChannelFireball

In the wake of the Pro Tour, ChannelFireball has updated their Modern Power Rankings and, no surprise, it's Eldrazi-dominated. But, really, who saw [Drowner of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) coming?


1. [League Play: Playing Izzet Tron in Pauper](http://puremtgo.com/articles/league-play-playing-izzet-tron-pauper) | PureMTGO.com | Joshua Claytor

Modern gets all the press, the glamour, and the party invites, but Pauper had a key card banned recently too! While I doubt we'll get the mountain of analysis that came out of the Pro Tour when it comes to how Pauper has been affected, a number of players are trying their hand at exploring the new format, including Claytor and Alex Ullman, [who also adds to the Pauperstravaganza at PureMTGO.com today](http://puremtgo.com/articles/painful-truths-and-impulse).


1. [Fat Stacks—Kalitas, the TR8R!](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13110&writer=Cassidy+Silver&articledate=2-9-2016) | TCGPlayer.com | Cassidy Silver

Cassidy Silver writes one of the most consistent Commander columns around, and his latest deck highlights one of the breakout cards of *Oath of the Gatewatch*, [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). And since all Kalitas wants is a hug, I would feel bad not highlighting this article. He just wants your love.


But if you want something a little Spikier, you can also check out the [Narset, Enlightened Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master) [video from CMDR Decks](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/cmdrdecks-020816-narset-enlightened-master/), posted today.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Wayne England—artist of cards such as Cryptic Command—passed away this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/44x7od/wayne_england_artist_of_cards_such_as_cryptic/)

Some sad news this morning, as one of *Magic*'s most beloved artists passed away this morning. Fans from all corners of the fantasy art world are mourning his passing, and you can see many people sharing their favorite Wayne England art—from *Magic* or from other realms—on Twitter using the hashtag [#wayneengland](https://twitter.com/hashtag/wayneengland).


1. [Clash Packs and Event Decks Canceled](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/138965504313/ogw-didnt-have-an-event-deck-or-clash-pack-and)

Mark Rosewater confirmed this today, and I can confirm his confirmation. We have a ton of creative people in the building who are all constantly brainstorming new products and new ways to present old products to create the best experiences for, well, you. And me. And anyone who plays *Magic*. One of the many fun things about *Magic* is that there are virtually infinite ways to play the game, and shifts in our offerings from time-to-time reflect that.

If you're interested in Modern, this offers a wealth of data to pair with all of those numbers Saffron threw at you above.

Mark Rosewater continues his fun series of head-to-head votes with the question we've all been asking ourselves for the past 20 years: [Red Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast) or [Pyroblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast)?

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Casting a Shadow over Modern](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptogw/21-23-point-modern-decklists-2016-02-07)

While it might not have gotten the same press as those otherworldly beings that cast a shadow over everything, [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) certainly put on quite the show in Modern this past weekend. Highlighted by Joel Larsson's 7-3 performance with it, and strong finishes by several other players as well, this deck is crazy fast and quite strong. The point is to play a one-mana creature early—[Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), [Monastery Swiftspear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear), and [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) will do, but [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) can be the real payoff—and then finish your opponent with a combination of [Become Immense](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) and [Temur Battle Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage), all fueled by virtually free spells that cost life, growing [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow). It's a risky strategy, but certainly one that paid off for a number of players.
