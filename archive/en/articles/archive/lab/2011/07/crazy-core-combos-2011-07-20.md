Excuse that blight of a title. When the dog days of summer get to me like they are currently, I tend to be irritable and bored. Oh sorry, I'm supposed to fall into my usual programming and welcome everyone back to the column. My bad. I enjoy breaking in and out of this **Magic**al Matrix. You would too, if you were the One. (PS: Flying is awesome.)

Welcome back to the Lab, ladies and gents. This week it appears to be none other than Core Set Weekâ€”an apt choice, considering ***Magic** 2012* was unleashed to the public quite recently.

With such a wide palette to choose from today, I thought I'd start out by delivering a slight history lesson, something I'm prone to doing from time to time. Only four years ago, **Magic** was radically different. There were no such things as planeswalkers or mythic rares or core sets with new material. Back in my day, mana was so wild and primal that it hurt you occasionally! Those were the days.

Now, though, **Magic** has gone through a sudden warp and emerged from the other side as a sleek (or sleeker) machine with the same game mechanics nestled within. In other words, a reboot. I certainly don't imply any heavy negative connotations here. Only light ones. Reboots are great when implemented effectively (example: *Casino Royale*). However, too much rotating of the formula can knock the rebooted subject off of its new hinges (in a bad way; example: *Quantum of Solace*). While the next Bond movie still exists only in the Infinite (and it better deliver, but no pressure), I'm happy to say that **Magic** has for the most part continued on a steady and fun course.
