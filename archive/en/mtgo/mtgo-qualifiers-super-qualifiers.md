MTGO Qualifiers & Super Qualifiers
----------------------------------


After collecting at least 40 QPs over the course of the season, the next step is to find the Premier Play event that is right for you. There are several options from which to choose:


(This Page) Qualifiers and Super Qualifiers  
[MOCS Showcase Challenges & Last Chance Events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/mocs-step-1-showcase-challenges-last-chance-events)


**NOTES**:


* Each event in *Magic Online* has a maximum number of players *(as indicated below)* and events at the end of each season are likely to have more players. Once an event fills, no further entries will be allowed, so plan your QP usage accordingly.
* Players must be at least age 13 to play *Magic Online*. Players under age 18 on the date of the qualifying event are permitted to win digital prizes but are ineligible to be awarded invitations to Championships or the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase.
* Players already invited to the next Championship remain eligible to compete in Qualifiers, Super Qualifiers, and Champions Showcase events unless otherwise noted.
* Should an already invited or ineligible player win a redundant Championship invitation, that invite will pass down to the next highest placed eligible player.
