![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a743.jpg)What can you say about Kai Budde that hasn't been said before? Smut peddler! The best player in Magic history is using barely clothed model cards as [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) tokens today, for either his own amusement, to distract his opponents, or to entertain spectators. Budde and his opponent Jens Thoren are two of Europe's best, and at 10-3 have a good shot at making Top 8, especially with a win here. Thoren is playing Sligh while Budde has Reanimator, so the games should be quick one way or another.

### Game 1

Thoren played and tapped a mountain, as Budde wondered, "Lackey?" Unfortunately for Thoren it was merely a [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), and Budde declared, "You are weak" in his unmistakable German accent. [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) put [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) into the graveyard, and it hit play on turn two thanks to [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume). He played Contaminaton on turn three, and smiled. "It's always good to have one of those in the maindeck."

Thoren- 0 Budde- 1

### Game 2

Thoren mulliganed down to four, as Thoren's disbelief and Budde's slightly uncomfortable laughter increased every time Thoren sent his hand back. He opened with a Prospector, and Kai cast [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) with a laugh, seeing [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) and [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). Both came out, and after an attack, Thoren sacrificed both his Goblins to bring out [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander).

Budde- "Not bad for a four card hand."

It didn't matter much, as Budde had [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) and [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) to get [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) into play with [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume), and [Vendetta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendetta) killed off the Commander. 

**Final Result:** Thoren- 0 Budde- 2
