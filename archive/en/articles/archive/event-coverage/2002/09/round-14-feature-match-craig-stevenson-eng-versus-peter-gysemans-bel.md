Those of you who read all the coverage available will have seen the deck tech article on the mono-black metagame deck called Pirates. The deck is still present on the top tables and here Craig Stevenson is trying to pilot it into the top eight. Peter is playing a white weenie Punisher type deck with a few rogue changes. It’s probably fair to say that you would have got long odds on these two decks playing off for a top eight spot.

Game One

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/902.jpg)Craig started with a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), revealing land, two [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation)s, [Beloved Chaplain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beloved+Chaplain), [Tireless Tribe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe), [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech), and [Spurnmage Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spurnmage+Advocate). Not such a bad draw, and Craig took the Chaplain. Peter got three [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) into his graveyard with [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation).

Stevenson didn’t have a third land, so he just played a [Zombie Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) and attacked with the Fiend. Peter made a [Tireless Tribe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe). At the end of his turn Craig made a Zombie discarding [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) and [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). The [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid), Zombie and Fiend swung in after the Tribe was Edicted. This put Peter down to only ten. Gysemans cast [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech) and passed the turn. Craig attacked once more and a bird traded with [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid); two Zombie tokens knocking Peter to six.

His position was sufficiently precarious that Peter cast [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) for [Prismatic Strands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands) and dropped a [Beloved Chaplain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beloved+Chaplain), which bought him some time. The next attack was fogged, giving Peter chance to drop a [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech) and a [Spurnmage Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spurnmage+Advocate). He started to flashback the Screeches, and because of the [Beloved Chaplain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beloved+Chaplain), Craig could no longer attack with his creatures. After all four Screeches were flashed back and Peter started to fly across, Stevenson scooped.

Game Two

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/903.jpg)Peter had to take a mulligan, as he had drawn two [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory), four land, and a [Confessor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confessor). His second draw was a lot better though. Peter played first turn Tribe, and second turn [Beloved Chaplain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beloved+Chaplain). The Tribe was murdered by a [Slithery Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slithery+Stalker), but Peter followed up with a second Chaplain and another Chaplain. There’s no doubt that these are the best creature for the match up. 

Gysemans played a [Divine Sacrament](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Sacrament) and then a third Chaplain. One of the Chaplains was killed with [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), but the situation looked bad for him. Luckily for the Englishman, he had a [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate), which cleared the board completely. 

Stevenson used [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) to kill off a [Confessor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confessor), and began to beat down. Peter was stuck with only one Plains in play, and he needed a second for [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech) in his hand. Although he had three or four turns to draw it, he was unable to do so and the [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) won the game for the Englishman

Game Three

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/904.jpg)They began the game with only around fifteen minutes left in the round, and with a draw knocking them both out of contention. The Belgian had a no-land hand and had to take a mulligan. 

Peter played a second turn [Spurnmage Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spurnmage+Advocate) and a third turn [Phantatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantatog), whereas the English player used [Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) to [Accelerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accelerate) himself into a third turn [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids). Peter had a poor draw, with multiple [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech)es, and without any creatures to cast, he found himself locked in an anticlimatic end to a good match.
