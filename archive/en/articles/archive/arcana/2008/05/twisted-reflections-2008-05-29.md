As you might have heard once or twice, *Shadowmoor* is like the dark reflection of *Lorwyn*. And that's played out in a few key *Shadowmoor* cards that were concepted as explicit mirrors of *Lorwyn* cards. But (like all reflections, really), they're reversed.

### Balloonists and Harpoonists

In *Lorwyn*, the [Kinsbaile Balloonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Balloonist) flies around, cheerfully giving other creatures rides through the air. Flip the switch, and you get the much less friendly [Kinscaer Harpoonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinscaer+Harpoonist) shooting them out of the sky.

Here's the [Kinsbaile Balloonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Balloonist). Click on the "Darken" button to *Shadowmoor* it up.

Not all of the "mirror" cards are strict mechanical flip-flops. Rhys, the legendary elf, appears in both *Morningtide* and *Shadowmoor* as two cards with linked flavor and art, although his abilities aren't linked so closely.

| Rhys the Exiled | Rhys the Redeemed |

This time, since Rhys isn't "redeemed" until Shadowmoor, we're starting with the darker one.

Probably the purest reflection is between *Lorwyn*'s [Incremental Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Growth) and *Shadowmoor*'s [Incremental Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Blight):

While we're on the subject of "dark reflections", we thought we'd mention that from time to time, cards get new art that can change the mood of the card dramatically. Consider the case of the Bog Wraith:
