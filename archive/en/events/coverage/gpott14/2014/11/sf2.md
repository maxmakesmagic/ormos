 Neal Oliver is armed with a [Secret Plans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secret+Plans) deck while his opponent, Xavier Allegrucci, had an aggressive Temur tempo strategy.




 In the first game, both players developed their boards, but Allegrucci was far ahead with [Pine Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pine+Walker) and [Longshot Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longshot+Squad) to Oliver's pair of morphs. When Allegrucci tried to use [Awaken the Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awaken+the+Bear) to run over Oliver, who was stuck on three lands, Oliver had [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away) to stay in the tempo game. Eventually, Oliver started drawing lands and Allegrucci found himself in a situation where his opponent had a lot more cards to work with.
