As a core set, *Tenth Edition* brings back some old favorite cards and gives them a new mission: teach new players the themes of the five colors, enable new kinds of decks with subtle changes since the last core set, and in some cases, show new perspectives on classic spells with all-new art.


The new art for [Robe of Mirrors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Robe+of+Mirrors) goes a different direction from the original *Exodus* version. Instead of a literal robe fitted with shiny surfaces, the *Tenth Edition* version represents the slipperiness of the shroud mechanic by showing repeated (mirrored) copies of the spellcaster—an enemy pyromancer will have no idea where to aim his [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock).

[Overgrowth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrowth) had two pieces of prior art—the *Stronghold* version shows the roots of mangrove-like trees in Skyshroud, and the *Ninth Edition* printing shows a tree generating glowing green energy. In *Tenth Edition*, we see a tree that has grown to ridiculous proportions—so overgrown that each of its fruits are themselves entire forests.

[Hurkyl's Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurkyl%27s+Recall), first printed in *Antiquities*, has had the same art since that first printing. The *Tenth Edition* version moves away from depicting Hurkyl herself, and instead shows two [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut)s (also reappearing in *Tenth*) boiling away into the aether.
