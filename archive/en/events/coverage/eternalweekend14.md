### **DELVE THROUGH ETERNAL WEEKEND**


Its been an exciting weekend, with new cards like Dig Through Time and Treasure Cruise making a huge impact in the eternal scene!





















[VINTAGE COVERAGE](#none)

[LEGACY COVERAGE](#none)




VINTAGE COVERAGE
----------------


And so concludes the 2014 Vintage Championship. This weekend, we’ve seen delve cards like Treasure Cruise and Dig Through Time drastically change the eternal formats. 341 players came to the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia this morning with dreams of being the 2014 Vintage Champion. After nine rounds of swiss, only eight remained. The dust settled and Mark Tocco’s Oath of Druids deck came out on top after one of the most impressive game starts we’ve seen all weekend. Black Lotus and Forbidden Orchard powered out Time Walk and Oath of Druids to find Griselbrand to end the tournament in explosive fashion. Congratulations to Mark Tocco, your 2014 Vintage Championship winner!
