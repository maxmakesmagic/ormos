The *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) [page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers) has been updated with a schedule for Pro Tour *Kaladesh* PTQs! There, you'll be able to find a schedule of *Magic Online* PTQs that could net you an invitation to Pro Tour *Kaladesh*!




---

What is the Pro Tour?
=====================


The *Magic: The Gathering* Pro Tour is a tournament series where legends are born. With four annual worldwide stops, the *Magic* Pro Tour is the premier circuit to play competitive *Magic*. Each event showcases a prize pool of $250,000.


Learn more about the Pro Tour [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-magic-event-types-events).




---

How do I qualify for the Pro Tour through *Magic Online*?
=========================================================


With *Magic Online*, you can qualify for the Pro Tour from the comfort of your own home via *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier events!




---

You can find information on face-to-face PTQ events [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/regionalqualifiers).




---

*Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers (PTQs) consist of a set of PTQ Preliminaries that grant tokens that can be used to enter a PTQ Finals event. Winners of PTQ Finals receive invitations to an upcoming Pro Tour as well as its associated Pro Tour Challenge.


*Magic Online* hosts sixteen Pro Tour Qualifier Finals following each set of PTQ Preliminaries. PTQ Preliminaries grant Constructed and Limited tokens of two different colors, **red** and **blue**. Constructed PTQ Preliminaries award only Constructed tokens, and Limited PTQ Preliminaries only award Limited tokens. Similarly, you can only use Constructed entry tokens to join Constructed PTQ Finals, and you can only use Limited entry tokens to join Limited PTQ Finals. Players may participate in as many PTQ Preliminaries as they like and earn as many tokens as they'd like. PTQ Finals tokens can't be transferred.

Speaking of **red** and **blue** tokens, Pro Tour Qualifiers for *Kaladesh* will switch to awarding **red** Pro Tour Qualifier Tokens. *Kaladesh* Pro Tour Qualifier Finals will accept either **red** tokens or the **blue** tokens from the Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* PTQ season. Following the *Kaladesh* PTQ season, **blue** tokens will be removed from player accounts, so make sure to use them this season if you've been hanging onto them! **Please note, the **red** tokens that are currently in player collections will be removed during the June 1 downtime, following the PT *Eldritch Moon* PTQ season.**


Once a player qualifies for the Pro Tour through a *Magic Online* Championship Series Season Final, or a *Magic Online* PTQ, s/he is no longer eligible to participate in either face-to-face or *Magic Online* PTQ Events that lead to the same Pro Tour. Refer to the [*Magic: The Gathering* Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/wpn/document.aspx?x=magic_the_gathering_premier_event_invitation_policy) for more event eligibility requirements and rules.


The full schedule can be found below. **Be careful when planning out which PTQs you'd like to attend as some PTQ Finals are not scheduled for their usual days (some Limited PTQ Finals are now on Saturday instead of always being on Sunday and some Constructed Finals are now on Sundays).** You can learn more about qualifying for Pro Tour *Kaladesh*, as well as get the full schedule, on the *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier [page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers).
