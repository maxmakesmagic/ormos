**U.S. Nationals 1999 Reports**
-------------------------------

   
Round 5 Feature Match
---------------------



**Randy Buehler vs Rudy Edwards** 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/USNAT99/images/R5Buehler.JPG)Edwards 
 and Buehler, both players with extensive grapevine connections, 
 were each 3-1 coming into this, the second to last round of the 
 day. Game one started quickly, with Rudy dropping a first turn Wild 
 Dogs, which he followed up with a second turn Priest of Titania 
 and a third turn Treefolk Mystic. On the other side of the table, 
 Randy was in the process of drawing four of his seven Islands while 
 failing to find a second black source, with which he could cast 
 one of his three Eradicates. 


Second game was all Buehler as he dropped a second turn Phyrexian 
 Denouncer and a third turn Looming Shade, but Rudy had been holding 
 back a Miscalculation, so the Shade didn't get through. 


After Edwards dropped a Marker Beetle, Randy solidified his defence 
 with an Unworthy dead, a Fog of Gnats and a Spawning Pool, after 
 which he Intervened a Disappear and Snaped the Mysic in response 
 to Rudy casting Rancor. The begining of the end came when Randy 
 Eradicated two times -- with a Vile Requiem in play. The game ended 
 with the third in his hand. 


Game three was all Randy as a mana flooded Edwards dropped Forest 
 after Forest. Rudy's first creature was a Yavamaya Wurm, which was 
 immediately Eradicated, and when his Metathran Elite was Swatted 
 with the Requiem in play, he was ready to concede. Buehler goes 
 to 4-1, putting him in good shape for the standard portion, in which 
 he went 6-0 last year.
