Eight rounds and 1,734 players later and just 10 players were left vying for 9-0 at the end of a brisk Day 1. All 10 occupied the top five tables, so we checked in on each match to see who rolls into Sunday with momentum, and who had to settle for a still impressive 8-1 finish.


**Table 1 Stu Somers (Mono Black Devotion) vs. Dean Bilz (Bant Control)**


Stu Somers worked his [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) to perfection in two back and forth games, breaking through in the first match thanks to a timely [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) on Elspeth tokens that were needed to keep Bilz alive. The second game was much faster, but involved just as many lands tapping to draw cards.

After two blink-and-you'll-miss-it games, the two ran into something of stalemate in the third game. A [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) kept one Gray Merchant from gaining any ground, but a second sealed the deal. Cortes actually would have won on the spot if he had a second white mana, but with Seifert at 7 life and both [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) and [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix) in hand, Cortes came up just short.


**Table 3 David Ochoa (Br Devotion) vs. Kyle Boggemes (Esper Control)**


David Ochoa's Br Devotion deck put up quite a fight, especially after a day of destroying other Azorius-flavored decks, but in the end a pair of [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm)s put Boggemes through to Day 2. Flipping both an [Erebos, God of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead) and a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) to the top of Ochoa's deck, Boggemes gave himself enough room for both [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) and [Ã†therling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) to do the rest.

**Table 4 Jeffrey Pyka (Uw Devotion) vs. Paul Woo (Rw Devotion)**


Pyka knew his Blue deck would be good against Woo, but he didn't know just how true his blue would do. Rhyming aside, Blue Devotion is pretty good against Red Devotion, and [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) and [Domestication](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domestication) featured prominently in elevating Pyka to 9-0.


**Table 5 No. 11 Alexander Hayne vs. Louis Kaplan**


Look, Louis Kaplan is a good **Magic**ian. I used to play with him back in my Iowa days at the same stores as No. 16 Josh McClain. His 8-0 run today surprised approximately no one who actually knows him. But he played against Alexander Hayne, who is as good a bet as anyone these days, especially piloting a close approximation of the deck he won Grand Prix Vancouver with, like, yesterday. Let's not say we didn't see it coming when he wins his 4th GP in a year this weekend. You heard it here first.


Sorry Louis, but he's Alexander Hayne, and he's now 9-0.

*No. 11 Alexander Hayne took on all comers today, including a hooded Louis Kaplan, and stands at 9-0.*
