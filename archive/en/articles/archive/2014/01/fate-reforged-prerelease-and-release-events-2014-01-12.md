Fate Reforged Prerelease and Release Events

Everyone's favorite Dragonspeaker, Sarkhan, has travelled into the past to do some timeline meddling. Now, you can follow in Sarkhan's journey through time as he embarks on a quest to change Tarkir's present and re-introduce dangerous, flying, elemental lizards into the ecosystem. That's right, *Fate Reforged* is almost here, and that means Prerelease and Release Events on *Magic Online* are coming up. Explore the roots of your favorite clan! See how things were on Tarkir back when dragons ruled the roost! Whatever you do, don't bother questioning Sarkhan's judgment on this oneâ€”he's really into dragons.


[Prerelease Events](#prerelease) begin Friday, January 30, at 10:00 a.m. and run until Monday, February 2, at 10:00 a.m. *Magic Online* players will have a chance to see how *Fate Reforged* handles in a Draft with the [Prerelease Swiss Draft](#preswissdraft), or you can choose your clan and pick up the associated "Battle" Prerelease object to compete in two varieties of Prerelease Sealed Events going on throughout the weekend: [Competitive](#precompetitivesealed) and [Friendly](#prefriendlysealed). The Friendly Prerelease Sealed Event allows players to explore how Tarkir has changed in a more leisurely setting. The Competitive Prerelease Sealed Event is for a fiercer breed of warrior, but rewards those who come out on top with a steeper prize payout.


When you enter one of the Prerelease Sealed Events, you will receive four regular packs of *Fate Reforged*, one special seeded *Fate Reforged* booster, and one *Khans of Tarkir* booster pack. The seeded booster contains a run of commons and uncommons from the clan corresponding to your selected "Battle" object, as well as one foil rare or mythic rare that is also associated with your chosen clan. Once you crack them open, the last step is assembling the best deck possible from your available forces. Participation in any Prerelease Event will reward players with a Yasova Dragonclaw avatar. Unlike our time-travelling friend Sarkhan, the rest of us can't go back in time to catch these events, so mark your calendars!





To show the parallels between Tarkir's past and present, all Prerelease Events, as well as the majority of Release Events, will utilize both *Fate Reforged* and *Khans of Tarkir* boosters. Those of you who want a pure *Fate Reforged* experience will get your chance in the Triple *Fate Reforged* 4-3-2-2 Release Draft Queues.




[Release Events](#release) begin after the Prerelease comes to a close at 10:00 a.m. Monday, February 2, and run until the downtime on Wednesday, February 18. Release Queue events run on demand and will be available for the duration of the Release. Make sure to keep your eye out for the two scheduled Release events, the [64-Player with Top 8 Draft](#64playerdraft) and the [Swiss Sealed with Top 8](#swisssealed) Events. Participating in any Release Event will earn you either a Yasova Dragonclaw avatar, or Ugin, the Spirit Dragon avatar for your collection!
