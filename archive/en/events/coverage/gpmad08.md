Grand Prix Madrid 2008
----------------------


Nørgaard Withers to Victory in Madrid
=====================================




July 26 - 27, 2008












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad08/end_blurb.jpg)


Lasse Nørgaard is the winner of Grand Prix Madrid 2008!


In the quarterfinals the player from Denmark first dispatched Geir Bakke from Norway and his monoblue deck. Then in the semifinals Nørgaard went up against the favorite, Swiss pro Manuel Bucher and his nearly mono-colored green deck, and still he prevailed.


Finally, the finals: In the battle against hometown hero Daniel Martin Bermejo, Nørgaard's deck and its withering capabilities saw him through a war of attrition. This story is finished but the understanding of the brand-new draft format is just at the beginning. This weekend we've seen mono-colored decks, different takes on draft archetypes, and a variety of strategies -- from the most extreme form of control to ultra-aggressive weenie decks. As the **Magic**  year is heading towards Nationals , we are sure to see more of that in the near future!
