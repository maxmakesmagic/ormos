All-Access Weeks, Plus Week of Super Qualifiers
-----------------------------------------------


Escape the January doldrums with a Week of Super Qualifiers starting Monday, January 18—one per day for an entire week! Each event offers TWO invitations to the *Kaldheim* Championship on *MTG Arena*.


*(For UTC, add 8 hours)*





| DATE | TIME (PT) | EVENT |
| Tuesday, January 19, 2021 | 3:00 p.m. | Pioneer Super Qualifier |
| Wednesday, January 20, 2021 | 5:00 a.m. | Standard Super Qualifier |
| Thursday, January 21, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Legacy Super Qualifier |
| Friday, January 22, 2021 | 2:00 p.m. | Modern Super Qualifier |
| Saturday, January 23, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Pauper Super Qualifier |
| Sunday, January 24, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Vintage Super Qualifier |


*Note: The Pauper and Vintage Qualifiers previously scheduled for that weekend have been replaced with Super Qualifiers in those formats.*


Got the cards already? Regular details of the event apply *(including minimum players and entry options of 40 Event Tickets, 400 Play Points, or 40 Qualifier Points)*, and those can be [found here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2021).


Don't have the cards for your favorite format in your collection or want to try something new? Mythic Event Tokens are available in the MTGO store for $25.00. Once you buy one, you'll be able to enter events and games using just about any deck, even if the cards in it aren't in your collection.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/MTGO-Mythic_Generic.png)


* Purchasing a single Mythic Event Token provides access to almost every card in *Magic Online* *(except* Secret Lair*, promos, sets not released in full on* Magic Online*, and a few others)* and lets you:
* Test out new strategies in Open Play, Solitaire, and Commander
* Try new ideas to win prizes in Leagues and Queues *(normal entry option required)*
* Take on MTGO's best in Format Challenges and Showcase Challenges *(normal entry option required)*
* Enter a Super Qualifier *(normal entry option required)* or purchase a second Mythic Event Token and use both to enter

Please note:


* Spending Mythic Event Tokens doesn't remove All-Access—the access continues to apply to your account until downtime and lets you continue to build decks and enter Leagues, Tournaments, or additional Super Qualifiers with the regular entry options.
* Unused Mythic Event Tokens will be cleared from accounts during the downtime on January 27.

The Mythic Event Token is on sale now for $25.00, and enhanced access lasts until the next scheduled downtime—Wednesday, January 27, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific (17:00 UTC).
