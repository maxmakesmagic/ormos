 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






It's not an exaggeration that Modern is packed with a diversity of archetypes. Small samples from invitation-based events like the Pro Tour help tell the tale but the breakdown of what made Day 2 at Modern Grand Prix, like this weekend in Charlotte, truly put it into perspective.

*(\* denotes a Day 1 undefeated decklist)*



Decks like Grixis Twin, Jund, Naya Burn, Abzan Midrange, and Infect have risen in popularity as new cards from *Khans of Tarkir* Block have entered the format. Splinter Twin and Delver of Secrets decks have also benefited from recent cards and pressure on the format as Amulet Bloom also exploded in popularity.



More specifically, [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) is a new card that continues to cause exploration in Modern. A wide variety of flavors, from supporting the Elves decks to "replacing" [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) in Abzan-flavored creatures to pushing additional aggression and redundancy in Zoo-type builds, mean it isn't clear what the best builds with the card are yet. Every weekend like this one in Charlotte is one step closer to finding the truth.




| Archetype | Count | Percent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Twin (All Varieties) | 56 | 18.0% |
| Jund | 32 | 10.3% |
| Affinity | 30 | 9.6% |
| Burn (All Varieties) | 30 | 9.6% |
| Abzan Midrange | 17 | 5.5% |
| Infect | 17 | 5.5% |
| Red-Green Tron | 16 | 5.2% |
| Company (All Varieties) | 15 | 4.8% |
| Delver (All Varieties) | 14 | 4.5% |
| Merfolk | 10 | 2.6% |
| Amulet Bloom | 8 | 2.6% |
| *All Others* | 66 | 21.2% |
| **TOTAL** | **311** | **100.0%** |

Rolling up the varieties of decks, particularly the diversity of [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), reveals no clear winners beyond Splinter Twin varieties. The long-standing combo deck of Modern is by far the biggest overall contender thanks to the popularity of its Grixis version.


While Splinter Twin was missing among the Day 1 undefeated decklists it'd surprise no one to see it nudge its way into the Top 8. The real question is just "What else is going to find its way their too?"
