 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






Hey, kids, it's that time again! The voting window for the 2015 Class of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame is nearly upon us!


For the next two weeks, the members of the voting committee will be mulling over their ballots, trying to determine which of the 40 names on this year's ballot deserve to be enshrined next to the likes of Jon Finkel, Kai Budde, and three of the most famous letters in *Magic*, LSV. They will be encouraged to write and talk about their selections, to explain to the *Magic* community at large why their chosen player deserves recognition over another. They will argue over the importance of Pro Tour Top 8s, Grand Prix wins, and community contributions. They will call each other names that would make their mothers blush, all in an attempt to justify their choices to their peers. And while this is all going on, you—the community at large—will sit back, hear the arguments, come to your own conclusions, and ultimately have no say in the matter.


Not anymore.


Starting this year, one of the slots on the voting committee goes to the community at large! That's right, alongside all of the Hall of Fame members, *Magic* luminaries, and prolific writers, you members of the community will have your say!


Here's how it works: Below, you'll find the voting form for this year's Pro Tour Hall of Fame! From now until July 20, every member of the *Magic* community can select up to five players that they feel should be members of the 2015 Class of the Hall of Fame. You aren't obliged to select the full five, so only vote for people that you think warrant it, and take your vote seriously! The same way that we encourage the other members of the voting committee to take to social media to discuss their selections, feel free to make your ballot public! Get out there and talk about things before you make your decision! This time of year always fosters some very interesting and involved discussions, and we'd love to make sure that everyone in the community is an active participant rather than a passive observer.


Once the balloting is closed, we will tabulate the votes. The community at large gets one communal vote, and it will be aggregated from all of the received votes. In order for a player to appear on the community ballot, they need to receive votes from at least 40% of the voting public. For the clever and observant ones of you out there (which I assume is all of you . . . good job!), that is the same threshold needed to be actually voted into the Hall of Fame. Once the votes have been added up and the community ballot decided, we will announce your final ballot and add it to the others in this year's voting!

*Editor's Note: A technical issue has required us to restart polling on Wednesday, July 8. If you voted on Tuesday, July 7, please resubmit your votes.*
