The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 8, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by a little bit of weird.

I hear that Seth Manfield guy is pretty good at *Magic: The Gathering*.


Also, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
=====================================


1. [MtA Episode 250: How to Top 8 a Pro Tour](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-250-how-to-top-8-a-pro-tour/) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

This was actually posted yesterday, but went up after I finished the Update. But this one is worth circling back to if you didn't already catch it. Meghan and Maria interview Pro Tour *Ixalan* Top 8 finisher Sam Ihlenfeldt, a friend of the show and, well, basically a friend to anyone. He's just a super friendly guy. He also Top 8ed a Pro Tour on his first try, so he might be good at *Magic* too.


1. [Wizards of the Coast Pro Tour *Ixalan* in Albuquerque, New Mexico](https://www.photobycraig.com/single-post/2017/11/08/Wizards-of-the-Coast-PRO-TOUR-IXALAN-in-Albuquerque-New-Mexico) | Craig Gibson Photography | Craig Gibson

There are two things you should know about Craig Gibson. First, he looks exactly like Sir Davos Seaworth from *Game of Thrones*. Second, he's been the photographer at most Pro Tours for the past 87 years, give or take. Check out this post of a few of his favorite shots from the Pro Tour, but don't hesitate to browse the back catalogue of other events he has on there as well.


1. [Channel LSV – 1v1 Commander: Geist of Saint Traft](https://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-lsv-1v1-commander-geist-of-saint-traft/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

LSV's trips into 1v1 Commander are always a delight, and this one is no different as LSV gets "aggressive" with a commander that isn't strictly mono-blue. It's merely half blue. That's called compromise.


1. [Commander VS: Coliseum of Randomness, Round 2!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36139_Commander-VS-Coliseum-Of-Randomness-Round-2.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

"But, Blake," you say (because we're close like that), "what if I like my Commander less Spikey and with more players?" Well, the internet has everything, so that's available too! The Commander VS crew continues their randomness exercise, so things are sure to get a little weird.


1. [The Worst Color Combos](https://collected.company/2017/11/07/worst-color-combos-151/) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

Jund is a staple. Abzan its successor. Grixis is shining. Temur gets some [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) decks. Jeskai is the preferred control deck of the format. But Sultai, Mardu, and Esper seem to get left out in the cold. Why can no one succeed with these color combinations? Is it a conspiracy? Not trying hard enough? [Queen Marchesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Queen+Marchesa)'s machinations? Kessler and Bateman explore.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Special Preview of Talking Points with Rich Hagon](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/11/special-preview-talking-points-rich-hagon/) | Hipsters of the Coast

Yesterday, Hipsters of the Coast announced a new show with Rich Hagon titled, well, Talking Points with Rich Hagon. But you already knew that from the title. What you might not have known was that this is a show all about professional *Magic* and that it debuts Thursday. As in tomorrow.


Here, Rich can tell you all about it:

What to Watch Tonight

1. Magic Mics | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://go.twitch.tv/magicmics) | 8 p.m. PT/11 p.m. ET/3 a.m. UTC | Evan Erwin, Erin Campbell, and Reuben Bresler

Between *Explorers of Ixalan*, *From the Vault: Transform*, and now the Black Friday Buy-a-Box promo, I *think* they'll have plenty to talk about.

Yesterday we announced [a Black Friday Buy-a-Box promotion](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/black-friday-treasure-chest-promotion-2017-11-07) that's featuring foil double-faced cards from *Ixalan* with alternate art on the back side.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard White-Blue Cycling](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptxln/24-27-point-standard-decklists-2017-11-05)

We've shown off a version of this deck before that went 5-0 in a League, but there's a mile's difference—or more—between a *Magic Online* League and going 8-2 at a Pro Tour, which is exactly what Eliott Boussaud did with a White-Blue [Drake Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven) deck this past weekend.


The deck plays almost exclusively cycling cards, making exceptions only for [Fumigate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate) (because [Fumigate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate)), [Search for Azcanta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta) (because [Search for Azcanta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta)), [Drake Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven) (because cycling), [Farm // Market](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farm+%2F%2F+Market) (because [Drake Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven)), and [Abandoned Sarcophagus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abandoned+Sarcophagus) (because cycling).


Pre-board, the deck's literal only win condition is [Drake Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven), but most decks don't have the ability to deal with [Drake Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven), particularly when cycling means you'll likely see more copies of your threat than their answer. From there, you can pretty much make Drakes every turn, all while getting back access to your cycling cards thanks to [Abandoned Sarcophagus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abandoned+Sarcophagus).


Follow?


Post-board, once your opponent gets rid of all their creature kill, [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) does some work. The sideboard is heavily slanted against Ramunap Red, with only a few ways to interact with opposing control decks. Fortunately for Boussaud, those are few and far between these days.
