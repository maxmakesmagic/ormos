Preparations for the 2011 **Magic Online** Community Cup are in full swing: invitations have gone out, plans have been made, formats have been created, and bold statements have been stated! Join us as the Wizards of the Coast team challenges the Community Team to a series of **Magic Online** events to determine who will victoriously hoist the Erik "Hamtastic" Friborg Memorial Trophy. 

Hosted at our Renton headquarters from June 15 through June 17, the 2011 Community Cup will feature three exciting formats: *Scars of Mirrodin* block draft, Standard and Modern. Both Constructed formats will use "Unified" deck construction rules.

Standard, the most popular Constructed format, includes cards from *Zendikar* block, *Scars of Mirrodin* block, and ***Magic** 2011*. 

The Modern format features sets that were originally printed using the modern card frames. Specifically, the following is permitted in Modern: 

* *Eighth Edition*
* *Ninth Edition*
* *Tenth Edition*
* ***Magic** 2010*
* ***Magic** 2011*
* *Mirrodin* block
* Kamigawa block
* *Ravnica* block
* *Coldsnap*
* *Time Spiral* block (including the "timeshifted" cards)
* *Lorwyn* block
* *Shadowmoor* block
* *Shards of Alara* block
* *Zendikar* block
* *Scars of Mirrodin* block

 In addition, we'll be using the following banned list for the Modern round of the Community Cup: 

* [Ancient Den](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Den)
* [Seat of the Synod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod)
* [Vault of Whispers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers)
* [Great Furnace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace)
* [Tree of Tales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tree+of+Tales)
* [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox)
* [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths)
* [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)
* [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp)
* [Sword of the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek)
* [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte)
* [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll)

Followers of previous Community Cup events should be familiar with the Unified Constructed rules. Under the unified deck construction rules, each team will be responsible for creating eight decks (including sideboards) for the Standard and Modern rounds, however, each team is limited to only four copies of each card legal in that format (except basic lands) for all eight decks. For example, if Team Wizards of the Coast uses two [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull)s in its Caw-Blade deck, it would only have two [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull)s to use in its [Training Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Training+Drone) deck.

Just like they have in years past, all **Magic Online** players will have the opportunity to contribute to the conversation and submit strategy suggestions to the Community Team. Use the following forum threads to discuss each format: 

* [Unified Standard](http://archive.wizards.com/%20http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75846/27652261/2011_Community_Cup_Format_Strategy:_Unified_Standard?sdb=1%20).
* [Unified Modern](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75846/27652265/2011_Community_Cup_Format_Strategy:_Unified_Modern?sdb=1).
* [*Scars of Mirrodin* Block Draft](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75846/27652269/2011_Community_Cup_Format_Strategy:_SOM_Block_Draft?sdb=1).

To let us know what you think about the Modern format in general (not deck strategy, that belongs above), join the conversation [here](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75846/27652321/2011_Community_Cup_Format_Discussion:_Unified_Modern?sdb=1). 

The scoring system used for this year's Community Cup will be similar to last year's system, where each player earns points for his or her team based on the number of match wins each round. Each player's points are added together to determine the team's overall points each round. The team with the most points after the end of the third round wins! 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Matches Won | Points Earned |
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 17 |

  
Of course, there may be opportunities for the Community Team to earn bonus points (Multiball!!!!) but those will be announced closer to the event. And speaking of the Community Team, the players who have been invited will be announced next week (as will the reward they are trying to earn for the community at-large)! Until then, hop on the forums and start discussing deck and format strategies.
