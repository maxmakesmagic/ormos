==============================================



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/styles/auth_small/public/images/person/wizards_authorpic_larger.jpg)

Wizards of the Coast




August 28, 2014
 










Marshall's burning anger (and [Burning Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Anger)) and swarms of Hornets look to take down another draft. But can he emerge from the tank when facing down the [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and a pair of angry, animated scissors? Follow along as Marshall breaks down the draft and analyzes how the cards he passed influence later plays.
