![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPAMS01/864.jpg)**Name:** Brian Davis   
**Age:** 16   
**Location:** Memphis, TN, USA   
**Occupation:** HS Student   
**Played Magic since:** 1997   
**Best accomplishments:**2nd PT Chicago '99, 9th Worlds '00 



**Q: What made you decide to come to Grand Prix Amsterdam?**  

A: To get more PT Points and well, because it's Amsterdam.



**Q: What were your expectations going into this tournament, and why?**  

A: Top 32, I wasn't expecting anything higher because I've never made a PT Point at a GP.



**Q: Briefly describe your tournament play-wise so far, both day one and day two.**  

A: I feel that I have been very focused all weekend.



**Q: What do you think about the format?**  

A: I don't like Invasion Sealed at all, but I really like Invasion Booster and Rochester draft.



**Q: What do you think is the main reason for you making top 8 in this tournament, and why?**  

A: Because I got lucky and got a better than average deck in sealed, and then I drafted very well on the 2nd day.



**Q: What does this top 8 performance mean to you?**  

A: It means solidifying my position on the gravy train and gives me some money which will help me travel to other foreign GP's.



**Q: What are your predictions for the top 8?**  

A: I think that there will be 2 Americans in the finals, hopefully David Price and I.
