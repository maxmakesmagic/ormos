You know, it's always nice to see people you've known for a long time doing well at **Magic**. I have been watching Kid Tidd play **Magic** here in Indiana since he was like twelve (you write the feature match, you get to refer to people by their very old nicknames). That's over a decade. Now I get to see him sitting around the top of the standings at US Nationals, within striking distance of making the team. His opponent, I've known for a considerably lesser time, but has definitely contributed some awesome moments to my **Magic** experience. Luis Scott-Vargas should need no introduction to those of you familiar with tournament **Magic**. For those of you who aren't, let's just say he's good. Really good.


### Game One


LSV started things off with a mulligan, ending on six cards. Tidd's second-turn [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) got to effectively hit LSV for four damage, as it was crushed with a [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) before it even saw an untap step. The [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) he followed with stuck around a bit longer and started to attack in for one. After getting his beat on, Tidd made a second [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), this one managing to stick around.


LSV went to the skies on his turn, using a [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) to fill his hand up with Birds. Tidd once again attacked for one before using his [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and paying some life to make a [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). LSV thought for a minute before accepting. The Pod went straight to work, turning the [Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle) into a [Solemn [autocard]Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+%5Bautocard%5DSimulacrum)[/autocard]. For his part, LSV swung in for one himself before adding an [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel) to his team, leaving a single land available. Not to be outdone, Tidd made a huge flier of his own, taking advantage of his overabundance of mana to kick a [Sphinx of Lost Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths). He also kept heading up the [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) chain, turning his [Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simulacrum) into an [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime), eating LSV's [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade).


LSV settled in, playing another land and passing the turn. When Tidd went for a [Phyrexian Metamorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph) on the ensuing turn, LSV stopped it with a pair of [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s. Tidd simply passed the turn. LSV ate one of Tidd's lands with a [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) before making an [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), adding yet another flier to his team. Tidd used the Pod to turn the Slime into a [Frost Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), which he used to lock down a land, before passing the turn.


It was time for LSV to try to swarm over. He sent all of his creatures but a single Bird at Tidd. The Sphinx took the Angel out, but Tidd took a seven-point blow in the attack. One more of those and he was a goner. At the end of LSV's turn, he flashed in a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), tapping down one of LSV's lands, leaving him on two. After untapping, he dropped a [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin onto it, running the alternate victory path to snatch victory out of defeat.

### Game Two


The first contribution to the board was a [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) that Tidd stuck on the third turn. It met a similar fate to the first one he played in the previous game, going straight to the graveyard thanks to [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember). Just as in last game, Tidd made a [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) to follow his Cobra, and LSV made his first [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). This time, the [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) that his play for Tidd came from his hand instead of a [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), putting him up to six lands in play. LSV swung for one and searched out his last [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) after adding a second to his team.


With his massive land advantage, Tidd tried to cast an [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime), but LSV had a [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) for it. With Tidd tapped out, LSV was able to land and equip a [<&a><a class="nodec" keyname="name" keyvalue="Sword\_of\_Feast\_and\_Famine">Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%3C%2Fa%3E%3Ca+class%3D%22nodec%22+keyname%3D%22name%22+keyvalue%3D%22Sword_of_Feast_and_Famine%22%3ESword+of+Feast+and+Famine), allowing him to untap his lands and cast an [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel) as well. He used the last of his mana to drop Tidd to five lands with a [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge). Stopped on five lands, Tidd had to cast his [Sphinx of Lost Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Lost+Truths) without kicker this game, trying to find a solution to stop the Sword.


LSV activated his [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and sent his entire team. Before blockers were declared, he used his Colonnade to pay for a [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), clearing the Sphinx out of the way. Tidd dropped to two. After untapping and finding nothing to help him, Tidd conceded.

### Game Three


Both players reached for their sideboards to exchange a couple of cards now that the roles had reversed.


"Was [Sunblast Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblast+Angel) your first pick," LSV asked, referring to Tidd's first discard to the [<&a><a class="nodec" keyname="name" keyvalue="Sword\_of\_Feast\_and\_Famine">Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%3C%2Fa%3E%3Ca+class%3D%22nodec%22+keyname%3D%22name%22+keyvalue%3D%22Sword_of_Feast_and_Famine%22%3ESword+of+Feast+and+Famine). When Tidd just looked at him confused, he just laughed and said, "In Draft." Tidd had to laugh.


This time around, LSV had the [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), but Tidd didn't have a [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra). Instead, he resolved a [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) with no creatures in play before resolving a blind [Memoricide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) off of a sneaky Swamp. He named [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and instead saw a hand with Sword of Feast and[Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famine), [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil), [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) and a trio of lands. Though he didn't get the discard, three [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)s made their way out of LSV's deck, and Tidd got a good look at what else LSV had in store for him later in the game.


[Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) made its way onto the table for Tidd, and LSV responded by kicking an [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) at his [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). Metal Jens hit play, pushing Tidd to six lands, but now he couldn't Pod out an [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime). That was good for LSV, since he held a [<&a><a class="nodec" keyname="name" keyvalue="Sword\_of\_Feast\_and\_Famine">Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%3C%2Fa%3E%3Ca+class%3D%22nodec%22+keyname%3D%22name%22+keyvalue%3D%22Sword_of_Feast_and_Famine%22%3ESword+of+Feast+and+Famine), which made its way onto the [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) for a second consecutive game. A second [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) hit play after combat, and LSV passed the turn with mana up for the [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) he was holding. He made sure to immediately use it when Tidd tried to replay the [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) on his turn. With that out of the way, a second Pod came down, immediately turning the [Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simulacrum) into an [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) to kill the Sword.


Fortunately, Tidd had dealt with the Sword. Unfortunately, he was at five life. All LSV had to do was activate his [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and swing for the win.
