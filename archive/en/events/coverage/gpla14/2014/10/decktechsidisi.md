 Eugene Hwang, a 29-year old data analyst from Los Angeles, has been playing *Magic* since he was 10, but as far as really competitive *Magic* goes, he's only been playing since last year. And what a year it was. He decided to fly to Grand Prix Providence on a whim, yet he finished in the Top 16 right away. This fueled his competitive drive. He's gone to 15 Grand Prix tournaments in the last year, and that experience paid off in Orlando two weeks ago with a Grand Prix trophy. Today, the rising talent will do his best to claim another.
