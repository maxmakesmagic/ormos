The creative minds of the **Magic: The Gathering** developers have teamed up with some of the world's finest fantasy illustrators to present to you these lavish, high-quality collector's series art prints and canvases. Featuring the brilliance of Greg Staples, Scott Fisher and Donato Giancola, this first set of five pieces features 5 icon Magic creatures.



These pieces are available two ways:


**18"x24" prints with mattes, and a Certificate of Authenticity, for $49 each**


*and*


**18"x24" canvases with black wood frames, and a certificate of Authenticity, for $299 each.**


Choose from the following classics. Or avoid such a tough decision and purchase all five. *(click on print or canvas to get a closer look at what they will look like)*

Make sure that you act fast. There are only 1,000 limited edition prints and 250 limited edition canvasses. The prints are sequentially numbered and signed by the artists; the canvasses are hand-signed and also hand-numbered.
