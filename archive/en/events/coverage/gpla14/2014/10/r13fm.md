Austrian Valentin Mackl has had to share the top tables all weekend with brother-in-arms, Brad Nelson. Both are playing the Mardu Midrange deck that has really made waves this weekend. In fact, they are sitting beside each other in the feature-match area right now.


Mackl's up against No. 11â€“ranked Eric Froehlich, playing the burn-ish, tempo-ish, aggro-ish Jeskai deck. Mackl's deck is tuned to beat up on this kind of deck, but it's still a hard match, for sure. One of the reason Froehlich is on the deck is because of it's positive games against just about everything. But this Mardu deck seems like something else entirely.



 Froehlich pointed to the tokens lining the side of the match area. "Do they have these lined up and ready for you?" Mackl played coy, and Froehlich continued, "I hope you don't play anything that makes tokens. That's bad for me." Mackl made sure not to flash the [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) and [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) in his 75.




**The Games**




 Mackl's first [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) hit the tech-y [Nullify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullify) from Froehlich, who then tried to stick his own red 2/2. But that was hit by a burn spell from Mackl. This game was all about removing all the threats the opponent could muster. Whoever could outlast the flurry of spells would be the victory.




 And the great black-red-white hope for Mackl's deck is the [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), which can trump that usual back and forth. This game, it was two copies of the 5/4 flyer. Froehlich dug for answers with a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), but each answer would eat up most of the American's turn. This is exactly where Mackl wanted to be.
