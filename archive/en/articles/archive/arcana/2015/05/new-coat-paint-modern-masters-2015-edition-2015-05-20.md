A New Coat of Paint for Modern Masters 2015 Edition

 Yichao is a writer of words for plays, television, theme parks, and—most recently—Magic: The Gathering. He loves Cube Draft and corgis. 






In *Modern Masters*, all of the cards are reprints, meaning you've probably seen many of these cards before—but I know you haven't seen *all* of these cards exactly as they are in this set! *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* features several pieces of brand new art, giving some old favorites exciting new face lifts.



1. [Daybreak Coronet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Coronet)

[Daybreak Coronet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Coronet) | Art by [Johannes Voss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Johannes%20Voss%22%5d)



This is [Daybreak Coronet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Coronet)'s first printing outside of the *Future Sight* frame. Since *Future Sight*, it has also found itself a new home: the enchantment-heavy plane of Theros, complete with a tasty piece of flavor text from Brimaz. I'm pretty sure the actual Coronet is the magical glowing energy in the picture, but I like to think it's that stylin' scarf the leonin is sporting. You do you, Mr. Leonin.

[Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) | Art by [Willian Murai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Willian%20Murai%22%5d)



A little piece of trivia: This is actually the third piece of artwork associated with [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). In 2011, [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) received alternate art when it was printed as a Judge Foil. The mischievous trio is back again, brightly colored and ready to rain on your opponents' parades.

This was the card created by pro player and *Magic* Hall of Fame member Jon Finkel as his card for winning the 2000 *Magic* Invitational. As with all Invitational cards, the previous art [Shadowmage Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=33604) featured the likeness of the player who designed it.

[Pillory of the Sleepless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillory+of+the+Sleepless) | Art by [Marc Simonetti](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Marc%20Simonetti%22%5d)



Nothing clever to say here. This art is just fantastic. It's always fun to see a new piece of art for a card that still harkens back to the original, but with strong changes that make it uniquely its own. The shift in camera angle from head-on to a more dynamic pose, the evolution to a shadowy haze holding the figure under lock and key…it's all pretty sweet.
