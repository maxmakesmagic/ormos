Alex Kudlick vs. Benjamin Lundquist
-----------------------------------


Ben Lundquist, described by Antonino De Rosa as the "future of American Magic," faced Alex Kudlick in the quarterfinals. Kudlick was armed with Ghost Husk, a deck designed to deploy black and white monsters, fill up with Bob, and explode with a gigantic [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) courtesy of [Promise of Bunrei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Bunrei) tokens. Lundquist wielded blue-red Tron, a blue-red control deck willing to blow up the world with [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) thanks to its high-powered Urza land and signet mana base, then clean up with [Keiga, the Tide Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star) and, if necessary, [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire).

### Game 1


Both players kept their initial seven. Kudlick opened with a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) while Lundquist deployed Urza pieces and a pair of [Izzet Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet)s. Kudlick tried [Promise of Bunrei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Bunrei) to speed up his [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk)-based clock, but it met [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). Lundquist showed him what speed could be with a turn 4 [Keiga, the Tide Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star).


Kudlick, already on the back foot, had to get things moving. He dropped Promise again, which resolved, but Lundquist swung in with Keiga and cast [Tidings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings) to restock. Kudlick's Bob revealed another Bob, and swung in. A resolved [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) was good news, and a resolved [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate) even better.


Lundquist revealed two [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire), two signets, and another copy of Keiga. Kudlick took the [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire), but still had to deal with a 5/5 dragon.


Lundquist had a power turn. He fueled up yet again with [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), discarding [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), then dropped a third Urza piece, completing his Tron. Two signets later he Researched again, discarding an Urza piece.


Bob revealed [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate), which Kudlick cast immediately. It showed two [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and a [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) as the new information. Kudlick had maintained good intel on Lundquist's hand, but had an uphill climb to turn that knowledge into a win. He took the second copy of Keiga and made a second [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), to which Lundquist said, "Sure."


The blue dragon hit the Red Zone again. Kudlick dropped to 6 with two Bobs in play. Lundquist dropped Minamo, and had one particular legend in mind to untap with it.


Bobs revealedâ€¦ land, land, and Kudlick swung in with both Confidants and a Husk. Keiga duly untapped and, after a brief firefight over a [Mortify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify), blocked the Husk. Kudlick put damage on the stack and tossed both Confidants into the Husk, saving it and generating four spirit tokens from the Promise. Lundquist took 4, going to 11 and looking unconcerned.


Lundquist played for tempo by [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal)ing Husk, which committed suicide. Keiga bashed again, and despite another resolved Husk and a Jitte, Kudlick couldn't muster enough life or damage to survive the dragon's final hit.


Kudlick 0 - Lundquist 1


### Game 2


Kudlick chose to play, and turned that advantage into a turn-two [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate), revealing [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire), three signets, [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and land. He took the counterspell. Lundquist deployed signet after signet, and cast a drawn [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) to bounce Kudlick's fresh [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). Kudlick replayed Bob but had no fourth land drop.


Lundquist, way ahead on mana, calmly [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire)d the board.


Kudlick was in dire straits with only [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) for seven turns, eventually discarding Pontiff, Husk times two, Bob, and [Eight-and-a-Half-Tails](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eight-and-a-Half-Tails) before finally finding a bounceland. Meanwhile Lundquist was content to rebuild his mana and hand and wait for action to counter.

Kudlick tried Bob: [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). He tried Bob and Isamaru: [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Lundquist refueled with [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), discarding [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) and [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare), yet still had [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) for Kudlick's [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate). His mana recovered, Kudlick tried to fight the card advantage war with a resolved [Okiba-Gang Shinobi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okiba-Gang+Shinobi), but Lundquist had [Volcanic Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for the [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) meant to protect it. A second Shinobi met a second Hammer, and then Lundquist launched a [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire) for 13, and followed up with a second one the next turn for the rest.


Kudlick 0 - Lundquist 2


### Game 3


Kudlick mulliganed to six, but opened with Isamaru and a [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate). Shown an interesting hand of [Simic Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Signet), [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire), two [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) and a [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), Kudlick took the signet, trying to stall Lundquist's mana engine and put the hurt on. Lundquist took the opportunity to set a [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) each on [Okiba-Gang Shinobi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okiba-Gang+Shinobi) and Jitte.


Kudlick put the pedal down with [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and [Promise of Bunrei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Bunrei). Lundquist cast [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), discarding Minamo, and then completed the Urzatron the next turn and dropped a Hammer on Bob's head. The enchantment made good its Promise of four spirits.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat06/QF_Kudlick_Lundquist.jpg)*Kudlick's team faces off against an army of one.*
Isamaru and spirits crashed in for 6, bringing Lundquist to 6, and Husk joined them. But Lundquist had [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), his crucial second red mana, and [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire)d. Only Husk survived on Kudlick's board.


Husk swung in and hit Lundquist down to 4, but Lundquist, flush with answers, produced the [Volcanic Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) for the unprotected Husk.


Both players entered draw-go mode, replenishing their land base. Kudlick had the first move, trying 8.5 Tails, but it met a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), then the next turn, a [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare). Lundquist had taken pain and mana burn from his awkward mana, however, and was down to 2 now. He [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed Husk and got down to business with Meloku.


Kudlick had [Okiba-Gang Shinobi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okiba-Gang+Shinobi) and a plan to stave off the sweep. He held [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) and looked to point Meloku's power of 2 into the face of its master. Lundquist made two more illusions and swung over for 5, but Kudlick was tapped out from the Shinobi and had no white card to pitch, so he took the damage, down to 10.


An illusion token chump-blocked the Shinobi. When Meloku and friends attacked back for 5, Kudlick tried a Shoal for 2, with enough mana open to do it again. Lundquist [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed the first Shoal, then [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed the second, with one untapped mana free to make an illusion token for the final crucial chump-block on the ninja.


Kudlick, out of gas and facing a lethal Meloku squad, extended the hand.


Kudlick 0 - Lundquist 3
