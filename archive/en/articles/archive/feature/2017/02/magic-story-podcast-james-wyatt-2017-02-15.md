Guess what tomorrow is, kids?


It's *Plane Shift: Kaladesh* Day! Yaaaaaaaayyy!


Child-like enthusiasm aside, the *Plane Shift* series created by James Wyatt is pretty much one of the coolest things we do on this website. If you aren't familiar, it's a supplement to *Dungeons & Dragons* that uses the *Magic* art books as a source for creating D&D campaigns in a *Magic* setting. So you can investigate Innistrad or zip through Zendikar or, now, kibosh in Kaladesh. Hey, there are only so many "k" words.


The *Magic* Story Podcast, meanwhile, goes behind the scenes with the people who make the worlds; create the characters; and, this week, create the books and supplements that enhance the world. Ladies and gentlemen, James Wyatt.
