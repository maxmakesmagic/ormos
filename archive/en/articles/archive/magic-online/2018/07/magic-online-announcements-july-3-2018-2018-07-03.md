M19 Prerelease This Weekend
---------------------------


Core sets are back! *Core Set 2019* Sealed Leagues kick off on *Magic Online* this Friday, July 6—so you can get some early practice before your paper Prerelease July 7 and 8. Seize your first chance to play *Magic* in its purest form (complete with badass new incarnations of the original Elder Dragons).


M19 Draft Leagues begin Monday, July 9. For more info about M19 on MTGO, including event details, check out Alli Medwin's article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/core-set-2019-comes-magic-online-july-6-2018-06-28).

Updates to MTGO Customer Support
--------------------------------


As of this Thursday, July 5, customer support for *Magic Online* is moving to [mtgo-support.wizards.com](https://mtgo-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us). Use that site for reporting bugs, requesting reimbursement, sending feedback, getting help with account problems, or anything else for which you need customer service. Going forward, for *Magic Online* issues, you will not need to sign in to the site to submit tickets—just click the Submit a Request link in the upper right corner, select a request type, and enter your email address on the ticket form.

Team Standard Super League Tonight
----------------------------------


The latest offering in our roster of Team Super League shenanigans is Team Standard Super League. The format is a bit different from the "Conqueror" rules used for TMSL and TVSL, but the basics are the same: team-wide deck-building restrictions, rotating players, and weekly elimination tournaments. See what kinds of crazy brews these teams bring to the table in the world of *Dominaria* Standard!


TSSL will air each Tuesday at 5 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).




---

Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!


TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).
