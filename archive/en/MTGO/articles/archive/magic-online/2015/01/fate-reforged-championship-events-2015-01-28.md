*Fate Reforged* is a set about taking matters into your own hands and making things diferent than they were before—better than they were before. Did Sarkhan have naysayers who thought it was, perhaps, unwise to invest so much time and energy into resurrecting Dragons, one of humanity's few natural predators? Sure, but he kept his chin up and stuck it out. Sarkhan spread his wings—actual, literal [dragon wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=178016)—and soared back in time to change history. You go, Sarkhan! Seize that day!


Now, it's your turn to do the same. Not the deal with the fate of all Dragons, or the thing with the wings—Sarkhan already has that covered. Your focus is needed elsewhere, if you have big dreams of becoming a champion, that is. The *Fate Reforged* Championships are coming soon!


Players won't be able to turn back time, mystically re-wrapping boosters to change their Sealed pools but, with excellent strategy, skill, and some study of Limited play, they just may succeed in their quest of advancing to the Finals. [*Fate Reforged* Limited Championship Qualifiers](#ltdqualifier) begin on Wednesday, February 25, 12:30 p.m. Pacific (UTC-8), and run through Tuesday, March 3, at 9:30 p.m. Pacific. If your destiny is a Standard Championship, however, your path lies elsewhere.


"Curses! If only I had found a way to jam a few more Dragons into my deck." This is a common lament one might hear around the water-cooler lately. Not you, though. Nope, you followed Sarkhan's wise example and have been backing your fire-breathing brethren since day one. You play nothing but Five-Color Dragons, and good on you too. You'll have no regrets when the [*Fate Reforged* Standard Qualifiers](#strdqualifier) start up on Wednesday, March 4, 12:30 p.m. Pacific. Standard Qualifiers run every three hours, on the half hour, through Tuesday, March 10, 9:30 p.m. Pacific. Even if an invitation eludes you the first time, just take out a few of those silly spells, add a few more Dragons, and jump back into the fray. After all, participation in any Qualifier will win players a nonfoil, full art, [Mardu Shadowspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Shadowspear) for their trouble. Four or five match wins in any Qualifier earns you an invitation, allowing you to ascend to the next level of *Fate Reforged* play, the Championship Finals.


You studied, you planned ahead, and you followed your dream doggedly until an invitation was finally yours. You've proven once and for all that, while not as cool as time-travel (not even close to as cool), foresight and stick-to-it-ness can be just as effective. All that's left are the Championship Finals themselves. [*Fate Reforged* Limited Championship Finals](#ltdfinals) are up first on Saturday, March 7, 8:00 a.m. Pacific. The [*Fate Reforged* Standard Championship Finals](#strdfinals) follow closely behind on Sunday, March 15, 8:00 a.m. Pacific. Whatever leads you down your path to the Championships, good luck!
