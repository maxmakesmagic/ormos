He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






On Friday night, the players will be seated to take a “Magic IQ test”. This test will quiz the players on a variety of magic subjects and test much of their magic skills and knowledge. There will be sections on logic, probability, memory, rules and so on. will consist of 24 separate sections. will have a 50 minute time limit. Some of the sections of will quiz the player on basic skills others will be set up to benefit a player who has “prepared” for . (Some recommended areas of study will be posted on the forums)

On Saturday players will be seated in 8-man pods. s from the previous day will have been graded. Each section (24) of will represent 1 booster pack during the draft. The draft will be similar to a Rochester draft, in that 1 pack will be drafted at a time, and the entire pack will be opened face-up before drafting. The pick order for each pack will be based on score for that section of . The player with the highest score on a particular section will get first pick in that pack, the second highest score will get 2nd pick (and 15th). The player with the lowest test score will have to hear the insults from the rest of the table and he will get the wheel (8th and 9th pick). Seating during the draft is of no importance because the pick order changes from pack to pack. Before each pack the table judge will pass out a card (placed face-up) with the players draft order for that round. The exact pack composition has not been decided but will be notated within following the heading for each section. It will be made up from the last 5 expert level sets (Odyssey forward) and 7th edition (In other words all the packs legal for standard constructed play).

Players will be seated in pods of 8. The 3 matches in the format will be only against players from this pod. Matches will be 2 out of 3 games. Unlimited basic lands can be added to each deck, there is a 40-card deck minimum size. The cards picked during the draft that are not in your main-deck make up your sideboard.
