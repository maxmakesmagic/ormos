### *What is the most underrated card in Scars of Mirrodin Block Constructed? What is the most overrated?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqWa.jpg)**Yuuya Watanabe:** Underrated? Hmm... [Entomber Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomber+Exarch). Overrated is [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqDu.jpg)**Reid Duke:** I think the most overrated card in Block is [Elspeth Tirel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth+Tirel). A five-drop in the control decks just needs to turn the game right there, and she doesn't quite do it. The most underrated card is [Darkslick Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Drake) for the same reason why Elspeth is bad. It fits exactly what the control decks want to do at its slot.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqWe.jpg)**Alex West:** Underrated is [Thrun, the Last Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) and overrated is... [Puresteel Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqBl.jpg)**Sam Black:** For underrated, I should definitely say [Piston Sledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piston+Sledge), but for general application, I'll say [Into the Core](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Core). I think the most overrated is probably [Stoic Rebuttal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Rebuttal).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqGo.jpg)**Simon GÃ¶rtzen:** The most overrated is definitely [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx). I think the most underrated is probably [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). People think he's good, but he's even better than that.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqOc.jpg)**David Ochoa:** Heh, for overrated I would say [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Underrated though? Hmm... yeah, I think I'm going to say [Pristine Talisman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Talisman).


### *What's the Best Piece of Equipment in Scars of Mirrodin Block Constructed?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqNe.jpg)**Brad Nelson:** [Lashwrithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqVi.jpg)**Gaudenis Vidugiris:** My deck wouldn't work without [Piston Sledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piston+Sledge), but I'm still going to have to go with [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqUt.jpg)**Josh Utter-Leyton:**
[Lashwrithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqDo.jpg)**Rob Dougherty:**
[Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), but it's not in my deck! [Mortarpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) is probably the best piece of Equipment that I'm playing.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqMi.jpg)**Kazuya Mitamura:** None of them! Or maybe [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqCa.jpg)**Gabe Carleton-Barnes:**
[Mortarpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod).


### *What's the best planeswalker in Scars of Mirrodin Block Constructed?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqVi.jpg)**Gaudenis Vidugiris:**
[Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqWe.jpg)**Alex West:**
[Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated); he's the end boss in control mirrors.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqUt.jpg)**Josh Utter-Leyton:**
[Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqDu.jpg)**Reid Duke:** Koth. [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) and [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer) are the only planeswalkers that come down fast enough to impact the game, but Tezzeret forces you to play with too many artifacts for your deck to stay competitive against [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqKo.jpg)**Conrad Kolos:**
[Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). The planeswalkers in this block are generally aggressive rather than defensive, so you can't really protect Koth.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqWo.jpg)**Conley Woods:**
[Elspeth Tirel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth+Tirel). Koth puts too much of a constraint on how you build your deck. You can build a two-color Elspeth deck, but you can't build a two-color Koth deck.
