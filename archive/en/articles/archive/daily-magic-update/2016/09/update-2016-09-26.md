The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 23, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Sol Ring into Chandra, Torch of Defiance. In Limited](#8). Because that's a thing you can do.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [20 Standard Brews with Kaladesh: #11–20](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/20-standard-brews-with-kaladesh-11-20/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Infinite Thopters, [Lupine Prototype](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lupine+Prototype)s, Temur Saheeli, and plenty more decklists from Karsten in the second part of his 20-deck opus.


1. [Ally Encampment – 4 – Dispelling Myths and Creating Players](http://www.cardconfidants.com/podcast/ally-encampment-4-dispelling-myths-and-creating-players/) | Planeswalkers 4 Diversity | Emily Jarrett, Ben Wheeler, and Trevor Murdock

Melissa DeTora joins the fourth episode of Ally Encampment as the Planeswalkers 4 Diversity group talks about PAX, diversity with data, and teaching new players to play *Magic*.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Vorthos Banned and Restricted Announcement](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/carythomasbarkett-09262016-vorthos-banned-and-restricted-announcement/) | Gathering Magic | Cary Thomas Barkett

This is a really cool way to tackle this subject. Barkett discusses some older *Magic* novels and how they might clash a bit with the new line of [*Magic* Story](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/magic-story-archive)—and restricts one in *Magic* cannon while banning another entirely.


1. [Ars Arcanum: *Kaladesh* Spoiler Analysis](http://puremtgo.com/articles/ars-arcanum-kaladesh-spoiler-analysis) | PureMTGO | Matthew Watkins

When this says "analysis," you better believe that is precisely what it means. Watkins goes deep—statistically deep—to analyze the *Kaladesh* Limited format by breaking down the numbers that paint a picture of the set. Trend line for converted mana cost? He's got that. Power and toughness versus converted mana cost? Also has that. And for all you stats lovers out there, Watkins even has a scatterplot of sets mapping efficiency versus size.


Yeah, those are words I just wrote about a *Magic* article.


1. [*Kaladesh* Set Review: Rare and Mythic Rare](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-356-kaladesh-set-review-rare-and-mythic-rare/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Marshall [took this one seriously](https://twitter.com/lsv/status/780068422834978819). And at a scant 2.5 hours, they even went relatively quickly. 5/7, would listen again.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> I look forward to an explanation of why Peregrine Drake wasn't banned in [#MTGPauper](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGPauper?src=hash). I'm not excited about playing in the next 4 months.

[No changes were made to the Banned and Restricted](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/september-26-2016-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2016-09-26) list. For the most part, [it's what people expected](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/54kuw0/september_26_banned_restricted_announcement_no/d82nv04), except in one format—[Pauper](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/54kuw0/september_26_banned_restricted_announcement_no/d82nw6b). Many people [expected Peregrine Drake](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/54kuw0/september_26_banned_restricted_announcement_no/d82nvyl) to get the axe ([many people](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/54kuw0/september_26_banned_restricted_announcement_no/d82nw3c)), but that didn't happen. Head over to [this thread on Reddit's Pauper forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pauper/comments/54kvfo/september_26_banned_restricted_announcement_no/) to see what that part of the community thinks of the decision.


Also note that [Commander did not ban any cards either](http://www.mtgcommander.net/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=18371). Basically, if you had a deck in any format yesterday, you can play it tomorrow.

And that's the highest I heard of anyone getting on the energy scale. A few others said they spent more energy than this over a few turns, but we're talking peak energy here, and it looks like 39 wins the weekend.

There were a lot of great pulls people shared this weekend, but this is certainly among the best possible. You can see a [few more on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/543gro/prerelease_discussion_megathread_for_kaladesh/), and experience the envy.

This is what we love about Prereleases.


Decks of the Day
================


1. [Brewing Kaladesh II: Madcap Reservoir, Car Zoo, and Budget Options for Week One](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/brewing-kaladesh-ii-madcap-reservoir-car-zoo-and-budget-options-for-week-one) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

There are a number of fun deck ideas in this one. There's a [Madcap Experiment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Madcap+Experiment) deck for Modern that finishes with [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir). True story. There's also a Standard [Wispweaver Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wispweaver+Angel) deck that goes infinite in Standard, plus something called Red-White Car Zoo.


SaffronOlive is always good for a brew or two, but with the format still unexplored, this is the best time to pay attention to our community's most creative deck builders.
