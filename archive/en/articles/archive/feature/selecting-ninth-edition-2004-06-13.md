Welcome to [Selecting *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/columnarchive&column=SelectingNinthEdition), where you get to play the role of R&D developer, art director, and flavor text writer for **Magic**'s next Core Set! You can return to this page each Monday to see what new decisions you get to make, and to check the ongoing results throughout the summer.


![Selecting Ninth Edition](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/mtgcom_daily_af18_picMain_en.jpg)**Be the R&D developer.** Each week between June 14th and September 6th, you'll vote on a showdown between two (and sometimes more than two) cards. You get to decide which ends up in *Ninth Edition* and which gets kicked to the curb.


**Be the art director.** Starting in July, you'll see two sketches for the art of *Ninth Edition* cards, and you'll get to decide which piece -- and which artist -- gets the thumbs up. The sketch will then be turned into a completed painting and put onto a *Ninth Edition* card.


**Be the flavor text writer.** Starting in August, you'll get to submit original flavor text for several *Ninth Edition* cards and vote on your favorite piece. The winning submissions will show up right there in italics at the bottom of the text box when *Ninth Edition* releases.
