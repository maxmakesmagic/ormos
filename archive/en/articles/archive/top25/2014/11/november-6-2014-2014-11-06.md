 Welcome to our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. There were two Grand Prix last weekend. In South America, the capital city of [Santiago, Chile](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsan14), took center stage, where former Top 25 player Willy Edel of Brazil did his points total no harm when reaching the Top 8, before twice mulliganing to three cards to end his run.




 However, the majority of the action was in [Nashville, Tennessee](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnas14), where *Khans of Tarkir* Team Limited was the format. Always a recipe for the cream rising to the top, Team Sealed delivered again in Nashville, with a slew of top pros meeting success. There were four major movers up the chart, and three of those came via Top 4 team finishes. The biggest winner was *the* winner, Jacob Wilson, alongside teammates Matt Nass and Jesse Hampton. Wilson leaps six spots, up to No. 13 this week. Their final triumph was over a monster lineup of World Champion Shahar Shenhar (unchanged at No. 16), Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, and [Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/welcome) Champion Tom Martell, who moves up five to No. 15.



Also making the Top 4 in Nashville was Sam Black, alongside Matt Severa and longtime travelling companion Gaudenis Vidugiris. Their 4th place takes Sam up five spots to No. 17. Then there's Eric Froehlich. Although his stellar team, featuring Luis Scott-Vargas and Paul Cheon, couldn't replicate their Top 4 finish from the last Team GP, their 9th-place was still good for 3 Pro Points, and for Froehlich to move up three, into the Top 10 at No. 8.


As for the rest of the list, Ari Lax nudged up one to No. 6, a bunch at the bottom lost ground, and Andrew Cuneo joined the rankings at No. 25. Can he stay there? Join us next week, as we'll have all the news from the Top 25 ahead of a massive double-header in Madrid and New Jersey. See you then!
