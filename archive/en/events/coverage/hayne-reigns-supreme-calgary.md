Grand Prix Calgary 2013
-----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcal13/trophy.jpg)Tomorrow might be Alexander Hayne's birthday, but today he's going to celebrate his first Grand Prix victory.


With a Pro Tour victory already under his belt and a runner up finish at Grand Prix Montreal in 2011, Hayne has piled up an impressive resume just short of his nearly-here 25th birthday. Hayne may not be representing Team Canada at this year's World **Magic** Cup, but he's quickly becoming Canada's great Stetson-wearing hope.


Surrounded by a field of Jund Midrange, Gruul Aggro, and Bant Hexproof, Hayne and and his UWR Flash deck—not to mention that Calgary-approved hat—proved to be more than up to the challenge of countering his way through the largely Canadian field. After narrowly dispatching Jacob Wilson—who has three Grand Prix Top 8s himself—in the quarterfinals, Hayne soundly defeated two Jund deck on his way to the trophy. After splitting the first two games, Hayne managed to silence Stephane Gerard with a complete victory punctuated by [Thundermaw Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundermaw+Hellkite) and a bevy of [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s.


And while Jund paced the field, the Top 8 showed us just how many things were possible. Gerard rode [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) all the way to the finals—in his first Grand Prix no less—while Adam Lafrost (Mono Red [Burning Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Earth)) and Trent Douglas (Nearly Mono Black Control) put entirely new archetypes on the map.


But the trophy, the white hat, and Canada's love belong to Alexander Hayne, Champion of Grand Prix Calgary and newly-minted 25-year-old. A very Happy Birthday, Alex!
