![Repay in Kind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Repay+in+Kind)**[Repay in Kind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repay+in+Kind)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* rare. From the [*Rise of the Eldrazi* FAQ](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/roe_faq_20100407_en.rtf): For a player's life total to become a certain number that's lower than his or her current life total, what actually happens is that the player loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if the lowest life total in the game is 5 and another player has 12 life, [Repay in Kind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repay+in+Kind) will cause that player to lose 7 life. Abilities that interact with life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
 ![Lighthouse Chronologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lighthouse+Chronologist)**[Lighthouse Chronologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* mythic rare. From the [*Rise of the Eldrazi* FAQ](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/roe_faq_20100407_en.rtf): In a two-player game, if you have a level 7 Lighthouse Chronologist and there are no other extra-turn effects, the game will proceed like this (with extra turns in brackets): your turn, your opponent's turn, [your turn], your turn, your opponent's turn, [your turn], your turn, your opponent's turn, and so on.
 ![Forked Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forked+Bolt)**[Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* uncommon. From the [*Rise of the Eldrazi* FAQ](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/roe_faq_20100407_en.rtf): You divide the damage as you cast Forked Bolt, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. (In other words, as you cast Forked Bolt, you choose whether to have it deal 2 damage to a single target, or deal 1 damage to each of two targets.)
 ![Hellcarver Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hellcarver+Demon)**[Hellcarver Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellcarver+Demon)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* mythic rare. From the [*Rise of the Eldrazi* FAQ](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/roe_faq_20100407_en.rtf): You cast nonland cards from exile as part of the resolution of Hellcarver Demon's ability. You may cast those cards in any order. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions are not (such as "Cast [this card] only before the combat damage step"). You cast all of the cards you like, putting them onto the stack, then Hellcarver Demon's ability finishes resolving.
 ![Angelheart Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angelheart+Vial)**[Angelheart Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelheart+Vial)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* rare. From the [*Rise of the Eldrazi* FAQ](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/roe_faq_20100407_en.rtf): If you're dealt enough damage to reduce your life total to 0 or less, you'll lose the game before you can put charge counters on Angelheart Vial.
 ![Escaped Null](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Escaped+Null)**[Escaped Null](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Escaped+Null)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* uncommon. A null is what happens when a regular Zendikar vampire drains enough blood from a sentient creature. To get a vampire instead of a null, the blood has to be drained by a Bloodchief.
 ![Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle)**[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle)** – *Zendikar* rare. [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) is the tallest and most active peak of the "Crown of Talib" mountain range in Ondu. Talib, the Kor god of the earth, turns out to be a dimly remembered version of [Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+Butcher+of+Truth), who has now been released from his prison.
 ![Cosi's Trickster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cosi%27s+Trickster)**[Cosi's Trickster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cosi%27s+Trickster)** – *Zendikar* rare. [Cosi's Trickster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cosi%27s+Trickster) and [Psychogenic Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychogenic+Probe) both care about opponents shuffling. This means that they'd be ideal in a deck featuring the forgotten *Alliances* card [Soldier of Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+Fortune), which has been waiting for years to finally do something useful.
 ![Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kozilek%27s+Predator)**[Kozilek's Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* common. The three "big" Eldrazi each have common creatures associated with them in three different colors. [Kozilek's Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator) is green, [Emrakul's Hatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%27s+Hatcher) is red, and [Pawn of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog) is black. Then there's also the black sorcery [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), but that doesn't apply to this pseudocycle.
 ![Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kozilek%2C+Butcher+of+Truth)**[Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+Butcher+of+Truth)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* mythic rare. Truth is a popular element of **Magic** creatures. In addition to the [Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kozilek%252C%2BButcher%2Bof%2BTruth), the [Sphere of Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sphere%2Bof%2BTruth), and the [Voice of Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Voice%2Bof%2BTruth), there's also [Seizan, Perverter of Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seizan%2C+Perverter+of+Truth). Truth can get butchered *and* perverted!
 ![Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ulamog%2C+the+Infinite+Gyre)**[Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Infinite+Gyre)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* mythic rare. Ulamog, the monstrosity whose half-forgotten name came to be known as the merfolk sea god Ula, is emblematic of plague, the blind bonds between parasite and host, and overabundance. Ulamog is creation and destruction wrapped together in unholy harmony.
 ![Mox Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mox+Lotus)**[Mox Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Lotus)** – *Unhinged* rare. Un-cards don’t have Oracle wordings, so [Mox Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Lotus) is left with a line of text that is now just a game rule, like "Each creature assigns combat damage equal to its power." This also happens on [Nirkana Revenant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nirkana+Revenant), although there the card's text actually does something.
 ![Bottomless Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bottomless+Pit)**[Bottomless Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottomless+Pit)** – *Stronghold* uncommon. [Bottomless Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottomless+Pit) appeared in the "Migraine" preconstructed deck for *Stronghold*. The official description of that deck claimed it had a "subtle design", although the [Mindwarper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindwarper), [Coercion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coercion)s, and [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim)s kind of give it away.
 ![Endless Cockroaches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Endless+Cockroaches)**[Endless Cockroaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Cockroaches)** – *Portal* rare. *Portal* used different terminology from regular **Magic**, including calling the graveyard the "discard pile". Between that and the changes in regular **Magic** lingo, this relatively straightforward card has only seven words (not counting "[Endless Cockroaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Cockroaches)" in common between its printed and Oracle text.
 ![Infinite Authority](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infinite+Authority)**[Infinite Authority](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Authority)** – *Legends* rare. We're going to be honest with you. We tried pretty hard to come up with something to say about [Infinite Authority](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Authority), but all we can come up with is "Wow. *Legends*, huh?"
 ![Frankenstein's Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster)**[Frankenstein's Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster)** – *The Dark* rare. In the early days of **Magic** (which you could describe as *The Dark* days if you wanted to), cards took inspiration from all over. Sometimes, as in the case [Frankenstein's Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster), the inspiration was kind of obvious.
 ![Bosh, Iron Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bosh%2C+Iron+Golem)**[Bosh, Iron Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh%2C+Iron+Golem)** – *Mirrodin* rare. Here at Card of the Day, we like it when flavor text explains the action on the card: *As Glissa searches for the truth about Memnarch, Bosh searches to unearth the secrets of his past.*
![Uktabi Kong](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Uktabi+Kong)**[Uktabi Kong](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Kong)** – *Unhinged* rare. As a larger version of [Uktabi Orangutan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan), [Uktabi Kong](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Kong) destroys all artifacts, instead of just one. But it's not just the simians of Uktabi; [Uktabi Faerie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Faerie) also seems to hate artifacts.
 ![Wall of Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wall+of+Earth)**[Wall of Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Earth)** – *Legends* common. [Wall of Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Earth) is nice and straightforward: a large wall for a low price. It seems like the sort of card you'd expect to see from the days of *Legends*. Strangely, though, there was already an [Wall of Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wall%2Bof%2BStone) in the same color in every core set from *Alpha* through *Fifth Edition*, so [Wall of Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Earth) probably wasn't strictly necessary.
 ![Serenity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Serenity)**[Serenity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Serenity)** – *Weatherlight* rare. On the [Discussion tab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Discussion.aspx?multiverseid=4586) for [Serenity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Serenity), **mrredhatter** suggests trying it with [Soul Scuptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Scuptor). Not bad!
 ![Razia, Boros Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Razia%2C+Boros+Archangel)**[Razia, Boros Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razia%2C+Boros+Archangel)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* rare. To quote [Matt Cavotta](/en/articles/archive/holy-war-boros-legion-2005-12-07), "Razia has been the heart and soul of the Boros guild since the signing of the guildpact. She is more like a demi-god to the army than a military leader, inspiring greatness and giving hope, meaning, and destiny to her Boros devout. Just to keep the black-hearted honest, she does, on occasion, rip the battlefield with holy fire." 
 ![Elder Land Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elder+Land+Wurm)**[Elder Land Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Land+Wurm)** – *Masters Edition* uncommon. The *Future Sight* card [Frozen Æther](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frozen+%C3%86ther) refers to two *Legends* cards in its flavor text: [Elder Land Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Land+Wurm) and [Hunding Gjornersen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunding+Gjornersen). That's in addition to its ability being a reference to [Kismet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kismet)!
