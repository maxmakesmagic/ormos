I know that it has been a long time, and I know that a lot of you have been asking for it, so I have decided to bring back the draft walkthrough. Seeing as this week is Feedback Week, I decided to do a walkthrough for a draft that we could all participate in: a ***Magic** 2011* draft with the [Draft Simulator](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/flash/draftsimulator/magicDrafter.html).


[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_draftImage.jpg)](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/flash/draftsimulator/magicDrafter.html)
My recommendation would be for you to do the whole simulated draft first, see what kind of a draft deck you would put together by yourself and then read what I decided to do. Maybe you decided to go a completely different route than I did, maybe we did basically the same thing but wound up being a couple of cards off from each other, or maybe we even ended up playing the exact same 40 cards.

Do the draft yet?


Good!


Now let's see what I did.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pack1.jpg)[Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason), [Goldenglow Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldenglow+Moth), [Volcanic Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Strength), [Sylvan Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Ranger), [Tome Scour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tome+Scour), [Goblin Tunneler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Tunneler), [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), [Incite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incite), [Brindle Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brindle+Boar), [Palace Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Guard), [Howling Banshee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Banshee), [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge), [Demon's Horn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon%27s+Horn), [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)


My pick:



![Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ajani+Goldmane)

We should all be at least a little bit excited as we get to start our draft off with the extremely powerful [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane). [Howling Banshee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Banshee), [Sylvan Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Ranger), [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) and friends are all good, but none of them can really compete with the bombtastic [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick2.jpg)[Wild Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin), [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Yavimaya Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Wurm), [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound), [Phantom Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Beast), [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap), [Whispersilk Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak), [Wurm's Tooth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurm%27s+Tooth), [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge), [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)


My pick:



![Blinding Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blinding+Mage)

[Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman), [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) and [Whispersilk Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak) are the next best options, but neither of them catch my eye in the same way that [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage) does, especially when we already have an [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_fauna.jpg)Even if you think that [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman) is a better card than [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), which I don't necessarily think it is, I would rather go with the [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage) because we already have an [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) that we really want to play. If we take the [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), we will continue to leave our options open instead of pushing us towards the undesirable green-white color combination.


However, if you were playing in a draft where you got to keep the cards, and you really needed that fourth [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman) for your Standard deck, then I think it would make a lot more sense to take the rare.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick3.jpg)[Spined Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Wurm), [Canyon Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur), [Assassinate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate), [Wild Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin), [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), [Gargoyle Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel), [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)


My pick:



![Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Doom+Blade)

[Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Wild Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin) and [Gargoyle Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel) are all pretty good cards, but none of them even approach [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade)'s level. And if a third pick [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) isn't a good sign to go black, then I don't know what is!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick4.jpg)[Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate), [Excommunicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excommunicate), [Merfolk Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Spy), [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), [Wall of Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Vines), [Demolish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish), [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark), [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), [Redirect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Redirect), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


My pick:



![Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deathmark)

The [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) comes in at a very close second for me this pick, with [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) and [Excommunicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excommunicate) coming in as my third and fourth choices.


Because I really enjoy drafting white-black in M11, I'm comfortable pushing myself further along the white-black road rather than leaving my options open with the [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse).


The fact that the majority of decks end up playing either green, white or both makes [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) an excellent way to kill [Yavimaya Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Wurm)s, [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage)s, and any number of other pesky creatures like [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) makes [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) a very attractive main-deck option.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick5.jpg)[Diminish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminish), [Wild Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin), [Goblin Tunneler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Tunneler), [Jace's Erasure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure), [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet), [Tireless Missionaries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Missionaries), [Bloodthrone Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire), [Tome Scour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tome+Scour), [Rise from the Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Grave), [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)


My pick:



![Wild Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Griffin)

[Rise from the Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Grave) is also a very attractive option, but I'm not really in a rush to start taking five-drops this early. There tend to be plenty of opportunities to pick up good five drops, but there aren't always that many opportunities to pick up reasonably-costed evasion creatures.


Given that you can only comfortably play a handful of five-plus casting cost spells, it makes a lot of sense to wait to start picking up your biggest spells until a bit later in the draft.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick6.jpg)[Tireless Missionaries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Missionaries), [Goblin Balloon Brigade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade), [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize), [Blood Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Tithe), [Harbor Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Serpent), [Solemn Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Offering), [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), [Roc Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roc+Egg), [Wild Evocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Evocation), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)


My pick:



![Roc Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Roc+Egg)

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick7.jpg)[Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage), [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize), [Arc Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Runner), [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), [Maritime Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maritime+Guard), [Dryad's Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad%27s+Favor), [Solemn Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Offering), [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)


My pick:



![Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mind+Rot)

The only other card that is really worth noting in this pack is the [Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage), but it isn't a very good splash, and even if I had the mana to cast either the [Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) or the [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) reliably, I would usually go with the [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot).


There are too many opportunities to get blown out with your [Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) for me to want to take it over the old, reliable, [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot).


([Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) your creature, attack. You have a [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth)?—Ouch!)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick8.jpg)[Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), [Incite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incite), [Hunters' Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunters%27+Feast), [Maritime Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maritime+Guard), [Wurm's Tooth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurm%27s+Tooth), [Leyline of Anticipation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Anticipation), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)


My pick:



![Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mind+Rot)

[Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) is the only other card worth noting in this pack, and there's no way that we would want to take it over our second [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) when we are already heavily in white-black.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick9.jpg)[Goldenglow Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldenglow+Moth), [Tome Scour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tome+Scour), [Goblin Tunneler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Tunneler), [Incite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incite), [Palace Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Guard), [Demon's Horn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon%27s+Horn), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)


My pick:



![Palace Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Palace+Guard)

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick10.jpg)[Phantom Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Beast), [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap), [Wurm's Tooth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurm%27s+Tooth), [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)


My pick:



![Celestial Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Celestial+Purge)

Like [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark), [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) tends to be pretty excellent in M11 Limited. While [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap) can certainly be a strong option for your deck to have—the fact that most decks will be playing either black or red (it's really nice to have removal spells in your draft deck, and black and red just happen to be the two colors that have the highest density of removal spells, making them very attractive colors for people to draft) makes the [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) the pick here.


Besides, if we decide we do want a [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap) or two, we will probably be able to get them later.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick11.jpg)[Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)


My pick:



![Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Diabolic+Tutor)

There is some chance that I will play the [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) main deck, and even if I end up leaving it in my sideboard for slower match-ups it will be worth more to me than any of the other cards in this pack.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick12.jpg)[Merfolk Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Spy), [Wall of Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Vines), [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


My pick:



![Liliana's Caress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Liliana%27s+Caress)

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick13.jpg)[Jace's Erasure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure), [Tome Scour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tome+Scour), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)


My pick:

My pick:



![Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grave+Titan)

Yes, yes, yes, yes! The huge, resilient, token-generating mythic rare [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) is the clear pick here. Not only do we get one [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) out of this pick, but now that we have a juicy enough target to justify running our [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), it's like we have two [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan)s!

My pick:



![Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cloud+Crusader)

[Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) is an attractive option, but I already have one of the green- or white-killer and I'm low enough on creatures that I feel like I should take the flying, first-striking 2/3.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick3.jpg)[Diminish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminish), [Siege Mastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon), [Quag Sickness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness), [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion), [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), [Maritime Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maritime+Guard), [Dryad's Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad%27s+Favor), [Solemn Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Offering), [Bloodcrazed Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodcrazed+Goblin), [Bloodthrone Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire), [Ajani's Pridemate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate), [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)


My pick:



![Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Quag+Sickness)

While [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) is definitely worthy of an early pick, right now I'm not sure that I will get enough white creatures to make it really good. And with that in mind, I feel that it's a safer and better choice to go with the aurific removal spell.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick4.jpg)[Phantom Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Beast), [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion), [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker), [Brindle Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brindle+Boar), [Bloodcrazed Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodcrazed+Goblin), [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Holy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Strength), [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet), [Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer), [Roc Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roc+Egg), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


My pick:



![Roc Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Roc+Egg)

[Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) is pretty appealing too, but rather than look to splash, I think it's time for us to start looking for [Bloodthrone Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire)s and [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer)s so we can sacrifice our eggs and make some omelets ... I mean 3/3s.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick5.jpg)[Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), [Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage), [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet), [Tireless Missionaries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Missionaries), [Tome Scour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tome+Scour), [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize), [Arc Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Runner), [Armored Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Ascension), [Chandra's Spitfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Spitfire), [Kraken's Eye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kraken%27s+Eye), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)


My pick:



![Armored Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Armored+Ascension)

The very first pickable [Armored Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Ascension) is a welcome fifth pick for us. The ability to make even a dorky [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) into a dragon makes [Armored Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Ascension) one of the best white cards in the set.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick6.jpg)[Phantom Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Beast), [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker), [Assault Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), [Volcanic Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Strength), [Sylvan Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Ranger), [Cloud Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental), [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap), [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), [Relentless Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Rats), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


My pick:



![Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Condemn)

Given how much we already have going on in the air, and the fact that our curve is currently a bit high, I feel more comfortable taking a [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) that can deal with pretty much any creature that our opponent has the poor sense to attack with than taking the [Assault Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin) which we could use to help pummel our opponents.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick7.jpg)[Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap), [Dryad's Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad%27s+Favor), [Incite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incite), [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), [Elixir of Immortality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality), [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)


My pick:



![Mighty Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mighty+Leap)

At this point I think I would rather add my first combat trick, a [Mighty Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap), to our deck than my first [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), even if I know that we are likely to get a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) tenth as we saw one the second pick of this pack.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick8.jpg)[Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus), [Incite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incite), [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), [Palace Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Guard), [Jace's Erasure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure), [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)


My pick:



![Stormfront Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stormfront+Pegasus)

Another [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)!

[Leyline of Sanctity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)


My pick:



![Leyline of Sanctity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Leyline+of+Sanctity)

I really dislike [Tireless Missionaries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Missionaries) and I don't think that we are going to get low enough on playable that we would have to consider playing it. Instead I go for the rare, and potentially sideboard-able (if we see enough [Lava Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe)s), [Leyline of Sanctity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick10.jpg)[Blood Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Tithe), [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), [Primal Cocoon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Cocoon), [Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength), [Autumn's Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn%27s+Veil), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)

My pick:



![Sign in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sign+in+Blood)

I toyed briefly with the idea of taking the [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran), but I think that [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) is just too good in M11 Limited to warrant passing in this spot as our deck isn't really aggressive enough to take full advantage of the 1/1 Human Soldier.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick2.jpg)[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Assault Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), [Azure Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake), [Barony Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire), [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal), [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf), [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain), [Wall of Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Vines), [Ajani's Mantra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Mantra), [Armored Cancrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Cancrix), [Stone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Golem), [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control), [Chandra's Spitfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Spitfire), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


My pick:



![Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Assault+Griffin)

I'll admit that I hate passing [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) even when there is no way that I could conceivably cast it—especially when I already have something as good as [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) in my deck—but [Assault Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin) is too good of a card for me to feel comfortable giving up on in this spot.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick3.jpg)[Canyon Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur), [Scroll Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Assault Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), [Azure Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake), [Demolish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish), [Merfolk Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Spy), [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran), [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard), [Angel's Feather](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Feather), [Sunpetal Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunpetal+Grove), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


My pick:



![Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Assault+Griffin)

I'm happy to add another [Assault Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin) to my deck, although I wouldn't argue with anyone who would choose to take a one-drop over it in this spot.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick4.jpg)[Spined Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Wurm), [Nightwing Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightwing+Shade), [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), [Brindle Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brindle+Boar), [Palace Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Guard), [Hunters' Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunters%27+Feast), [Maritime Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maritime+Guard), [Blood Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Tithe), [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Prized Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn), [Knight Exemplar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+Exemplar), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)


My pick:



![Nightwing Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nightwing+Shade)

I don't really have an immediate interest in taking a second [Palace Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Guard), and with only a single Knight in our deck, I have no problem passing the [Knight Exemplar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+Exemplar).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick5.jpg)[Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night), [Canyon Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur), [Relentless Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Rats), [Disentomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disentomb), [Pyretic Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), [Bog Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Raiders), [Prized Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn), [Earth Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Servant), [Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


My pick:



![Mystifying Maze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mystifying+Maze)

[Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze) is a more than welcome addition to our deck that has few color requirements.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick6.jpg)[Nether Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Horror), [Holy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Strength), [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet), [Arc Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Runner), [Jace's Erasure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure), [Demon's Horn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon%27s+Horn), [Captivating Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captivating+Vampire), [Ajani's Pridemate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)


My pick:



![Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate)

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick7.jpg)[Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason), [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), [Pyretic Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain), [Ajani's Mantra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Mantra), [Hornet Sting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Sting), [Angel's Feather](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Feather), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)


My pick:



![Stabbing Pain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stabbing+Pain)

At this point I know that I am likely to get another [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) eleventh because we saw one when we were taking our first and third picks—so I'm not too drawn to taking it even if it does combo exceptionally well with our [Roc Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roc+Egg)s. And while [Ajani's Mantra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Mantra) is awfully cute with our two [Ajani's Pridemate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate)s, I'd still rather go for an extra removal spell/combat trick in [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick8.jpg)[Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason), [Bog Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Raiders), [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling), [Excommunicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excommunicate), [Pyretic Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), [Dragon's Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Claw), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


My pick:



![Bog Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bog+Raiders)

I'm not a big fan of [Excommunicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excommunicate), especially when we already have pretty decent removal and a good deal of three drops.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_brains.jpg)So instead ... brains!!!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick9.jpg)[Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling), [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran), [Back to Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+to+Nature), [Traumatize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traumatize), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


My pick:



![Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infantry+Veteran)

While I definitely want a [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) to go in our deck next to the two [Roc Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roc+Egg)s, I'm willing to wait until the eleventh pick when we are likely to pick one up—especially when that means that we get to pick up the aggressive, utility-tastic [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick10.jpg)[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain), [Wall of Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Vines), [Ajani's Mantra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Mantra), [Armored Cancrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Cancrix), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


My pick:



![Stabbing Pain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stabbing+Pain)

Probably not going to want to main-deck two [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain)s, but I could easily see boarding up to two against an aggressive deck, or a deck that's sporting a couple of juicy targets like [Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) and [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick11.jpg)[Demolish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish), [Merfolk Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Spy), [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), [Angel's Feather](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Feather), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


My pick:



![Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Viscera+Seer)

A welcome addition given our two [Roc Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roc+Egg)s.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_pick12.jpg)[Hunters' Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunters%27+Feast), [Blood Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Tithe), [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)

40 Cards 




![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Plains)


















 

The last few cards that I cut were the second [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), [Stabbing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stabbing+Pain), and [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran)


For a while, I wanted to run the [Infantry Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran) over the [Nightwing Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightwing+Shade), but I eventually went with the five-mana flyer. I wanted to run the [Nightwing Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightwing+Shade) because I could see a lot of games going long with this deck, and it is a very good card to have when you have a bunch of lands on the board.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_mindRot.jpg)It pained me to cut the second [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), and I'm still not confident that it was the right choice. I would, however, plan to sideboard in the second [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) in a lot of matches.


What did/would you do differently?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li102_3Cards1.jpg)Would you have taken the [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman) second and gone green? Would you have taken the [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) to leave your options open? Would you have ignored the [Roc Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roc+Egg) plan?


Post your final deck list in the forums to show me, and the rest of the world, a different way that this deck could have wound up.
