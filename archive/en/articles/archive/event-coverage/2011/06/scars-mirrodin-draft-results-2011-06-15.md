Here's how the scoring works: There will be three rounds of Swiss pitting a member of one team against a player from the other team. Your first match win in a format is worth 4 points, your second win 6, and third win 7, meaning that a single player can contribute up to 17 points to his or her team's score in a format. Whichever team has a higher total points after all three formats will be declared the winner!
