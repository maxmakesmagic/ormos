 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 






For the past few years, we've been experimenting with what the Prerelease experience and giveaways should be. And with *Battle for Zendikar*, we've listened to feedback from players around the world to come up with something new that we think everyone will really enjoy.


When you head into the Prerelease to play, what you'll be handed is pretty simple—but it's also incredibly functional and wonderful: this *Battle for Zendikar*-themed box.

You may have been used to receiving boxes like these in the past. But unlike previous boxes, this box is new and improved. It's actually a fully functioning, normal-sized deck box to store all of your cards in!


Check out that D20 storage area on the bottom!

Inside this box are six *Battle for Zendikar* boosters. No seed pack or choice necessary: Everybody gets an identical box to start with. In addition to the boosters, you have the aforementioned D20, a helpful deck building guide and story insert, and the premium foil, stamped Prerelease card!


Prerelease cards are a little different this time around. Instead of getting a specific set Prerelease card or one of a small subset of Prerelease cards, starting with *Battle for Zendikar* players will receive a random Prerelease card in their boxes that can be one of any rare or mythic rare in the set. That's right—even Prerelease mythic rare planeswalkers are possible! This makes for some added excitement with every Prerelease pack opened.


There's nothing quite like a Prerelease—and *Battle for Zendikar* is shaping up to be one of the most exciting ones yet!
