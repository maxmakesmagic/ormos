The April 26, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 26, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Draft Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/draft-weekend). *Amonkhet* is an awesome Limited format, so find [a store near you](http://locator.wizards.com/), read the tips and tricks below, and crush all comers this weekend.


Today's Must
============


1. [A Pick Order List for *Amonkhet*](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/a-pick-order-list-for-amonkhet/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

[Draft Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/draft-weekend) is, well, this weekend, which means ample opportunity to get a leg up on the competition with all of the Draft advice coming your way today. Foremost among those is Frank Karsten's pick order article. He used to wait till after the Pro Tour for these, but with *Magic Online* already firing drafts, Frank jumped on it. And if you're going to take advice from anyone for this weekend, it might as well be a Hall of Fame Pro with 20 years' experience, right?


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Amonkhet* Set Review: Rare and Mythic Rare](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-386-amonkhet-set-review-rare-and-mythic-rare/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

If you haven't already started drafting on *Magic Online* (or, heck, even if you have), this is a good time to polish up on what rares and mythic rares to watch out for when trying to crush the opposition. And this podcast even comes in at a relatively tidy 2 hours, or roughly 87 hours shorter than a normal Limited Resources set review.


1. [Channel Marshall—*Amonkhet* Draft](https://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-marshall-amonkhet-draft/) | ChannelFireball | Marshall Sutcliffe

But why only listen to one thing with Marshall's soothing voice? *Magic Online* hosting *Amonkhet* earlier than the paper release has people rushing to get drafts in and to get those drafts up online, which is telling when it's Wednesday and we already have a number of draft recordings from content producers. Another solid resource for [Draft Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/draft-weekend), so take notes.


1. [*Amonkhet* Draft Guide: Best Commons and Uncommons in Each Color for *Magic: The Gathering*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao0Z5RRxw4k&feature=youtu.be&a) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Clocking in at just 10 minutes, this is a succinct list of the very best of the commons and uncommons you'll see once you start drafting. So if you only have time for a quick refresher before you start cracking packs, make it this 10-minute video.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ao0Z5RRxw4k>


1. [Designing *Amonkhet* with Ethan Fleischer pt 1](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2017/04/26/e091-designing-amonkhet-with-ethan-fleischer-pt-1-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Sean Whatson, and Nate Burgess

Let's switch to Commander for a moment. Ethan Fleischer was the lead designer for *Amonkhet* and is a rabid Commander fan, so the Commanderin' crew scored big with this podcast. And it's only part 1!


1. [*Amonkhet* Best Cards for Commander](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/amonkhet-best-cards-for-commander) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive and Tomer Abramovici

Let's stick with Commander for the moment, as two of the MTGGoldfish crew break down what they see as the best *Amonkhet* cards for Commander. Somehow, [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) only makes honorable mention—and when a seven-mana card says "I win" on it and doesn't make the top of the list, you know you've got some spicy things to talk about.


1. [The Delicate Cycle](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-222-the-delicate-cycle/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

Meghan and Maria talk Prerelease experiences, banned and restricted announcements, and fan-favorite Flavor Text Theater.


1. [The Degenerate's Combo Guide to *Amonkhet*](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/jonathanmedina-04262017-the-degenerates-combo-guide-to-amonkhet/) | Gathering Magic | Jonathan Medina

These quirky combos are quality choices for kitchen-table combat.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Upcoming *Magic* Story Schedule](http://sarkhan-volkswagen.tumblr.com/post/159984951684/howdy-yall-alison-luhrs-recently-dropped-some) | The Dragon Wagon | Sarkhan Volkswagen

After Alison Luhrs [tweeted about the story gap](https://twitter.com/MTGAlison/status/856944830743695360) between *Amonkhet* and *Hour of Devastation*, Sarkhan Volkswagen did the math and laid out the schedule for the next few months.


Note that, yes, this means we're doing another episode of the *Magic* Story Podcast! If you have questions for the creative team—either about *Amonkhet* or about lore in general, tweet them at me [@blakepr](https://twitter.com/blakepr) and they could end up answered on the next episode!


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Black-Green Constrictor](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34981_Big-Picture-Standard-With-Amonkhet.html) | StarCityGames.com | Jadine Klomparens

Remember when the "best deck" in Standard was Black-Green Constrictor? It actually wasn't as long ago as it feels, and it took some serious adjustments to Mardu Vehicles and Four-Color Copy Cat to actually push down the Snek. But powerful decks like this don't just go away—they wait for another piece of the puzzle.


In this case, Klomparens believes she's found a few new pieces to give the deck a boost, primarily [Bone Picker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Picker), a cheap, dangerous flier, especially in a deck that's pretty good at offing things.


The normal power cards are all there—[Winding Constrictor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor), [Rishkar, Peema Renegade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishkar%2C+Peema+Renegade), [Walking Ballista](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista), and [Verdurous Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk)—but they're joined by a few other friends. [Rhonas the Indomitable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhonas+the+Indomitable) is really difficult to *not* have ready to attack and block in this deck, and with all of the ways to kill things, [Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapatra%2C+Vizier+of+Poisons) has a pretty solid shot at making some Snakes.
