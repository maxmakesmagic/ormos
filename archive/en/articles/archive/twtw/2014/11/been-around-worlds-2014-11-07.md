 I just spent a weekend inside the Music City Center in Nashville, TN, talking about one of my favorite formats of all time—Team Sealed. During the stream for the event we would periodically show a graphic about the upcoming Worlds Week in Nice, France. I was struck by two things each time we would show it. The first was how insane the pool of players competing in the World Championship is and what a display of high-level *Magic* we are looking forward to. The second was an expletive-laden internal monologue about how quickly that event will be upon us.





 The second is of little concern to you since it mostly regards laundry, dry cleaning, haircuts, and other items on my to-do list, but the first should be very much inside the overlap-y part of the Venn diagram that illustrates "*Magic* being streamed live" and "things that keep you glued to your computer and/or handheld device." It is going to be *Magic* played at the highest level by the game's very best players.




 Half of last year's sixteen-person field is returning to try and take down the most illustrious title in all of *Magic*—World Champion. Among them is Shahar Shenhar, [the person who currently holds that title](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/wc13/welcome). Shenhar is coming off of a 2nd-place finish at [Grand Prix Nashville](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnas14) with two players also heading to the World Championship: Tom Martell and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. Shenhar was relieved by his finish at the GP after admittedly taking his foot off the accelerator this past season.
