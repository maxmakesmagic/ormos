[Top](#top)

**When does the updated program period start?**
The Rewards Program begins on January 3, 2014, following the downtime. It ends when the downtime begins on December 31, 2014. ("Rewards Program Period").

**Who can join it? How much does it cost?**

This program is open to anyone who has created a **Magic Online** account that is in good standing and meets the **Magic Online** Player Rewards eligibility requirements. We ask for a valid email address (so that we can contact you about the program). The Eligibility Requirements and Official Terms of the program can be found below.


[Sign up for and download **Magic Online**](https://accounts.onlinegaming.wizards.com/).




**How do I sign up for the program?**

If you are new to **Magic Online**, start by [signing up and downloading **Magic Online**](https://accounts.onlinegaming.wizards.com/).


Once you are signed up, or if you already have an account, please read through the **Magic: The Gathering Online** Player Rewards Program Official Terms at the bottom of this page. If you agree to the terms and agree that you are eligible, log into the **Magic Online**  client and do one of the following:

| Current Client | Go to Menu > Settings > Personal Settings. Select “YES, I have read the eligibility requirements and am eligible to participate in the Rewards Program” in the Player Rewards Eligibility section. |



**Why is an email address required?**

First, this is how we verify that you are the owner of the **Magic Online** account that you are receiving rewards for. Your account’s security is important to us.


Second, by having your correct email address (and if you have opted in to receive the **Magic Online** newsletter) we can send you benefit notifications, along with other program information and news items. You can choose not to have these notifications and news items sent to you, but we think you'll find these to be a solid benefit. Your accurate email address is also required in case we need to contact you regarding the status of your account or changes in the program.


If an email is returned due to an invalid email address, we may withhold or cancel membership benefits. Please update any change in your personal information in the **Magic Online** game client or by contacting **Wizards of the Coast** Game Support.

Therefore, please read these Terms prior to participation to ensure you understand and agree. These Terms form a binding legal agreement between you and Sponsor (as defined below) with respect to the Rewards Program.

ELIGIBILITY:**  To be eligible to participate in the Rewards Program, you must be: (1) a legal resident of and physically located in the United States; (2) above the age of majority in your state of residence at the time of participation; and (3) have a **Magic Online** account as explained in our User Agreement [http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std\_adp.php?...](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). The following are not eligible to participate in this Rewards Program: employees, interns, contractors, and official office-holders of Sponsor, and their immediate families (parents, siblings, children, spouses, and life partners of each, regardless of where they live) and members of the households (whether releated or not), and Sponsor's parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, advertising and promotion agencies, representatives, and agents ("Rewards Program Entities"). Sponsor reserves the right to verify eligibility and to adjudicate on any dispute at any time.


**3.SPONSOR:**  The Rewards Program is sponsored by Wizards of the Coast LLC, a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. ("Sponsor") located at 1600 Lind Ave. S.W., Suite 400, Renton, WA 98057, USA.


**4. REWARDS PROGRAM PERIOD:**  The Rewards Program begins on January 3, 2014, following the downtime. It ends when the downtime begins on December 31, 2014. ("Rewards Program Period").


**5.HOW TO PARTICIPATE:**  NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO PARTICIPATE. To enter the Rewards Program, log onto your **Magic Online** account and select your eligibility for this program.


All registrations will be deemed made by the authorized account holder of the email address submitted at the time of registration, and the potential winner may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder for that email address. The "authorized account holder" is the natural person assigned to an email address by an Internet service provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain.


**6. REWARDS QUALIFICATIONS:**  Sponsor will award Rewards to participants based on their qualifying activity in **Magic Online**.


Each player's qualifying activity is calculated at the end of each monthly period and Rewards Qualifications are determined at that time. Each monthly period ends at the start of the scheduled downtime on the end date indicated in the [MOPR 2014 Schedule](#schedule). The next monthly period begins after that downtime is over. Please refer to the schedule set forth in the web rules located at <http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=magic/online/rewards/welcome#schedule>. Qualifying player activity and/or Rewards Qualifications cannot be carried over between monthly periods.


**7. PROMO CARDS:**  Sponsor will add **Magic Online** digital Promo Cards directly to each participant's account based on his or her Rewards Qualifications during the monthly period. The Sponsor will award these cards on a monthly basis. Each Rewards Qualification entitles the qualifying player to a specific promo card. The Rewards are as follows:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Activity** | **Reward** |
| Participate in at least one (1) Constructed, Sealed Deck, or Draft Tournament with a minimum of eight (8) players | Regular Event Participation promotional card |
| Participate in at least five (5) Constructed, Sealed Deck, or Draft Tournaments with a minimum of eight (8) players | Premium Event Participation promotional card |
| Full $20.00 USD spent in the **Magic Online** Store (excluding coupons, shipping, and taxes) | Regular Store Activity promotional card |
| Full $40.00 USD spent in the **Magic Online** Store (excluding coupons, shipping, and taxes) | Premium Store Activity promotional card |

Where appropriate, the rewards will be determined on a cumulative basis, based on the player's Reward Qualifications. For example, if a participant participates in one eight-player Constructed tournament and spends a full $40.00 USD (excluding coupons, shipping, and taxes), that player will earn three promo cards: one regular Event Participation promo card, one regular Store Activity promo card, and one premium Store Activity promo card.


The Promo Cards will be awarded within approximately 15 days of Sponsor's verification of the qualifying activity. No transfer, substitution or cash equivalent for Promo Cards is allowed, except at Sponsor's sole discretion. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a Promo Card, in whole or in part, for another Promo Card of equal quality at its discretion.


**8. TAXES:** The participants and their parents and legal guardians (if applicable) are responsible for ensuring that they comply with all the applicable tax laws and filing requirements.


**9. CONDUCT:** All federal, state and local laws and regulations apply. Failure to comply with these Official Terms may result in disqualification from the Rewards Program.

Further, Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any individual it finds in its sole discretion to be: (a) tampering or attempting to tamper with the operation of the Rewards Program or Sponsor's web site(s); (b) violating these Official Terms; or (c) violating the User Agreement or any other conditions of service, conditions of use and/or general rules or guidelines of any of Sponsor's property or services. Participants further agree to comply with and be bound by decisions of Sponsor, which shall be final in all respects.

Sponsor further reserves the right to disqualify any participant who tampers with the Rewards Program.
