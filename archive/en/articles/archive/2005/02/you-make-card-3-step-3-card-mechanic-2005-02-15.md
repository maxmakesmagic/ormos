![You Make the Card 3](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/You_Make_the_Card_3sm.jpg)The people have spoken and we have a card type. You Make the Card #1 was a [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Forgotten%2BAncient). You Make the Card #2 was an [Crucible of Worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crucible%2Bof%2BWorlds). You Make the Card #3 will pave new ground as an... instant or sorcery. Here's how the voting broke down:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Answer** | **Votes** | **%** |
| **Instant or Sorcery** | 3853 | 43.5% |
| Enchantment | 2507 | 28.3% |
| Creature | 2504 | 28.2% |
| **Total** | **8864** | **100%** |

The next step is making the mechanic. Here are the rules.


1. The mechanic needs to flavorfully represent the chosen artwork. Because this is top down design, this is the most important criterion.

2. You are not choosing whether the spell is an instant or sorcery. Just make a cool effect. The speed will be decided later. I understand that some mechanics by design will have to be instants. If so, I promise we'll figure that out.
3. There is limited space for you to write your mechanics. This was done to keep you all from creating cards too complex to fit on the card.
4. Templating is not mandatory but feel free to use existing cards' templates as a guideline if you'd like to try your hand at templating. The most important thing though is that we understand what your mechanic actually does.
5. We will be determining the card's color later. You are free to use any mechanic from anywhere in the color pie, provided it makes sense with the art.
6. We need three pieces of information from you: your name, your e-mail address, and your mechanic idea. If you leave any of these out your submission will be rejected.
7. Each person is allowed to submit one idea, and only one idea. So make it count. This is done because of the large volume of submissions we receive.
8. The deadline for mechanics submissions is midnight this Friday (the 18th).
9. Have fun! This really is the heart of design, so please enjoy it.

As with the art, it will take us a number of weeks to sift through all the submissions. Once we do, we'll be back with a list of potential mechanics to vote on. I'm very curious to see what you all come up with.
