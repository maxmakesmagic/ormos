[Finals (Standard) Yu Min Yang (vs. Gabriel Nieves (Team Constructed)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/wmc12/finals1)


On paper, Chinese Taipei versus Hungary looked like a slate of mirrors across the board. Zombies in Standard, Jund in Block, and Blue-White decks in Modern.

*Chinese Taipei and Hungary face off in the World **Magic** Cup Semifinals.* 
A closer examination reveals that each team has its own tweaks on the decks. The Hungarian Standard player, Tamas Glied, has adopted Zombie Pod, while his teammate Gabor Kocsis has adopted an aggressive White-Blue [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) deck in Modern that dipped into red for [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix).


Jund, though, was still Jund.


So we followed the Modern match, which had the added bonus of letting us take a look at Tzu-Ching Kuo, who appears on the cusp of Pro Tour stardom, having gone 7–0 on Day One and has more than 150 Pro Points to his name, most recently adding to his total with a 10th-place finish at Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* in Barcelona. He also had blue and white mana in his deck, but stuck with just those colors to leverage counterspells with flash creatures and the power of [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge).

*Team Hungary and Team Chinese Taipei begin their matches on the main stage.* 
### Game 1


A tapped [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) from Kuo met an untapped [Sacred Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry) from Kocsis, showing the difference in their deck styles right off the bat. Kocsis used his to make a first-turn [Steppe Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx), which was sent on a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on its very first attack. The Hungarian reloaded after combat with a [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), flipping it immediately when he revealed a [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand).


That gave Kuo pause, holding Kocsis in his draw step. Knowing [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) was coming, Kuo flashed in [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and used it to send the newly flipped [Insectile Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) on a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile). Kocsis declined to search for land, though, instead choosing to keep the [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) right where it was before casting just a [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) to dig.


Kuo simply attacked and passed, repeating the same move the next turn before Kocsis attempted a [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) on the Mage. Kuo flashed in a [Restoration Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) to save it, using [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) to protect the winged one from [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand).


But the 3/4 lasted just one turn, as [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) removed the flashy flier before Kuo could untap to protect it. Kocsis even had [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to rebuy the [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix), killing Kuo's [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and clearing his board of any nonland permanents.


He did still have a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), however, which he cleared the way for with [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on Kocsis's [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage).


Both players found three-drops soon thereafter: a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) on the Chinese Taipei side of the board and a [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) for Kocsis. While the three-drops stared each other down, Kocsis played and resolved a [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) while Kuo beat down with a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault).


[Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) didn't flip, but the free peek let Hungary shuffle away a dead draw with [Arid Mesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa).


"One card?" asked Kuo.


"One card," Kocsis confirmed. "It's a very good one."


Despite his confidence, Kocsis simply played another fetchland and passed before taking an attack for 5 from both a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). Kuo had clearly decided the time to race was now.


The [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) failed to flip for another turn, relegating it to chump-blocking duty as Kocsis fell to 1 life. He attempted to stay alive with a [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) on the attacking [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), but Kuo used a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) the Helix.


Kocsis, however, was holding another [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). And when [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) hits a spell being flashed back, like the [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare), that spell gets exiled.


So Kuo, still fighting to win this turn, [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed the [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), which, predictably, came back out targeting [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) once more.


But then Kuo revealed his master plan: After tapping Kocsis low, [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) simply removed the [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), negating any life Kocsis might have gained and giving him Game 1.


While that game had taken a while, the other matches were well under way, with Chinese Taipei coming out strong. Yu Min Yang had won his Standard Zombies near-mirror, while Tung-Yi Cheng had won the first Block match. However, in a quick second set, Hungary had roared back in Block to even up the Jund match at a game each.

*Team Chinese Taipei rushed to early first wins across the board.* 
### Game 2


Both players kept their initial hands, although Kuo's was land light and somewhat suspect. He would be relying on just a [Scalding Tarn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) and [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to start, which he knew was tricky ground, given [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) as his only early removal.


Meanwhile, Kocsis put the pressure on early with a pair of [Steppe Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx)es. Kuo [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)ed one, which led Kocsis to try and ramp with a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on his own [Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lynx). In turn, Kuo, [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce)d the [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) in order to keep Kocsis—who had missed his third land—from finding his way out of his own mana screw.


Kocsis missed a land on the next turn, making [Steppe Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) entirely unreliable. When Kocsis tried a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to attempt to burn his way out of mana screw, Kuo responded with [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), one of a number of counterspells in his hand.


The [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) helped him find a second [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), which he used to [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) the second attempt at [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).


Meanwhile, Kocsis was still missing land drop after land drop, even if Kuo couldn't capitalize on it with any real pressure. What he did have was counters in spades, using a [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) to stop [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) from resolving.


And for those of you following along at home, life totals stood at 16–9 in favor of the Hungarian player.

*Team Hungary considers its options in its Semifinal matches.* 
Kuo, looking to end the Semifinals in a hurry—his teammate had just finished winning the Standard match, meaning a win here would put Chinese Taipei in the Finals—played a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) without flashing anything back, just to get some pressure.


Another draw step, another nonland card. [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) did offer the promise of some help, but it was a false promise, as a second [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) flashed back [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) to continue to stymie Kocsis's development. A second [Steppe Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) was ineffective for the time being, but with Kuo now at 8 from a fetchland, any fetchland from Kocsis could prove lethal if Kuo wasn't careful.


Kuo clearly wasn't concerned, attacking for 6 with both [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)s and a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), evening life totals at 8 each.


His plan became apparent when he flashed in [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) in Kocsis's draw step to try and take him home. Kocsis attempted a [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), but Kuo was still flush with a [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare).


It was a good thing too. Kocsis had drawn a [Steam Vents](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) to go with the [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) in his hand. Bolt would change all the math... but then again, so would playing [Steam Vents](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) untapped.


Kuo chose the [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), sending it to the bottom and practically sealing up the win.


Kocsis gamely played on, though, playing the [Steam Vents](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) tapped and attacking with a single [Steppe Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx).


That, however, opened the door for Kuo to play [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), removing Kocsis's only blocker and freeing up a lethal attack.


And with that, Chinese Taipei advanced to the finals of the World **Magic** Cup!
