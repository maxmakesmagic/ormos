Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off some of the recent highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/).

On the Mirran side, a new blog entry has appeared in the Mountains. Farris of the Anvil, a Vulshok leader, tells the tale of a clash with Phyrexian forces.


And over on the Phyrexian side, in the Forest, there's a new wallpaper: Vorinclex, Voice of Hunger.
