**Card of the Day - vendredi 30 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ray%20of%20Distortion)#### Ray of Distortion


 *Odyssey* common.  
One "unwritten rule" of card design is that short, catchy names should be saved for cards that are either thought to be high-impact or have a good chance of being reprinted. Ray of Distortion was originally called "Disarm," and then "Distort," but because it fit neither of the above criteria, it was given a clunkier name, allowing Disarm and Distort to be saved for better cards in the future.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 29 août 2002**

 *Judgment* rare.  
Sometimes Wizards employees who don't work directly for R&D get to design cards. Magic Editor Bill McQuillan created Cabal Coffers, and Creative Text Writer Rei Nakazawa invented Cephalid Constable, which once had the ability: "Sacrifice a basic land: Cephald Constable gets landwalk of that type until end of turn." R&D removed this ability to reduce the card's complexity.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 28 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wolverine%20Pack)#### Wolverine Pack


 *Legends* common.  
The ability Rampage began life as "Berserk" (e.g. Berserk: 3). It had to be changed to Rampage because there was already a card named Berserk in the original set. Rampage: 2 or 3 originally meant that that creature could attack that many times per turn and only the first attack could be blocked.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 27 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Volunteer%20Reserves)#### Volunteer Reserves


 *Weatherlight* uncommon.  
*Weatherlight* was the last set to feature the mechanics banding and cumulative upkeep. Volunteer Reserves is the only card to feature both.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 26 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Karplusan%20Yeti)#### Karplusan Yeti


 *Ice Age* rare.  
The woman in the foreground of the picture was used on one of the Ice Age booster pack wrappers, which is odd because she is not the focus of the card. The yeti itself is between the two main figures, ambushing a third member of their party.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 23 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dream%20Halls)#### Dream Halls


 *Stronghold* rare.  
While not an Alternate Play Cost spell itself, Dream Halls turned every card in players' hands into such spells. While its power was not immediately recognized, it was eventually banned in Standard and Extended and restricted in Type 1 when players started combining it with expensive card advantage cards like Time Spiral.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 22 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Snuff%20Out)#### Snuff Out


 *Mercadian Masques* common.  
The alternate cost was originally 5 life, but it was lowered to 4 in an attempt to make the card playable in constructed formats.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 21 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fireblast)#### Fireblast


 *Visions* common.  
The only Alternate Play Cost spell in *Visions*, Fireblast gives mono-red tournament decks a scary finisher. Many players will breathe a sigh of relief when this card rotates out of Extended in November.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 20 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Contagion)#### Contagion


 *Alliances* uncommon.  
Alternate play cost spells like Contagion are a big reason why Necropotence was (is) so powerful. Instead of being limited by cards in hand, Necro decks are usually only limited by the mana costs of their spells, and "pitch spells" like Contagion circumvent that.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 19 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Misdirection)#### Misdirection


 *Mercadian Masques* rare.  
According to the rules, a spell cannot target itself, so you cannot Misdirect a Counterspell onto itself. The correct play is to Misdirect the Counterspell onto the Misdirection, which will prevent the Counterspell from countering its intended target.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 16 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Commander%20Eesha)#### Commander Eesha


 *Judgment* rare.  
The third and last Aven legend of the *Odyssey* block, Eesha is the only one of the three without an ability that requires you to sacrifice itself. This was done to separate her from her predecessors Kirtar and Teroh, to reflect her (somewhat) more reasonable nature.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 15 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chromatic%20Sphere)#### Chromatic Sphere


 *Invasion* uncommon.  
This card's art is one of the few appearances of Agnate, a Metathran soldier who figures prominently in the *Invasion* block's novels. He spends most of the story trying to avenge the death of one of his fellow Metathran leaders, cruelly slain by Tsabo Tavoc and her forces.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 14 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cagemail)#### Cagemail


 *Judgment* common.  
This card was first concepted as a suit of armor made out of barbed wire. Sure, it grants both offensive and defensive boosts, but it's so restrictive that you can barely move around in it, thus the enchanted creature can't attack. It's good stout mail that holds the wearer like a cage.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 13 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lost%20Order%20of%20Jarkeld)#### Lost Order of Jarkeld


 *Ice Age* rare.  
The art for this cards was originally commissioned for *Legends*, and it was to be one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 12 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cyclopean%20Mummy)#### Cyclopean Mummy


 *Legends* common.  
The Mummy was voted "the most-hated card in *Fourth Edition*" in a consumer survey, and was removed from *Fifth Edition* as a result.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 9 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mountain)#### Mountain


 *Arabian Nights* common.  
Mountain edges out the other four basic lands as the "most printed card" because of its accidental inclusion in *Arabian Nights*. When the decision was made to print the set with standard card backs, all the basic lands were removed, except for one overlooked mountain.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 8 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Repentant%20Blacksmith)#### Repentant Blacksmith


 *Arabian Nights* uncommon.  
The Blacksmith was the first creature with natural protection from red. The ability was considered powerful enough that the Blacksmith was printed at the highest rarity (U2) in *Arabian Nights*. It was reprinted in *Chronicles* and *Fifth Edition* as a common.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 7 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kird%20Ape)#### Kird Ape


 *Arabian Nights* common.  
Kird Ape was reprinted in *Revised*, but was considered powerful enough by the DCI to warrant banning in Extended when that format was created.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 6 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pyramids)#### Pyramids


 *Arabian Nights* uncommon.  
The current Oracle wording for this card includes "2: Regenerate target land," making it the only card that can regenerate a non-creature permanent.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 5 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Guardian%20Beast)#### Guardian Beast


 *Arabian Nights* uncommon.  
While Guardians are mostly white, multi-colored including white, or blue (although only once with Hydromorph Guardian), this is the first and only black Guardian.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 2 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tahngarth,%20Talruum%20Hero)#### Tahngarth, Talruum Hero


 *Planeshift* premium rare.  
Yes, in one version of the *Mercadian Masques* story, the Tahngarth rescued from Rath was an impostor, really Volrath in disguise. This was one of three cards in *Planeshift* with alternate art foils, an experiment that didn't prove popular enough with players to continue. The alternate art comes from Kev Walker's comic strip based on *Mercadian Masques*.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 1 août 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Unmask)#### Unmask


 *Mercadian Masques* rare.  
The *Mercadian Masques* set was originally written as a murder mystery, where players had to put cards together to guess who Volrath was disguised as. But the sheer complexity of the project was too much to implement. Can you guess who Volrath was supposed to have been? It *wasn't* Takara. Or was it? Answer tomorrow!
