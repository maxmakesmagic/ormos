 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






It’s been a month since Grand Prix Shanghai showed off what Standard was up to, and in the interim the format continued to morph. While there were plenty of familiar faces making Day 2 here at Grand Prix Providence, some surprising options made their appearance as well.



This is the complete breakdown of archetypes for Day 2:





| Archetype | Count | Percent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abzan Megamorph | 19 | 14.2% |
| Abzan Aggro | 15 | 11.2% |
| Red-Green Devotion | 15 | 11.2% |
| Esper Dragons | 11 | 8.2% |
| Mardu Dragons | 11 | 8.2% |
| Abzan Midrange | 9 | 6.7% |
| Ojutai Jeskai | 6 | 4.5% |
| Red Aggro | 5 | 3.7% |
| Blue-Black Control | 4 | 3.0% |
| Green-White Company | 4 | 3.0% |
| Abzan Control | 3 | 2.2% |
| Atarka Red | 3 | 2.2% |
| Bant Megamorph | 3 | 2.2% |
| Mardu Aggro | 3 | 2.2% |
| Sultai Megamorph | 3 | 2.2% |
| Bant Heroic | 2 | 1.5% |
| Five-Color Dragons | 2 | 1.5% |
| Abzan Whip | 1 | 0.7% |
| Black-Green Megamorph | 1 | 0.7% |
| Black-Red Aggro | 1 | 0.7% |
| Dragonlord Abzan | 1 | 0.7% |
| Four-Color Sidisi | 1 | 0.7% |
| Four-Color Whip | 1 | 0.7% |
| Green Devotion | 1 | 0.7% |
| Jeskai Tokens | 1 | 0.7% |
| Jund Aggro | 1 | 0.7% |
| Mardu Midrange | 1 | 0.7% |
| Naya Dragons | 1 | 0.7% |
| Ojutai Bant | 1 | 0.7% |
| Red Dragons | 1 | 0.7% |
| Red-Green Aggro | 1 | 0.7% |
| Red-Green Dragons | 1 | 0.7% |
| White Heroic | 1 | 0.7% |
| **Total** | **134** | **100.0%** |


Some features of Standard have held stable since *Dragons of Tarkir* joined the format. Here, Abzan-focused decks account for 28% of the field. It’s not quite dominating, but it makes something packing [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) also unavoidable for players.

While the groups are more nuanced than just four categories, rolling up all of the archetypes does show something important:





| Group | Count | Percent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aggro | 37 | 27.6% |
| Megamorph | 26 | 19.4% |
| Control | 23 | 17.2% |
| Midrange | >48 | 35.8% |
| **Total** | **134** | **100.0%** |


Midrange *is* dominating the weekend. Over a third of the field is playing decks like Abzan Midrange, Red-Green Devotion, and newer flavors like Ojutai Jeskai. Megamorph decks – that is, those using the dynamic duo of [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) – range across the aggressive to more controlling spectrum, meaning seeing the two together doesn’t necessarily make the rest of the deck follow.

However, [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) is more universally played than [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor), making its way into everything from aggressive [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) builds to Abzan and Bant-flavored control decks.



Another card that’s made a move this weekend is Dragonlord Ojutai. While it’s been a mainstay of the fallen-out-of-favor Esper Dragons control deck, others have taken it up as a new angle to going over the top. The Ojutai Jeskai decks use it over something like [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) as its top end; Bant decks generally include a copy or three to cap out its offensive potential, and seeing the white-blue Dragonlord shoehorned into Abzan builds means the Five-Color Dragons technology has trickled down into decks looking for an extra angle of attack.

On the aggressive side, Atarka Red – the mono-red deck sliding in [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command)s and a copy or two of [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) – is in the same boat as the Heroic decks: outshined by the Abzan approach. [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) and [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) alongside [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) is the core troops Abzan Aggro leads with, those the overlap with the megamorph package makes it a fuzzy math to tease out any exact numbers.



Standard is an interesting spot, providing a wide range of threats and plans for players to mix and match from. While that’s put a lot of pressure on control decks –often more things that need to be answered than what’s possible – it’s made the midrange bucket burst with potential. Whether that remained the case as we close in on Top 8 is the question every player is asking.
