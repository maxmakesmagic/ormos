With last weekend's Grand Prix now in the books, the qualification window for [Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/pthou) in Kyoto, Japan, is nearing its final weeks. Starting this weekend, Grand Prix will qualify top finishing players to Pro Tour *Ixalan* in Albuquerque, New Mexico, November 3–5.


However, there are only a few more weekends remaining where players will have a shot at earning their invitation (along with airfare) to Kyoto for the Pro Tour, and it's through June's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers.


Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers Start this Weekend
===============================================


The first batch of Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*'s Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs) starts this weekend, as eleven locations in North America and Europe provide qualified players with a chance to win their spot on the Pro Tour.


The format for this weekend's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers is *Amonkhet* Sealed Deck, with a Booster Draft Top 8 for the playoff rounds. The Top 4 finishers from each RPTQ receive an invitation and a travel award to compete in Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*.


Each participant in this round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers receives an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) promo card as well as a deck box.

The Top 16 finishers at each Regional Pro Tour Qualifier will also receive a playmat.

We'll have a collection of Top 8 Draft decklists for you next weekend from the RPTQs being run, so check back next week for those!


The remaining batch of the 32 Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers will take place next weekend along with the first of two *Magic Online* RPTQs (which has its own set of instructions and prizes that differ from in-store RPTQs, [so check out the event info page for more](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/rptqhou)).
