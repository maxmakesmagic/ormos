It's that time of year again! Wizards of the Coast is proud to be raising funds for Extra Life, benefiting Seattle Children's Hospital—and you can help!


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PyqKJ8GOLo>


As Gavin and Mike discussed today on Good Morning *Magic*, our goal this year is to raise the bar again and raise more than we ever have through a dedicated *Secret Lair* drop, Extra Life streams, auctions for uncut sheets, and more. Keep reading to see a recap of the full slate of this year's offerings.


[Join us](http://extralife.wizards.com/) and support children in need!


*Secret Lair: Extra Life 2020*
==============================


The four premium foil alternate-art cards in this *Secret Lair* drop illustrate the importance of family and children with brand-new art on some of our favorite cards.

*Extra Life 2020* Playmats
==========================


The art on display in *Secret Lair:* *Extra Life 2020* is truly wonderful, and now you can take it with you wherever you play *Magic* thanks to these gorgeous playmats by Ultra PRO. And what's better, each playmat also supports the phenomenal work Extra Life does around the world.


These playmats will be available for $21.99 on [shop.ultrapro.com](https://shop.ultrapro.com/) for a limited time—the same dates as the *Secret Lair: Extra Life 2020* drop, November 6–9. A donation of $16 will be made to Extra Life for each playmat purchased.

Uncut Sheet Auctions
====================


Through eBay for Charity at [ebay.com/wotccharity](http://www.ebay.com/wotccharity), we'll be auctioning off 20 uncut sheets between October 29 and November 7. These sheets range from German *Fifth Edition* rares and lands all the way to *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* mythic rare showcase cards—with an extra spicy *Mystery Booster Convention Edition* sheet to boot!


100% of the profits and fees from these auctions will be donated to Extra Life, so everyone wins!


Streaming Events
================


Our in-house(s) stream raising money for Extra Life will run November 7 from 6 p.m. PT to midnight. Join us on [twitch.tv/Magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) for *MTG Arena* stipulation drafts, a Q&A with Mark Rosewater, Mini *MTG Arena* Ironroot Chef, and more!


Creator Campaign
================


Just like last year, we're also challenging our streamer community to see who can raise the most money for Extra Life. Interested streamers can create Extra Life pages and join the [*Magic* super team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1533) to compete alone or in teams of up to six. The top eight fundraising teams will gain access to codes for their audience, featuring a special alternate-art card style of [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company).
