*This Arcana originally appeared on May 10, 2012.*


This is [Blood Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) from *Avacyn Restored*.

Naturally, the first thing we're going to do is take a closer look at the art.

When it's that big, we can see the artist's painting pretty clearly. Does it look kind of familiar?

Yes, the pose is flipped, but the [Blood Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) is clearly working on [Curse of Oblivion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Oblivion). Except that it's all done in red because that's what happens when you paint with blood.
