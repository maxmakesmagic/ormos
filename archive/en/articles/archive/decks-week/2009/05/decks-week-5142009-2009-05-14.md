Regionals is on the horizon, and it promises to be an exciting weekend! All over North America, thousands of players will bring their best Standard decks to the table in an effort to earn the opportunity to compete at their National Championships. Of course, there's still plenty of time to get involved! [Check out the worldwide schedule for Regionals](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/regionals), plus a first wave of lists from Regionals in Tokyo.
