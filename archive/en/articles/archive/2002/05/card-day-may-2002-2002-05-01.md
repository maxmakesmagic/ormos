**Card of the Day - vendredi 31 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fireball)#### Fireball

 Alpha common.  
The current Oracle mana cost of Fireball is XYR, making it the only tournament-legal card with "Y" in the mana cost. The text reads: "Fireball deals X damage divided evenly, rounded down, among Y plus one target creatures and/or players," and was printed as such in the Beatdown box set.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 30 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Drain%20Life)#### Drain Life

 Alpha common.  
The current Oracle mana cost of Drain Life is X1B. The "X" is now part of the cost to mirror Soul Burn. The card text reads, "Spend only black mana on X," and was printed as such in the Beatdown box set.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 29 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mirari's%20Wake)#### Mirari's Wake


*Judgment* rare.  
In playtesting, this card was known as the "Gardening Glove of Might," an homage to the old-school artifact Gauntlet of Might.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 28 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dirtcowl%20Wurm)#### Dirtcowl Wurm


*Tempest* rare.  
Dirtcowl Wurm was the first prerelease promo card given away. There are actually two versions: one with the prerelease date stamped on the bottom and one where the stamp is on the card type line.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 27 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wormfang%20Crab)#### Wormfang Crab


*Judgment* uncommon.  
To eliminate infinite loops that can draw the game, the second sentence of Wormfang Crab has been errataed: "When Wormfang Crab comes into play, an opponent chooses a permanent you control other than Wormfang Crab and removes it from the game." The change means that Wormfang Crab can no longer remove itself from the game, preventing loops that occur with cards like Upheaval and Balancing Act.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 24 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Giant%20Crab)#### Giant Crab


*Tempest* common.  
Giant Crab was an attempt to make a better version of the *Fallen Empires* Homarid Warrior. By extension, so was Morphling. (Just kidding.)
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 23 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Crimson%20Kobolds)#### Crimson Kobolds


*Legends* common.  
The three Kobolds -- Crimson, Crookshank, and Kher Keep -- are the only cards from the same expansion that are functionally identical. They are all 0/1 red creatures for 0 mana with no other abilities.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 22 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Abandoned%20Outpost)#### Abandoned Outpost


*Odyssey* common.  
The cycle of sac lands in *Odyssey* was originally going to be reprints of the *Fallen Empires* sac lands (like Ruins of Trokair). The design team decided the ability to produced different colors of mana was more important than being able to produce more mana, so these cards were created.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 21 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Aladdin's%20Lamp)#### Aladdin's Lamp


*Arabian Nights* uncommon.  
When the Lamp was originally printed, "10" could not be typeset into one mana symbol. So instead, it was printed as {5}{5}.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 20 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnox)#### Hypnox


*Torment* rare.  
Hypnox removes a player's hand from the game if you play it from your hand. "Play it from your hand" means "play it fair and square by casting it using mana," so Hypnox's nightmare ability will not work if it comes into play via Retraced Image, Elvish Piper, Eureka, Sneak Attack, or any similar card that lets you circumvent its mana cost.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 17 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lu%20Bu,%20Master-at-Arms)#### Lu Bu, Master-at-Arms


*Portal Three Kingdoms* rare.  
P3K featured a mechanic called "horsemanship" that is functionally identical to flying. But unlike flying, horsemanship was given to a large number of red creatures.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 16 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Avoid%20Fate)#### Avoid Fate


*Legends* common.  
Because interrupts no longer exist, Avoid Fate has been errataed to counter instants or enchantments that target a permanent you control, giving the card some usefulness.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 15 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Juggernaut)#### Juggernaut

 Alpha uncommon.  
When the Extended format was first created, Juggernaut was banned for being potentially too powerful. Hypnotic Specter, on the other hand, was not.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 14 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Opalescence)#### Opalescence


*Urza's Destiny* rare.  
Unlike Titania's Song, Opalescence lets the animated cards keep their abilites. Why? Because Mark Rosewater thought it would be cool to attack with an Orcish Oriflamme for 5 damage. Talk about your bad ideasâ€¦
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 13 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cabal%20Therapy)#### Cabal Therapy


*Judgment* uncommon.  
This card was known as "Go Fish" in design because its mechanic requires guessing which particular card is in the opponent's hand. It is based on the legend Nebuchadnezzar.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 10 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=El-Hajjaj)#### El-Hajjaj


*Arabian Nights* rare.  
This little-known character was the inspiration for *Legends*' Spirit Link, which in turn spawned many similar cards, like Armadillo Cloak and Zebra Unicorn.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 9 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Treetop%20Village)#### Treetop Village


*Urza's Legacy* uncommon.  
For awhile, tournament players referred to the Village as "Bobtown." "Bob" was an acronym for "Beats On Blue," since the Village was effectively a 3/3 creature that cannot be countered.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 8 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Liquify)#### Liquify


*Torment* common.  
"Liquify," with an "i," is actually an alternate spelling of this word. The more accepted spelling, and the one that appears first in our dictionary of record, is "liquefy." The Editing Department's policy is to use the first listed spelling, but we made an exception in this case because we figured everyone would spell it with an "i" anyway.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 7 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rofellos,%20Llanowar%20Emissary)#### Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary


*Urza's Destiny* rare.  
Even though he was never referred to on any of the cards, Rofellos was actually a major character in the *Weatherlight* set's storyline. He accompanied Gerrard and Mirri to Crovax's estate, where he was killed by Gallowbraid and Morinfen.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 6 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blood%20Pet)#### Blood Pet


*Tempest* common.  
At the time this card was named, the **Magic** brand manager thought the name was inappropriately dark. The *Tempest* team had to fight to keep the name.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 3 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Crackling%20Club)#### Crackling Club


*Torment* common.  
This is our fourth flavor text variation on the "adding insult to injury" cliche. The others are on Desertion from *Visions*, Wall of Diffusion from *Tempest*, and Undermine from *Invasion*.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 2 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Prodigal%20Sorcerer)#### Prodigal Sorcerer


*Seventh Edition* common.  
The sorcerer is nicknamed "Tim" after the John Cleese character "Tim the Enchanter" from the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 1 mai 2002**

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Giant%20Slug)#### Giant Slug


*Legends* common.  
The Slug's name went through many changes. First it was Slug Bug and then Smeltonian Slug and then the final name was going to be Slaughter Slug. When the word "Slaughter" was typeset it looked like "laughter," and "Laughter Slug" just wouldn't do. So the editors made a last minute change.
