So it's Arcane Week, huh? I guess that means I should construct decks with Arcane cards in them (as opposed to what I've been doing since *Champions of Kamigawa* was released). Let me get right on that: blah blah instant, blah blah splice, blah blah [Dampen Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dampen+Thought). OK, now it's time for something more interesting.


Arcane (capital “a”) is a spell subtype. Arcane (lowercase “a”) means mysterious or obscure. Cryptic. Weird. I can do weird. I can do weird in my sleep.


And so can my readers.


### Probing Question


 



![Psychogenic Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Psychogenic+Probe)

Before getting down to business, I want to post a response to a question about the screenshots I put up [last week](/en/articles/archive/it%E2%80%99s-everyone-else%E2%80%99s-fault-2005-06-07).


> 
> The real question suggested by your MTGO screenshots is, what was your opponent doing with 3 [Psychogenic Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychogenic+Probe)s, a [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot), a [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff), a [Spellweaver Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Helix), and a [Locust Miser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Locust+Miser)? I can think of no synergies between any of those cards.  
> 
> --Ben Allen
>

> 


I'd have responded to Ben, but he didn't include a return address in his email. Poor Ben can't think of any synergies. Well, [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) creates mana. That usually helps you play other spells. [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) is pure defense, and it worked: It completely nullified my army of [Gnat Miser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnat+Miser)s while true Incendiary built up his combo pieces. [Spellweaver Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Helix) gives you free spells. So what are we left with? Three [Psychogenic Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychogenic+Probe)s and a [Locust Miser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Locust+Miser)… while I had 7 [Gnat Miser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnat+Miser)s out. The [Locust Miser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Locust+Miser) belongs in *my* deck, and true Incendiary likes it a lot when I shuffle my deck. And true Incendiary has 5 tapped lands, so he spend ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) on something. And there's a [Bribery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery) in his graveyard, which you can see in screenshot No. 2. (I hope the puzzle pieces are coming together now.) If true Incendiary hadn't drawn especially poorly, he would have easily won that game; I was giving him plenty of extra cards in the early part of the game before I locked him. Luckily for me, [Eradicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eradicate) is a dead card against me and [Quash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quash) is nearly useless as well.


### Let's Get Lowercase “a” Arcane!


I get the craziest mail (and love it):

[Enter the Dungeon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enter+the+Dungeon) says that both players play a subgame of **Magic** under the table. [R&D's Secret Lair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=R%26D%27s+Secret+Lair) says that you play cards as written. And [Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation) — *as written* — says “All players play with the cards in their hands face up on the table.” Uh-oh.


If you get this going, you and your opponent will be *under* the table, but your hands will be face up *on* the table. That makes things difficult. We in R&D (including Mark Rosewater) decided that the best course of action would either be to have some sort of wonky periscope, or to play under a glass table while there's a mirror on the ceiling. You could have a friend there to tell you what cards you've got in your hand, but that smacks of coaching. Perhaps some sort of robot could help…


### The Master Plan



> 
> My Esteemed Mentor:
> 
> 
> Long have I enjoyed reading of your sinister exploits with Magic. You have opened my eyes to sinister combos that make other players squirm. I have chuckled while watching my opponents struggle while I locked down their lands with a Mycosynth Lattice. I have cackled with glee after donating a Summoner's Egg to an opponent with a Phage imprinted. I put a pinky to my puckered lips after locking out an opponent's draws with Chimney Imp.

After playing [R&D's Secret Lair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=R%26D%27s+Secret+Lair), I use [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers) and [Lion's Eye Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) to create a huge amount of white mana, before playing [Ashnod's Coupon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashnod%27s+Coupon), repeatedly cycling it via the Salvagers, to take control of the entire supply of liquid in the world. After doing so, I will setup my own fluid-based economy, doling out meager rations of water only to those I choose. The plan is foolproof!

This is bad news: No one takes over the world but me! It's a brilliant plan, though; I wish I could find a flaw. Fortunately, Bob has the weakness inherent to all supervillains and explained his diabolical scheme to me. All I can do is spread the word — if everyone on earth knows about this, Bob will never find the hapless player he needs to make his vision come true!


### Oh Yes: One with Nothing


So apparently there's some kind of hullabaloo about [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing). People don't like it. Rosewater wrote a column justifying its existence. Let me assure the naysayers out there: Some people like this card. They like the challenge it represents. I've received a few decks that put it to use, so it's clearly got something going for it. Amazing badness is still amazing.



What you may not realize is that [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) is a direct-line descendant of [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus). It's [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)'s grandchild. Alan Comer figured it out, really. [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) is the most broken card of all time: Its cost is ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif), and its effect is 3 mana. It was “fixed” into the aforementioned [Lion's Eye Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond), which added a drawback to [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus): Now its cost is ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) and the cards in your hand, and its effect is 3 mana. But that was still broken and had to be restricted in Vintage. So, again, it was “fixed” into [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing), which merely increased [Lion's Eye Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)'s mana cost by 4 (from -3 to 1): Now its cost is ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) and the cards in your hand, and its effect is 0 mana. To make it a little more appealing, it was pushed to instant speed, and you don't have to lose your hand until resolution. But really — how could a fixed [Lion's Eye Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) be all that bad?


The first One with Nothing deck I saw was posted on the House of Cards message boards a couple of weeks ago. I know not everyone reads the message boards, so many of you missed this deck. It is brilliant, and the best use of [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) I've seen so far. Here's Landman's deck:

*"So in the end, the cheese stood alone?"  

"Yea... he won with nothing!"*


Every permanent in the deck is an artifact or the sacrificeable [Crystal Vein](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Vein). Get [The Cheese Stands Alone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone) on the table, play [Retract](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retract), then play [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing). Victory! My hat is off to you, Landman.



### A Lot of Nothing


Noel deCordova came up with a crazy plan for using [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing). First, put it in an [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter). Then [Donate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Donate) the Scepter to your opponent. Then [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) your opponent and make him use the Scepter and play [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing). If he doesn't immediately concede out of embarrassment and shame, take advantage of the discard with [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) and [Geth's Grimoire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geth%27s+Grimoire)… and, while you're at it, funnel the Grimoire draws through a [Words of Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Words+of+Wind) … while [Warped Devotion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warped+Devotion) is on the table.


Is it efficient? No. Is it a particularly good path to victory? No. Is it evilly delicious to force your opponent to play [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing)? Oh my goodness yes.


### Even More Nothing


Robby Bullis was so enchanted with [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) that he sent me the following email, which is astounding on many levels. I've never seen *Cool Hand Luke*, so I can't vouch for the quotes, though I know what the movie's about (a guy in a prison/chain gang). Regardless, I can appreciate a highly themed theme deck when I see one, and the [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) inclusion is inspired both thematically and mechanically. Robby's explanation of the deck follows at the end.

> 
> The deck is one of those decks that wants to hide behind an [Ensnaring Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) and send direct damage at your opponent. [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) is your best bet at dumping your hand quickly. An empty hand also works with [Mindstorm Crown](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstorm+Crown). Also, and perhaps most importantly, when your opponent plays [Gaze of Adamaro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+Adamaro), you can play [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) in response and say "I OwN you!" Or maybe you don't want to do that...
> 
> 
> I thought the "Shades" might work well in this type of deck, but [Cursed Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Ronin) was the only one who seemed like he might fit into the deck. He could maybe replace the Emissary and could represent Luke. [Night of Soul's Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+of+Soul%27s+Betrayal) also might make some sense. That would be when Dragline comes to Luke at the church.

### And Now, A One-Act Play


That seems like enough arcane stuff for one day, no? Well, no. Pharmalade sent me the following bit of inspired insanity in support of his Kataki, War's Wage deck. (And for those of you at home who think that this kind of thing will get you printed in my column, you're right—*if you're good at it*. Taking a stab at humor often means stabbing it to death. Sending me your combo deck with a simple, concise explanation is almost always the best way to go.)

Then, during the next player's upkeep, they've got to pay 1 mana for EVERYTHING. Their lands, their enchantments, their will to live, everything! Come your turn, pay mana for any creatures you want attacking, then float ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) and sacrifice anything else. Then play [Second Sunrise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). Everything you lost comes back... untapped. All set for a second round.  
> /nutshell
> 
> 
> Now, that should be enough to wipe someone out. Two turns with lands that cost mana to keep is devastating. You can just sacrifice the half of the combo you don't want to keep and keep on hurting 'em with attackers.
> 
> 
> If you want to be truly tricky, you toss in the mistress of ridiculous, Eternal Witless... er... Witness. If you don't pay for her upkeep cost, she'll come back and bring Second Sunrise with her, so you're all set to keep your opponent locked down indefinitely.

> Other support can be found in Yosei, the Skip Your Next Untap Step Star, or perhaps Leonin Abunas, who's very protective of your stuff when Mike's out.
