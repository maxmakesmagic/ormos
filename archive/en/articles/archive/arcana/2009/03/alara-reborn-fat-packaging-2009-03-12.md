Remember when we announced *Alara Reborn* [way back when](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1702)? 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/1702_ARB_620.jpg) *The birth of one world. The death of five.*  
Today we get to show you the *Alara Reborn* Fat Pack. How lucky!

Say, there's quite a bit going on in that image, isn't there? Here's all the stuff going on inside the box:

* Eight 15-card booster packs
* A card box with panoramic art
* The *Alara Reborn* Player's Guide, which contains play tips, story background, and a visual encyclopedia of every card in the set
* A learn-to-play insert
* Excerpts from the *Shards of Alara* block novel *Alara Unbroken* by Doug Beyer
* A pack of 40 *Shards of Alara* basic land
* A spiffy gold-colored *Alara Reborn* Spindown Life Counter, available only in this Fat Pack
