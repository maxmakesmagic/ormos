Last week, Worth Wollpert, Director for **Magic** Digital Gaming, tweeted the ten most owned cards on **Magic Online**. That means, ignoring basic lands, they're the cards which people have the most copies of. He drew the cards out over a week, but now that he's all done with his first round of the [#mtgotop10](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23mtgotop10) list, we can share it with you all in a nice succinct list!


Follow Worth via his Twitter account: [@mtgonline](/en/articles/archive/coming-soon-magic-online-2009-08-25). He's doing another top 10 list and he's down to the #7 most owned Modern card.
