Take a close look at the *Apocalypse* expansion symbol. As the main brunt of the Phyrexian invasion took place during the *Apocalypse* storyline, it’s representative of the mask of Yawgmoth, symbol of the dark lord’s reign over Phyrexia.


![Apocalypse Expansion Symbol](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1389_ApocExpSymbol.jpg)You can see the mask of Yawgmoth in select pieces of card art. Check out Crovax’s knee armor on [Phyrexian Tyranny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Tyranny), or the mask in the center of [Mishra’s Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%E2%80%99s+Bauble).

Now jump forward to post-apocalyptic Dominaria. In *Time Spiral* Block, the story goes that black-aligned knights and wizards were tainted by the lands where Yawgmoth and his minions were defeated. You can see evidence of this corruption in the black ichor that runs out of their eyes. This pattern of black ichor visually evokes the mask, and essence, of the long-dead Yawgmoth.
