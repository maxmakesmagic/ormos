Austria
========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/2015wmc/austria_team.jpg)


The players on this year's Team Austria have had their taste of success before, but mostly at the Grand Prix level. Team captain Valentin Mackl made it into the Top 8 on six separate occasions, while Nikolaus Eigner and Christoph Aukenthaler both have a Grand Prix title to their name. The Austrians had been near the top of the standings all weekend long and they were looking to keep it that way.

Denmark
========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/2015wmc/t8_denamark_team.jpg)


The Danes were an easy pick as one of the favorites this year. Not only did they go into the weekend as the reigning World *Magic* Cup champions, several members of their team had been doing extremely well on the Pro Tour over the course of the past year. Team captain Martin Dang had won Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* and No. 17 Martin Müller had placed in the Top 8 at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. Now they only needed to win three more rounds to become the first repeat champions.

France
=======


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/2015wmc/t8_france_team.jpg)


France won the World *Magic* Cup in 2013, so this year the country is fighting for the trophy once more, but with a different squad. Although most of the players on the French team are relatively unknown, Pro Tour Theros finalist Pierre Dagen is a household name, and the country has a rich *Magic* history.

### Pierre Dagen


**Country:** France


**Hometown:** Paris


**Occupation:** CEO

Guatemala
==========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/2015wmc/t8_guatemala_team.jpg)


Here's one of the famous wild cards we so often see at the World *Magic* Cup. Guatemala made it to the Top 8 largely on the back of their strong Limited game, going 4-1-1 across the two Team Sealed portions, compared to a meager 3-2-2 in Standard. They would clearly need to do better if they wanted to make it past the quarterfinals.

Italy
======


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/2015wmc/t8_italy_team.jpg)


Italy's captain is headlined by team captain Marco Cammilluzzi and WMCQ winner Andrea Mengucci, who both have a Pro Tour Top 8 to their name. This tournament marks Italy's best performance as this event to date, and all four players were feeling confident in Unified Standard.

Japan
======


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/2015wmc/t8_japan_team.jpg)


Going by previous accomplishments, Japan clearly had one of the strongest teams in attendance this year, with No. 16 Yuuya Watanabe, Hall of Famer Kenji Tsumura, and Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* finalist Ryoichi Tamada. However, it looked quite different if one concentrated on previous results specifically at the WMC. Although the Japanese often had had strong teams in the past, they never even made it to Day Two before. This year's team already proved different and made it further than ever. So really there was no reason for them to stop winning now.

Scotland
=========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/2015wmc/t8_scotland_team.jpg)


Scotland always does well at the World *Magic* Cup, having never missed Day Two at this event. Wearing traditional Scottish kilts and under the leadership of the experienced captain Stephen Murray, who is playing his third World *Magic* Cup and has competed in 13 Pro Tours, the spirited Scots defeated Greece in the final match of Saturday to make it to the Top 8.

Thailand
=========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/2015wmc/t8_thailand_team.jpg)


The squad from Thailand may not hold as much premier event experience as some of the other teams in the Top 8, but they made up for that with a desire to put up a good performance at this event. Led by captain Veerapat Sirilertvorakul, who has played at 11 Pro Tours, this tournament marks the first Top 8 success for the Thai team.
