Go to the "Selecting *Eight Edition*" promo page [here](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home).


I received an email from one of my old **Magic** [teammates](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard/strategy/20020716a) regarding the results of one of the previous *Eighth Edition* votes a few weeks ago. "I strongly suspect this is fixed," he said, hinting that the "weaker" card winning was not a realistic possibility in his eyes.


You hurt my feelings. If R&D wanted a particular card in or out of the set, they'd just put it in, and there wouldn't even be a vote. There's no elaborate setup here, folks; all there results are pure 100% public opinion.


That said, hang on to your [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise).




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which cards should be in Eighth Edition? |  |  |
| Birds of Paradise and Vine Trellis | 7385 | 69.50% |
| Llanowar Elves and Utopia Tree | 3238 | 30.50% |
| Total | 10623 | 100% |



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which Spined Wurm art should be in Eighth Edition? |  |  |
| Stronghold | 6191 | 66.60% |
| Seventh Edition | 3099 | 33.40% |
| Total | 9290 | 100% |

You have spoken, and by a 2-to-1 differential, Birds and [Vine Trellis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Trellis) beat out [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Utopia Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Tree). [Vine Trellis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Trellis) will be going into Eighth as the Elves' replacement. Keith Parkinson's [Spined Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Wurm) also cruised to victory.


This week's vote pits two cards against one another that are really quite similar, except one has an extra line of text that tacks ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif) onto the mana cost. So the question boils down to… Uncounterable or no?


*Ice Age*'s [Jokulhaups](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jokulhaups) vs. *Invasion*'s [Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate). Choose your favorite red reset. Should be interesting.


The flavor text submission will be run a little differently. This week, we're accepting submissions for [persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=persecute), which will feature D. Alexander Gregory's art from *Urza's Saga*. But this time, we want *real-world literary quotes*. Here's a chance for all you real-world fans to shine.


Two rules:


* The flavor text should be from a source at least 100 years old, for copyright reasons. The older, the better.
* The source should be clearly attributed, so it can be verified and credited.

You can submit your quote [here](#).


This week's art choice is for a blue enchantment, [Steal Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steal+Artifact). The choice is between John Coulthart's *Fifth Edition* piece, and Peter Bollinger's from *Seventh Edition*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/StealArtifact.jpg)All these votes will be up for two weeks, and don't forget, you can still vote on [Kismet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kismet) vs. [Pariah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah) vs. [Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) and art for Goblin Chariot  [here](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home).
