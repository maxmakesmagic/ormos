Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!


 **Q: I am relatively new to Magic; how can I get better? —Alex C.**  


**A: Mike McArtor, editor of DailyMTG.com**


The best way to learn **Magic** and to improve in the earliest part of your exploration of the game is to pick up [*Duels of the Planeswalkers*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/Digital/Default.aspx). The new version of Duels comes out later this month on XBox, Playstation, PC, iPad, and Android!


Once you've mastered Duels, you can find several advice columns here on DailyMTG to take you to the next level. [ReConstructed](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=reconstructed&description=reconstructed) is dedicated to Constructed deck building, [Limited Information](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=limited%information&description=limited%20information) helps make you a better Limited player, and [Top Decks](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=topdecks&description=swimming%20with%20sharks) and [Perilous Research](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=perilous%20research&description=perilous%20research) provide analysis of current decklists and archetypes.
