In this week's installment of Top Decks, you will find...

  


Let's get to it ... er ... *them*:

So this past weekend in [Chicago](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpchi09/welcome) was a record-breaker for North American Grand Prix, drawing over 1200 players from around the world to shuffle up and compete in the seldom-featured Legacy format.

Since we are talking about a huge jump, nearly half again up from when Steve Sadin and his Billy Moreno-designed Hulk Flash deck took down [Grand Prix–Columbus](/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/gpcol07/welcome) (the last time we saw a big Legacy event in North America), it probably bears speculation... *What makes Legacy so special?* What's the especial allure?

The biggest chunk of answer is that you get to play with lots of cards!
