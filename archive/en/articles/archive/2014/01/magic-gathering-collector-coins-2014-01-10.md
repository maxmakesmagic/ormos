Since this item will make use of real silver in each coin, the pricing will be finalized once we get closer to launch. If you are a retailer interested in finding out more about purchasing these collector items, visit [this page on the New Zealand Mint's website](http://www.nzmint.com/coins/Mtg) and complete their form to sign up.
