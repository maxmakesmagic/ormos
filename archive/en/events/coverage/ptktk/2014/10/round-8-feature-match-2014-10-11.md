It doesn't get much better than this: Hall of famer, five-time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor and currently fourth-ranked William "Huey" Jensen against the reigning 2013 World Champion Shahar Shenhar. The consummate pro against one of the brightest young stars in a match with huge implications heading into Day Two.



 Just another round at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*.




 Surprising no one, Jensen showed up the tournament with a classic take on control, with just a pair of [Pearl Lake Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Lake+Ancient) to finish out the game after using his complete suite of removal and counterspells to run his opponent out of threats. It's an archetype new to this Standard format, but one that is well-represented around the room today. He entered the round 5-2 overall, while Shenhar was 6-1 heading into the match.





*Two titans representing different eras of the Pro Tour fought to secure a better position going into the second day of competition.*
