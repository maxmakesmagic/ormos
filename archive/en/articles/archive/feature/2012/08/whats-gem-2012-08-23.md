Think about [Gem of Becoming](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gem+of+Becoming).

It's not exactly the thing hanging between the horns of [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker), but it's certainly the same sort of thing. So here's the question: why is it a Gem of *Becoming* exactly?Â 



![Pools of Becoming](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pools+of+Becoming)

  
Because it's from the [Pools of Becoming](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pools+of+Becoming) on Nicol Bolas's private meditation plane! The pools have changed a little since we last saw them, but that decaying tower in the lower left of the gem's art looks awfully familiar....
