There were plenty of movers in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings this week, but the headlines undoubtedly belong to someone whose ranking didn't move at all. Jérémy Dezani, [Pro Tour *Theros*](/en/events/coverage/ptthr13) Champion and Player of the Year pacesetter, took center stage at [Grand Prix Vienna](/en/events/coverage/aniol-alcaraz-wins-vienna). He came into the event as the No.-1 ranked player, and it was easy to see why, as he completed a perfect Day One at 9–0. No. 23 Raphaël Lévy was in his first Draft pod on Sunday, as was Pro Tour Top 8er, and [GP Barcelona](/en/events/coverage/bold-band-brothers-best-barcelona) winner, Christian Seibold. The big three went a combined 2–7 in that draft, but Dezani picked himself up and fought his way to his seventh GP Top 8. 

 Defeating Swedish Pro Denniz Rachid in the quarterfinals, and former Team World Champion Robert Jurkovic of the Slovak Republic in the semis, Dezani fell to Spain's Aniol Alcaraz, who denied the Frenchman another trophy shot. Nonetheless, Dezani stretched his lead at the top to fully 10 points, ahead of a veritable Who's Who of US **Magic**. 

 Further down the table, Stanislav Cifka improved a couple of places, courtesy of 14th place in Vienna, while Canada's Alexander Hayne nudged into the Top 10 after yet another points finish, this time at [Grand Prix Cincinnati](/en/events/coverage/boggemes-breaks-through-bearcat-country). Eric Froehlich returns to the rankings this week, entering at No. 22, after his 13th-place finish in Cincy. This week, most of the Top 25 will be taking a break, with Grand Prix Beijing their only opportunity for points. Elsewhere, you can tune in to all the live coverage of the [**Magic Online** Championship Series](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/mtgo/mocs2013). Join us again next week, for the latest updates in the MTG Top 25 Pro Rankings.
