### Rival the Gods


Your path has taken you to Theros, a plane beset by chaos. A mortal Planeswalker has forced his way into the pantheon of gods, who are outraged and threatened by his ascent. Drawing on the power of the god-realm of Nyx, they send creatures of pure enchantment to crush mortal armies. The heroes of Theros strive mightily as they face their greatest challenge: standing their ground against the gods. There can be no peace until the upstart is thrown down.


Here on Theros, you will forge a destiny to echo through the ages. Perhaps you will lead your fellow mortals on the battlefield, bolstered by your courageâ€”or champion the pantheon as they struggle to right the natural order. Embrace your fate and become a legendary hero fit to rival the gods.
