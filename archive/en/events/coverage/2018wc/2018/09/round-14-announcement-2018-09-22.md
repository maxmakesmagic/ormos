Ken Yukuhiro was disqualified in Round 14 of the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.


In Game 1, Yukuhiro drew a [Diamond Mare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diamond+Mare) that should have been in his sideboard. He did not bring this to the attention of the judges when he noticed that he had failed to de-sideboard from the previous round. A judge was observing the game and recognized that the card was from Yukuhiro's sideboard. After a turn had passed, Yukuhiro called a judge regarding his failure to de-sideboard.


As the judge had observed the game and had witnessed the sideboard card not being brought to an officialâ€™s attention upon it being drawn, an investigation was conducted. At its conclusion, Yukuhiro was disqualified.
