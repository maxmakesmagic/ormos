MagicFest Kitakyushu, originally scheduled for May 17â€“20 in Kitakyushu, Japan, has been cancelled due to a Wizards of the Coast scheduling error. We will be working with CFB Events to try to schedule another MagicFest event in Japan later in 2019 and will have more details as they become available.


Due to the error, the planned venue for MagicFest Kitakyushu is no longer available and a suitable replacement was not found in time. Wizards of the Coast deeply regrets the inconveniences this causes.


Players affected by this cancellation who would like to send any feedback should contact [wz-jp-support@wizards.com](mailto:wz-jp-support@wizards.com).
