With the Big One—Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* in Atlanta, Georgia—just a few days away, the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings are set. The Top 10 remain unaltered, with Frenchman Jérémy Dezani leading the way, with Reid Duke at No. 2, and three more Americans—Owen Turtenwald, Ben Stark, and Sam Black—rounding out the top 5. Then there's Shahar Shenhar of Israel, just ahead of Tom Martell, the Japanese pair of Yuuya Watanabe and Shuhei Nakamura, and Hong Kong standout Lee Shi Tian. 

 From No.11 downwards, however, a weekend of Grand Prix action in [Minneapolis](/en/events/coverage/parks-great-scape-minneapolis) and [Warsaw](/en/events/coverage/anteri-completes-his-3-2-1-warsaw) saw plenty of movement. The headline act was undoubtedly reigning Pro Tour "King of the Hill" Shaun McLaren. His [Modern Pro Tour](/en/events/coverage/ptbngs14) victory converted in Minneapolis to a Grand Prix Top 8, allowing him to leap eight places up the table to No. 11. Plenty of other ranked players were in action. Willy Edel finished 10th, while Eric Froehlich, David Ochoa, Lee Shi Tian, and Josh Utter-Leyton all finished in the money. 

 Over in Europe, No. 1 Jérémy Dezani was hoping to extend his lead at the top of the table, but his 7–2 record heading into Day Two couldn't propel him toward another top-notch finish. Most successful in the *Theros* Limited environment was Stanislav Cifka, who finished in the Top 16, good enough for 3 Pro Points. 

 So, with the preliminaries out of the way, [it's Pro Tour time](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/journeyintonyx14), and a veritable mountain of points are on offer in Atlanta. Any one of our Top 25 who makes it all the way to the trophy will find himself 30 points better off, and in the thick of the Player of the Year race, that will increasingly be our focus as we head down the stretch of this Pro season. Join us next week for a comprehensive roundup of all the ups and downs in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
