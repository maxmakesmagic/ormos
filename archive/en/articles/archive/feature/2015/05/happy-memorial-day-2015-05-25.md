Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Here in the United States we're celebrating Memorial Day, a holiday meant to remember the people who died while serving in the armed forces. As such, we're taking the day off to be with friends and family. We do have one [article for you from Alli Medwin](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-design-modern-mastery-2015-05-25) on the *Magic Online* design work that went into *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*, but our regular schedule resumes tomorrow.


We'll be back tomorrow with a combination of our Monday and Tuesday lineups: Making Magic, Level One, and Reconstructed will all run. From the Lab and Serious Fun are taking the week off to eat hotdogs.


See you tomorrow!
