*Kamigawa* Flashbacks Start Tomorrow
------------------------------------


What do Spirits, arcane spells, bushido, and Samurai have in common? That's right! None of them are types of food! . . . what? Oh, right, they're also all pillars of the world of Kamigawa. Tomorrow (Wednesday, May 30) kicks off a week of *Champions of Kamigawa*-*Champions of Kamigawa*-*Betrayers of Kamigawa* Flashback Drafts on *Magic Online*. Find them in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby, and start soulshifting your way to victory. Or something.


*Ixalan* Block Redemptions Returning
------------------------------------



Due to demand, we have reordered stock for regular *Ixalan* and *Rivals of Ixalan* redemptions. (Premium redemptions are no longer available.) We don't yet know the exact date the new stock will be available, but we'll announce as soon as we have more information.



Streamer Showdown, Plus Brawl Returns!
--------------------------------------


This Thursday, a very cool thing is happening: another Streamer Showdown! Thursday, May 31, at 1 p.m. PT, eight beloved *Magic* personalities will battle it out in a casual, entertaining tournament streamed live for your enjoyment. On a related note, something else cool is happening tomorrow (May 30): Brawl events are returning to *Magic Online*. For this Showdown, the streamers will be Brawling it out, so get ready for some weird, creative uses of the Standard card pool.


If you've never watched one before, Streamer Showdowns are eight-player events featuring talented streamers from all across the *Magic* community. The players (and their Brawl commanders) are detailed below:

Article Coming Tomorrow from Lee Sharpe
---------------------------------------


We're changing up a few things in the *Magic Online* world around here. We can't tell you what those are quite yet—this blurb is intended only to torment you with a lack of information! Well, and to tell you that all will be revealed tomorrow, on this website, via an article by Lee Sharpe. Keep an eye out.


Team Standard Super League Tonight
----------------------------------


The latest offering in our roster of Team Super League shenanigans is Team Standard Super League. The format is a bit different from the "Conqueror" rules used for TMSL and TVSL, but the basics are the same: team-wide deck-building restrictions, rotating players, and weekly elimination tournaments. See what kinds of crazy brews these teams bring to the table in the world of *Dominaria* Standard!


TSSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).


Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!



TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).



Two PTQs This Weekend
---------------------


**Saturday, June 2**:Standard, beginning at 9 a.m. PT. Players may enter with 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points. **Sunday, June 3**:*Dominaria* Sealed Deck, beginning at 7 a.m. PT. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required to join this event. The winner of each event will qualify for Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica* this fall.


*Magic Online* Format Challenges Every Weekend
