Events
------


EVENT TYPES
===========





















Officially sanctioned events offer a variety of opportunities to play Magic. Even better, they create a place to meet new friends who enjoy the game just as much as you.


You can find small gatherings of players who just want to play against others who love the game. Or join large-scale multi-day tournaments and see how you rank against those who take their passion for Magic to the competitive stage.


Whether you’re trying to break onto the Pro Tour or are new to Magic, Organized Play has something for you. Read on to learn about your options.
