The numbers are in. My colleague Meghan Wolff and I went through all 425 decklists, looking for patterns, categorized them, re-categorized some, and tallied up the totals.


Going into the weekend, the two most expected archetypes had been black-green decks on one hand and those featuring the combo of [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) and [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) on the other. Of course, this being the Pro Tour in preparation of which the world's best players tested with their teammates in absolute secrecy, one kind of had to expect the unexpected as well.


So how did expectations square with the actual results?

Mardu Vehicles, huh?


Several big teams had arrived at this deck choice. The theory behind it was that many more players would try control decks, now that bannings had taken out [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter), [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End), and White-Blue Flash. Meanwhile, testing indicated that aggressive decks with Vehicles were still well equipped to overpower control strategies, and that [Heart of Kiran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) was a fair replacement for the verboten Copter. Plus, as one former Pro Tour champion pointed out, [Heart of Kiran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) matched up nicely against [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai). With the skyship poised to strike, no one could ever just play [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) and expect the Planeswalker to live for a turn, effectively turning the combination with [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) from a turn-four into a turn-five combo.


Mardu Vehicles on top of this list might be considered somewhat misleading though. If one were to add up, for instance, all the [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai)/[Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) decks, quite a different picture would form.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copy Cat Variants | 105 | 24.7 |
| Jeskai Copy Cat Control | 72 | 16.9 |
| Four-Color Copy Cat | 25 | 5.9 |
| Four-Color Aetherworks Copy Cat | 8 | 1.9 |

All of a sudden, Copy Cat claims the number one spot, with almost a quarter of the field employing the two-card combination in one form or another. The most popular shell for it was a regular Jeskai Control deck which would try to control the game with removal spells and countermagic and the occasional 1/4 blocker until it was time to wrap things up with an arbitrarily large number of Cats.


The other versions of the deck, all of them adding green, didn't all go all out on the combo either. Their players would often just keep the opponent busy with things like [Rogue Refiner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Refiner) and [Whirler Virtuoso](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirler+Virtuoso), get an additional trigger out of these creatures via [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian), and wait for an opening. Many of them included [Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend) to create such an opening, and a few took the energy theme one step further and incorporated [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel).




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Black-Green Based Decks | 104 | 24.5 |
| Black-Green Constrictor | 66 | 15.5 |
| Black-Green Delirium | 31 | 7.3 |
| Jund Constrictor | 5 | 1.2 |
| Four-Color Constrictor | 2 | 0.5 |

Getting bogged down in the Swamp of details, one can't see the Forest for the trees. Meaning, the sum of all black-green creature decks also came to about a quarter of the field. [Winding Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor) eclipsed [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer) as the two-drop of choice here, as did [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista). Delirium no longer played a significant part in most of these decks. Instead, everyone's favorite Snake climbed the ladder and granted additional +1/+1 counters and, every so often, additional energy counters.


That last part was the reason why we got to see several players branch out into further colors. After all, when you already work with, say, [Longtusk Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longtusk+Cub) and [Greenbelt Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenbelt+Rampager), you might as well add [Attune with Aether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether) and [Harnessed Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harnessed+Lightning). One team did so, while two others splashed [Skyrider Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyrider+Elf) and [Tamiyo, Field Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+Field+Researcher), the latter helped along by [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa).

| Blue Control | 55 | 12.9 |
| Blue-Red Control | 15 | 3.5 |
| Grixis Control | 14 | 3.3 |
| Jeskai Control | 13 | 3.1 |
| Blue-Black Control | 6 | 1.4 |
| Esper Control | 5 | 1.2 |
| Four-Color Control | 1 | 0.2 |
| Sultai Delirium Control | 1 | 0.2 |

Proper control—you know, removal and counterspells, preferably at instant speed, card draw and very little focus on winning options—was the fourth most popular macro archetype (behind Copy Cat, Black-Green, and Vehicles). At only a little more than an eighth of the field, this was not exactly a major player in the metagame, but several major teams had decided to bring blue control decks.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-Vehicle Aggro Decks | 18 | 4.2 |
| Black-Red Aggro | 9 | 2.1 |
| Black-Red Zombies | 4 | 0.9 |
| Red-White Humans | 2 | 0.5 |
| Jund Aggro | 1 | 0.2 |
| Jund Energy Aggro | 1 | 0.2 |
| Red-Green Energy Aggro | 1 | 0.2 |

Aside from the ubiquitous Vehicle decks, other forms of beatdown were quite rare. Humans getting a [Metallic Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Mimic) to go along with their [Thalia's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%27s+Lieutenant)s still was something to note. [Cryptbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptbreaker) wanted to let us know that it wasn't dead yet, despite the loss of [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter), just as undead as ever. But the biggest news here were that Black-Red Aggro now often had [Weldfast Engineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weldfast+Engineer) crew [Heart of Kiran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran).




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Improvise Decks | 11 | 2.6 |
| Grixis Improvise | 7 | 1.6 |
| Blue-Black Improvise | 3 | 0.7 |
| Four-Color Improvise | 1 | 0.2 |

Lastly, I wanted to draw the attention to this improv group. At least one team of noteworthy players had been working to get the most out of the new keyword ability in all three of its colors, while one famously innovative player led the charge in the blue-black department.


Of course, there's a lot more going on in Standard here in Dublin, like Green-White Tokens, admittedly more focused on +1/+1 counters nowadays, possibly returning to former glory. Or White-Blue Flash still being around, despite the loss of [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) and [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage). Naturally, one could draw the lines differently and combine some of the above mentioned into different groups too.


Copy Cat, Black-Green, and Vehicles together accounted for roughly three quarters of the metagame, blue control decks for another eighth, and a slew of interesting inventions, updates, and comebacks bringing up the rear: That's your Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Standard metegame in a nutshell.
