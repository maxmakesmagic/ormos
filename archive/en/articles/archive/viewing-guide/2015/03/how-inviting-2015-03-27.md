*Dragons of Tarkir* is now available in stores worldwide! And speaking of the new set, you'll have your first opportunity to watch the new cards in action this weekend! And after that, you'll have the regularly scheduled *Magic* programming to look forward to.

[StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/) is hosting its first Open Series weekend featuring the Invitational this weekend in Richmond, Virginia. In fact, the Invitational starts today, and features four rounds of Standard—with *Dragons of Tarkir* legal—as well as four rounds of Legacy.



This means three days of coverage featuring both formats in action. More Standard will be on its way to you as well, since the Open Series event running in Richmond is Standard. If you're looking for your initial Standard Constructed ideas, then this is one weekend of SCGLive coverage that you won't want to miss.



Join Patrick Sullivan, Matthias Hunt, and Cedric Phillips along with the rest of the SCGLive crew as they bring you three days of StarCityGames Open Series and Invitational coverage starting today on the [SCGLive Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive) at 11:30 a.m. local time (ET)/8:30 a.m. PT/3:30 p.m. GMT. Coverage will resume on both Saturday and Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (ET)/6 a.m. PT/1 p.m. GMT.

Meanwhile, the [Vintage Super League](http://VintageSuperLeague.com/) wraps up its last week of round-robin matches before the cut to the Top 4. Going into this final week, the roster of players moving on to post-season play is already set. However, those players are still jockeying for place in the post-season, so this last week may have a big impact on how easy or how hard it will be for the post-season players to win the whole thing.



On the flip-side, this week means a *lot* for the other six. While David Williams needs a win to not get kicked out of the league, the five players sitting at 3-5 can't lose either. If they do, and if Williams wins, then there will be a post-season playoff to see who is eliminated from returning next season!



Join host Randy Buehler and the rest of the Vintage Super League crew for Vintage goodness! It all starts on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) Tuesday, March 31, at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. GMT...
