For a little fun, we asked around for cool stories about some of the more creative cards doing something spectacular in Limited. Did anyone see [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir) in action, have a massive [Electrostatic Pummeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Pummeler) do a bit of pummeling, or go deep with [Madcap Experiment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Madcap+Experiment) or [Dubious Challenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dubious+Challenge)?

**Hall of Famer Bram Snepvangers:** I try not to play these cards. I guess, [Dubious Challenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dubious+Challenge) might work if you have a lot of bounce ...

**Pro Tour Prague 2006 quarterfinalist Quentin Martin:** I hope I get the chance! I've always loved making some wacky, underrated rare work. Like when you used to get [Mindmoil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindmoil) as a fifteenth pick. In this format, so far, the best I've done was to draw my own [Chief of the Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Foundry), steal my opponent's with [Confiscation Coup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscation+Coup), and copy both with [Saheeli's Artistry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli%27s+Artistry) ...

**2016 World Championship finalist Márcio Carvalho:** Doesn't involve any weird card, but my first loss [yesterday] was against turn one [Mana Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Vault), turn two [Verdurous Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk). How do you beat an 8/8 with trample on turn two?

**Grand Prix Rimini 2016 champion: Arne Huschenbeth:** I once lost against a Draft deck with two [Panharmonicon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon)s, three [Cloudblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer)s, two [Visionary Augmenter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visionary+Augmenter)s, [Angel of Invention](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Invention), and [Wispweaver Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wispweaver+Angel). I am not making this up.

**24-time Grand Prix Top 8er Martin Jůza:** I was gonna build an [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) deck in Sealed! I had so many great enablers and cross synergies, but my pool simply had nothing big to marvel into. The largest creature was a 4/5. If I'd had anything, any Gearhulk basically or better yet [Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus), my deck would have looked something like this:
