Trials for individual-format Grand Prix tournaments award a three-round bye to a Grand Prix tournament for one or more of the top-finishing competitors.

Grand Prix Trial byes do not pass down - if a player already possesses a three-round bye, finishes high enough to win another bye from a Grand Prix Trial, that bye will not be passed down to the next eligible player.
