Welcome to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. In some ways, this is a very "small" week. In other ways, it's just huge! But importance doesn't dependent on physical scale alone. In those terms, the continuation of the European Grand Prix season with [Grand Prix Prague](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-prague-2015) should provide plenty of spectacle. However, it's unlikely to cause much change in the rankings. Why? Because Josh Utter-Leyton, Ben Stark, Matt Sperling, Andrew Cuneo, and William Jensen are all from North America, and they're unlikely to make the transatlantic trip. But what about the other 20 in our Top 25? Well. . .


In case you missed the memo, it's time for the World Championship, and that means the best of the best will be going at it across three days of action here in Seattle, at the home of PAX Prime, the world-famous gaming convention. The 24 competitors will face three rounds of *Modern Masters (2015 Edition)* Draft; four rounds of Modern; three rounds of *Magic Origins* Draft; and four rounds of Standard—all before the final four return on Sunday to compete in Standard once again to find a World Champion.


In every round, the winner of each match gains one Pro Point towards their 2015-2016 season total. That means that an 8-6 record across the fourteen rounds is equivalent to winning a Grand Prix! Earning those wins is going to be incredibly tough, with Hall of Fame pros, World Champions, Players of the Year, and Pro Tour winners waiting on the other side of the table. When the trophy is finally raised, it's likely that the landscape of our Top 25 will be radically altered. Find out exactly how the World Championship impacts Eric Froehlich and the rest of the field when we return seven days from now for another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
