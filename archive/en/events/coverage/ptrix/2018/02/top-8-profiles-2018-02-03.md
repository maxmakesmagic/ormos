**Name:** Luis Salvatto


**Age:** 29


**Hometown:** Lujan, Buenos Aires, Argentina


**Team:** Hareruya Latin


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**


Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* Top 8; 5 Grand Prix Top 8s (1 win, 1 finals)


**Limited Record:** 5-1


**Modern Record:** 8-2


**What archetypes did you draft? Which was your favorite?**


Green-White Dinos, Blue-Black-white Ascend. Ascend is the most fun and if you do well, it's also too powerful.


**What's the key to drafting *Rivals of Ixalan/Ixalan*?**


Identify what archetype is open fast, and go for it.


**What Modern deck are you playing and why? How long have you been playing it?**


Lantern Control. Thanks to Pedro Carvalho, who lent me the entire deck to stop me from playing 8-Rack. I played it for a few months of *Magic Online*.


**Modern has a wide-variety of strange and difficult matchups. What decks in the format are your rivals?**


Discard and permanent disruption (non-creatures)


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


Another gift from life—having success doing what you love. That means happiness!

G/U splash red and U/B splash white. I liked the one I won more matches with.


**What's the key to drafting *Rivals of Ixalan/Ixalan*?**


Blue is the best bridge color. All of the strategies are viable, so if I start with blue cards, I know my deck will be good.


**What Modern deck are you playing and why? How long have you been playing it?**


Mardu Pyromancer. 2-2, dropped a league with it. Mattia Rizzi gave me a list and Korey McDuffie would have played it.

Always Tron


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


That Korey McDuffie chose the right mentor.

Good two drops with a solid curve

Blue-Red Pyromancer, because you get so much card selection. Been playing it since my brother Peter told me about it.

Eldrazi Tron is bad, control matchups feel good. The rest is about even, with a lot of play to it.

It would be awesome!

**Name:** Jean-Emmanuel Depraz


**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Paris, France


**Team:** Magic Corporation


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 1st Place at GP Warsaw


**Limited Record:** 6-0


**Modern Record:** 6-3-1


**What archetypes did you draft? Which was your favorite?** 


W/B Vampires and Grixis Control. Vampires are the best, but the wacky control deck was definitely more fun to play.


**What's the key to drafting *Rivals of Ixalan/Ixalan*?**


Go black. Darkness is your friend.


**What Modern deck are you playing and why? How long have you been playing it?**


5-Color [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow), because it fits my playstyle and has game against the whole format despite its diversity. I've been playing it for about a year now.


**Modern has a wide-variety of strange and difficult matchups. What decks in the format are your rivals?**


Dredge and midrange decks with main-deck [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls).


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


Another dream come true.

I missed the chance in Madrid two years ago. I would love to finally realize it.
