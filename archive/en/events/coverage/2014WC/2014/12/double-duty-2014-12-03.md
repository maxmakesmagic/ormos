 Eleven of the Championship competitors have a long week ahead of them. Being among the best of the best earned them more than a spot at the game's most prestigious tournament. It also meant that each would be tasked with leading their National Team during the 2014 World *Magic* Cup on Friday. They can't even enjoy the luxury of a day off, because Thursday's "day off" is really the last chance to make sure everyone's ready for the trials ahead. How do you balance preparing for the year's most important individual tournament with the responsibilities of being a captain?
