As explained in this week's [announcement](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/159b) by Mike Turian, the long-running Elo rating system that has been in place since the beginning is being replaced by a new system called Planeswalker Points. It is going to completely change the way your rating works and who gets invited to Pro Tours, and it will make Friday Night **Magic** more meaningful than it has ever been since it was introduced way back in 2000.
