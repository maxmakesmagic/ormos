*This Arcana originally appeared on March 29, 2012.*

Years ago, there was a magazine called *Duelist*, and it was all about **Magic**. Its covers were frequently adorned with brand new paintings, like this alternate view of [Phyrexian Negator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5559) by [Carl Critchlow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Carl+Critchlow%22%5D):

Well, guess what? We recently found the files for the original art for a few of these covers. So here, for the first time, is this neat Negator without all those pesky words all over it!

Now that we've established the theme of what we're doing here, here's Duelist #38:

That art is an alternate version of [Hammer of Bogardan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3452), done by [Ron Spencer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Ron+Spencer%22%5D), the man who did the original. And here it is without the words getting in the way!
