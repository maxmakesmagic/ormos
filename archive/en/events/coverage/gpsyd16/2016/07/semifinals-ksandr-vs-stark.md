Fresh-faced Jan Ksandr faced off against Pro Tour warrior Ben Stark in the semifinals of GP Sydney. The two were perfect examples of opposite ends of the Pro Tour spectrum; Ksandr had recently secured his first Pro Tour berth, and with his first Grand Prix Top 8, had just secured a second. On the other side, Stark already had four Pro Tour Top 8s under his belt, including a win at Pro Tour Paris in 2011, and is in the Pro Tour Hall of Fame.


Ksandr drafted a Blue-Black control deck with a variety of end-game options. In building his deck he considered cards like [Voldaren Pariah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voldaren+Pariah), [Nephalia Moondrakes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Moondrakes) and [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End). This included a [Tamiyo, Field Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+Field+Researcher) splashed off two [Terrarion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion), a [Foul Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul+Orchard), and one lonely Plains. "I'm not sure if it's good, but it might work," Ksandr had said.

Stark, on the other hand, had a more traditional aggressive Red-White deck, featuring three [Ride Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ride+Down)s. "I think it's fine," he said prior to the games. "It's aggressive, the curve is fine, and there's plenty of ways to get through."


In Game 1 Stark started off aggressively, but Ksandr's [Tooth Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+Collector) killing Stark's [Devilthorn Fox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devilthorn+Fox) slowed him down. Ksadnr pushed his advantage with [Stitchwing Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitchwing+Skaab) and [Advanced Stitchwing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advanced+Stitchwing). Stark attacked into the [Advanced Stitchwing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advanced+Stitchwing) with a [Dawn Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Gryff), then used one of his three [Ride Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ride+Down)s to finish it off.


Ksandr mulled his options while tapping his foot endlessly under his chair. Ksandr chose to recur his [Advanced Stitchwing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advanced+Stitchwing), discarding two cards. Stark went on the defensive, summoning a [Sigardian Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigardian+Priest). But it wasn't enough, with a Pale Rider on Ksandr's side of the board helping to close out the game.

In Game 2, Stark launched off quickly with a turn-one [Insolent Neonate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insolent+Neonate) against Ksandr's [Terrarion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion), but had no apparent Turn 2 play. Ksandr called on the dark arts to summon a [Wailing Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wailing+Ghoul), but at the end of Ksandr's turn Stark cashed the Neonate in for a [Bloodmad Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodmad+Vampire). The vampire attacked, the zombie blocked, but a [Ride Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ride+Down) from Stark killed the braineater and added a counter to the vampire. Stark continued to apply pressure while Ksandr found himself stuck on three lands, and eventually pings from a [Thermo-Alchemist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermo-Alchemist) and [Cryptolith Fragment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Fragment) mean Ksandr had no outs to recover.


Ksandr elected to play again Game 3. A fast [Thraben Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Gargoyle) and [Tooth Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+Collector) from Ksandr help him stabilise against the aggressive Stark. Although they traded evenly for a while, it became clear Stark's deck couldn't get the momentum it needed to race the control deck. A [Dark Salvation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Salvation) for two put Stark well behind, and when Ksandr used [Terrarion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion) to cast [Tamiyo, Field Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+Field+Researcher) and tap down Stark's remaining team, it was clear the writing was on the wall. Shortly after Stark offered the hand.


**Ksandr won, 2-1, and moved onto the finals of GP Sydney.**
