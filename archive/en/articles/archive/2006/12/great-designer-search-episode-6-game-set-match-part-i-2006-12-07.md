The Great Designer Search Episode #6 “Game, Set, Match”, Part I
===============================================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles?source=MX_Nav2020)
 on December 3, 2013 










After many weeks, we’re finally coming into the home stretch. At the end of this challenge, we’ll be down to the Final Three that will be flown to Wizards of the Coast for a formal interview. Who will that be? Before we can find that out, we need to first take a look at this week’s Design Challenge (#5 for those who are counting). Here is what we sent the applicants:



> 
> Dear Applicants,
> 
> 
> Congratulations – You have advanced past another round!
> 
> 
> Welcome to Design Challenge #5. I call this one “Game, Set, Match.” This is the challenge that will decide who is in the Final Three and gets flown out to Renton, Washington to visit Wizards of the Coast and interview with R&D.
> 
> 
> This is the most important Design Challenge yet and thus is the hardest one. What do you need to do? Design a small 180 card set. You have 72 hours. Go.
> 
> 
> What? Too hard? Come on, this is The Great Designer Search. Okay, okay. You don’t need to turn in all 180 cards. Just pick a color and turn in the commons. We’ll assume the set has a common land cycle so that means you’ll have to turn in 11 cards. Once again, the color is completely up to you.
> 
> 
> Oh yeah, also give me the prerelease card. This should be a splashy, straightforward, Timmy-leaning (and yes, I dare say sexy) rare that is intended to be representative of the set and given away at the prerelease.
> 
> 
> Besides the normal things we look for, here are the things we’re going to be looking for on this particular challenge:
> 
> 
> - Are your commons all common?  
> 
> - Are they representative of the set?  
> 
> - Do they show off what your set has to offer?  
> 
> - Do they hint at what shows up elsewhere in the set?  
> 
> - Do they fill all the roles of small set commons in this color?  
> 
> - Is your prerelease card rare?  
> 
> - Is it splashy/sexy?  
> 
> - Is it a good prerelease card?
> 
> 
> This task is by far the hardest task we’ve given you. I recommend you pick out some small sets and just look at the commons of one color and the prerelease card for that set. See how we do it. Use it as a guide. Write an explanatory paragraph at the end, no longer than 150 words.
> 
> 
> I’ll see three of you in a few weeks.
> 
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> 
> Mark Rosewater
> 
> 
> 


Even though I mention this multiple times in the challenge itself, I believe this is the hardest Design Challenge yet. While on the surface it might seem like the candidates just have to design twelve cards, this isn’t the case. The applicants have to figure out the basic structure of an entire small expansion. Yes, they don’t have to design every card but they do need to understand what the larger set is about as their commons have to hint at it. In addition, while commons might seem like the easiest cards to make, they are in fact the hardest. Commons have many more restrictions that cards at other rarities. Plus, the applicants have to use them to show off what the set is all about. Trust me, this challenge was harder than any that came before it.


So how did our five remaining applicants do? Let’s take a look.

Part of design is recognizing strong ideas and expanding on them.  

Thus far, the Merfolk Traders ability (draw and discard) has been used only sparingly. However, it can make an excellent block ability to smooth out draws, just as cycling or morph have done in the past.  

For my submission, I have created the common white cards of the second set of the block following the repair of Dominaria's time line. This block investigates new beginnings and letting go past assumptions, and the Trader ability is a perfect fit. The first set focused on the exploration of this new world; this second set spotlights the rebuilding process, and using relics from the past to fashion a new culture. Tilth shows this in action, as it uses the past to create something new. Additionally, it interacts well with the Trader mechanic.

The plane Terralon shattered long ago, isolating each realm (land type) in its own world. Isolation has strongly attuned each world's inhabitants with their lands, which have in turn evolved to reflect this focus of power. The isolation has recently been broken; the worlds have been united once again, if tenuously.


Sulrath is the Swamp world. It's ruled by Ven (turned-demon).


Lands are an often-overlooked "necessity" of **Magic**. I believe there's lots of fun to be had with lands. This is a look at how different colors could interact more with their lands.


I tried to execute the ideas in the best manner, rather than go out of my way for new wording; there's plenty of room within **Magic's** current bounds.


Major focus was to make the set play well both with itself and with other sets.


"Land Deficit" label made open-ended for future use (with things other than land).

I started with flavor- the Leyweave, source of magical power permeating a world; providing magic to the uninitiated, making spells an easily shared resource (Inspire), providing growing power (Draw upon). Side effects?


Mutations, consumption, subversive control of others. (Pawns) Keywords inspired subthemes. I then searched for intersecting design space while balancing needs. A couple cards don't directly tie into specific themes- like every set, some cards are purposely simple tweaks to flesh things out. The "whole" was more important than making every card truly unique.


"Parasite" could be bumped to uncommon for complexity; I judged it safe. It could also be tested at 2/1. "Flock" was tweaked with multiplayer in mind. "Confer" subtly nods at Lord of the Undead's flavor text. I tried Inspire with "can't block", but decided commons should all treat Inspire as a benefit. Lots of work, but lots of fun- I'm happy with the result.

Designer's Notes:


Kalach's Midst (Set 2 of 3) - A new primoridal plane/planet, rapidly changing and short in life-expectancy. Magic is still being discovered here. Pre-humanoid civilizations emerging. Artifacts barely invented.


Theme  

'Card Type' Wars


White - Enchantment  

Blue - Instant  

Black - Creature  

Red - Sorcery, 'weather', mana burn (manasinks deliberately scarce)  

Green - Land, Animalistic, Dinosaurs?


Featured Keywords:


Evolve [cost] - [properties] (must share a card type)  

(alternatively: Reshape, Reform, Rebirth) -can appear on any permanent


Holistic [cost] (must share a card type) -appears on all card types -RFG clause for safety


Auratide - [property]  

-can appear on any permanent


Alternate Play Costs  

-requires basic land control  

-RFG clause for safety  

-Lonely Treefolk plays polar opposite to Zombie Cutthroat!


Complicated Ally/enemy color bleed scheme separated per mechanic and card type -Small bleed - Stink Beetle (black) -Moderate bleed - Enchantress's Touch (white), Chameleons (all, evolution goes G-&gt;R-&gt;B-&gt;U-&gt;W) -Strong bleed - Kalachian Tempest


Gameplay Concerns  

-'Free'-ish plays rather plentiful  

-Hybrid card types may be confusing mechanically


Playtested with *Time Spiral* G/R and G/B Sealed decks, which I humbly encourage.

The central theme of my set is multiplayer, inspired by the advent of two-headed giant drafting. However, in order for the set to be successful, I knew it must be playable in all formats. Along with studying structures of small sets, I adapted Anthony Alongi’s multiplayer “animal” philosophies and applied this animal pie to the color pie to give green has a very plankton feel, while black obviously enjoys feeding off of others, etc. I also wanted to reward teammates who played colors that were allies in the pie.


I chose Focus as my main new ability, because I feel that it allows for some interesting choices due to the fact that it can be used as a determent to spells by requiring additional mana or as a boon through increasing a spells’ effect. Manapact is my secondary ability that would be sparser but pushes forward the multiplayer theme.


### And Then There Were Three


You’ve seen the Design Challenge. You’ve seen the applicants’ submissions. All that’s left is for the judges to make their comments and for us to narrow down to the Final Three. But we don’t do that until Part II tomorrow. That means that you all have one day to comment on what you think of the submissions and who you feel the Final Three are. Please join the thread and give us your opinion.


As for the judges, join us tomorrow as Aaron, Devin, Gleemax and myself give you our two cents and we eliminate the last two candidates before the final interviews.


See you then.
