*What's the coolest play you've pulled off in **Magic** 2012 Limited?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** I'm a pretty outspoken advocate of playing **Magic** to have fun, but I've got a dirty secret: When I'm drafting the latest set for one-on-one play, the gloves are off. Although I still look for awesome stuff to do and will sometimes try harder than I probably should to pull off some particular silly trick, for the most part I'm really just trying to win (and sometimes even succeeding!)

The point here is that my coolest play from ***Magic** 2012* Limited isn't something fun like [Thran Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Golem) + [Angelic Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Destiny) or [Crumbling Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Colossus) + [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling). It's not even something miserable yet hilarious like [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) + [Personal Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Personal+Sanctuary) or [Aegis Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aegis+Angel) + [Worldslayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldslayer) (ugh). It's a combo between a reasonably powerful common and an extremely powerful uncommon, and you will probably see it happen at some point in competitive M12 Draft.

So the way this went is that I [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control)led my opponent's [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) and then attacked with it the next turn. She ended up double-blocking it to kill it and one of the blockers. This is good. [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) is very powerful. But "I [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control)led something" is not a cool play. The cool part was when I cast [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) to get back the [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) to get back the [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), which was still the best creature available. Gimme that Rhino!

| Auramancer | Mind Control |

Yeah, that's right. [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) + [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control). Although I tend to think about [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) in terms of cute things like [Trollhide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trollhide) or [Goblin War Paint](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Paint), it works just as well on key cards like [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), [Ice Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage), [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web), and, yes, [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control).

No, it's not like [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) needs any help. And no, I wouldn't describe this maneuver as "fun," exactly. But cool? Well, I certainly thought so. My Rhino-stomped opponent might disagree...
