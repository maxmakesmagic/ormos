It all came down to this. After seventeen rounds of *Magic*, only two players remained: Amand Dosimont, playing Abzan Aggro, and Zan Syed, piloting Green/White Company. All in all, we had seven [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s, eight [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion)s, and six [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command)s in the finals, and the players who claimed that green is best color in Standard may have been proven right.



**The Players**



Zan Syed, hailing from Atlanta, Georgia, has had his first taste of Grand Prix success two months ago, when he made it to the Top 8 in Miami. He lost in the quarterfinals then, but he was determined to have another shot at glory and made the trip all the way to Paris enroute to next week's team Grand Prix in Florence.



Amand Dosimont was playing in his first Grand Prix Top 8. He had already defeated Pro Tour champion Antonio Del Moral León in the semifinals and was now looking to go the distance. The Grand Prix victory would also give him the lead in the race for the Belgian National Championship.



**The Decks**



Zan Syed had brought an aggressive green-white deck with [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and 24 creatures for three mana or less. His deck also included [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) for late-game presence, as well as the [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor)/[Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) duo that has been dominating the top tables all weekend.



Amand Dosimont was on Abzan Aggro, running a version that didn’t hold many surprises. He maxed out on [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), however, and these exile effects would potentially give him a good game against the ravenous, recurring Raptors.



**Game 1**



Dosimont had a relatively slow start without a 2-drop. However, his third and fourth turns were rather effective, as he added [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) to the board and got a two-for-one with [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command), dealing with both [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) and a face-down [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector).



Then the players progressed to the mid-game, with removal spells flying left and right. The game was all about board presence, and both players jockeyed for position.



Eventually, two [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s started to work on Syed's life total, and soon Syed had to make unfavorable blocks in order to stay alive. He found [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen), but that card is only really good when you have some board presence, and Syed had struggled to make relevant creatures stick around. A [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) that only hit a single [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) didn't help him much either.



On top of that, even though Abzan Aggro is called an aggro deck, it has so much staying power. Dosimont kept up the pressure with [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor), [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer), and [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion). He had plenty of mana to activate his 2-drops and he was making 2/2 flying Vampires turn after turn. Syed couldn't keep up, even with [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) on the battlefield, and eventually the air force that Dosimont assembled sealed the deal.

**Game 2**



Once again, Syed started with [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) and a morph, while Dosimont lacked a 2-drop. It looked like Dosimont had his work cut out for him, but in a surprising twist of events, he revealed that he had sideboarded into a control deck: He cast [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy) on [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) and then [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) to sweep the board.



But would it work against the card advantage that the megamorphs and [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) would eventually generate? Sure, the Abzan Aggro deck has enough staying power to capitalize on a board advantage, but it doesn't play well from behind. It can be hard for Abzan Aggro to beat Green/White Company in the long game, and Dosimont was running the risk that his sideboard plan would prolong the game to a point where he would discover that his deck could not play the control or value game as well as his opponent's.



Indeed, Dosimont had trouble pressuring his opponent with his situational, reactive cards, and it wasn't long before [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) came down on Syed's side of the table. A well-timed [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) plus [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest) from Syed eventually overwhelmed Dosimont.

**Game 3**



Syed took to the battlefield first, with [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor), and [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest), and that was exactly how Dosimont didn't want the game to go. [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is a good card, but it isn’t any good against [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) and [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest), after all. Syed then solidified his board position with [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) into [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Hidden Dragonslayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Dragonslayer). Was Zan going to beat Abzan?



Well, Dosimont fought back, and he had plenty of answers to stay alive. First [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) took out one of Syed's creatures. Then another [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) scored a two-for-one in response to [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command). And subsequently, [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) started recurring the removal spells. Dosimont had chosen his role while sideboarding, and he was playing it very defensively.



The game was grindy and immensely complicated. As it progressed, the board got clogged up. At one crucial juncture, Syed (at 6 life) had a monstrous [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), two [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor)s, [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), and [Hidden Dragonslayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Dragonslayer) in play, while Dosimont (at 22 life) commanded two 5/6 [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s and two 3/2 [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s.



Syed then drew [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen), and it looked like that might be the turning point. However, possibly suffering from exhaustion after two long days of Magic, he attacked with one [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) right after casting the enchantment. This gave Amand an opening, and he seized it: In his last chance to attack before [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) would spiral out of control, Dosimont went for the alpha strike.



Syed carefully lined up his blocks. [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) went in front of Den Protector. [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) blocked the other [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). And [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), a face-down manifest, and [Hidden Dragonslayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Dragonslayer) blocked [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). However, none of the Rhinos died that way, and Syed fell down to 2 life, regretting his attack with the [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) on the previous turn.



Although he was able to activate [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) again on the next turn, it was to no avail. The [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s crashed in again, and Syed had no blocks that could keep him alive for another turn.



Amand Dosimont 2 – Zan Syed 1



Abzan Aggro still has it: Supreme draws, early aggression, late-game staying power that puts some of the control decks to shame, and a plethora of sideboard options.



But it wasn't just a victory for Abzan Aggro. It wasn't just a victory for Amand Dosimont. It was a victory for Belgium—their second Grand Prix win all-time. Today, Belgium celebrates!
