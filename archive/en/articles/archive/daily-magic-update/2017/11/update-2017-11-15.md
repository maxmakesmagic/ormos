The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 15, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by the League of Dastardly Dooooooooooommmmm!!!


A Bit of News
=============


1. Expanding the Black Friday Promotion

Are you enjoying *Unstable* previews so far? I know we are. Quite a bit. So much, we felt a little bad for leaving it off the [Black Friday Treasure Chest Promotion](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/black-friday-treasure-chest-promotion-2017-11-07) we announced last week. *Iconic Masters*, too. So here's what we're going to do—we're expanding the promotion! Starting November 24 and while supplies last (check with your [local retailers](http://locator.wizards.com/) for more information), if you buy a box of *Ixalan*, *Unstable*, or *Iconic* *Masters*, you can get a Buy-a-Box Treasure Chest booster. Heck, if you buy any booster box back to and including *Kaladesh*, you can receive a Buy-a-Box Treasure Chest booster. It's not even limited to one per person!


And if you want to get me a gift for the holidays, that special [Search for Azcanta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta) sure is nice.


*[Note: In the APAC region, this promotion applies only to in-store purchases of* Ixalan *booster boxes.]*


Today's Previews
================


Every day I'll highlight the day's previews found elsewhere on the interwebs (read: not on DailyMTG).


1. [All Art, All the Time – An *Unstable* Token Preview](https://www.originalmagicart.store/blogs/oma-blog/all-art-all-the-time-unstable-token-preview) | Original Magic Art | Josh Krause

This is the one all the kids are going nuts for—foil, full-bleed, classic-art tokens. They're—well, yeah, they're kinda great.

One feature of the new *Un*- set is that the cards might be weird, but they're also very cube-able in some cases. This is one such case.

On the other hand, you probably don't want to put this one in your cube[nbsp] . . .[/nbsp] or do you?


BA BA BUUUUUMMMMMM


1. [Undivided Attention](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/abesargent-11152017-undivided-attention/) | Gathering Magic | Abe Sargent

I've heard Rosewater talk about how they've tried to make this work in black-border world before, and it just didn't quite get there. But it's not that far out there—is it?
