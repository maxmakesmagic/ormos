The 2011 United States National Championship is coming to Gen Con Indy on August 5-7!


Wizards of the Coast will provide a 4-day pass to Gen Con Indy for all players qualified to play in U.S. Nationals (except for players who earn on-site qualifications at the Last-Chance Qualifiers). An expanded National Qualifier system in the United States will offer more opportunities than ever before to punch your ticket to Indianapolis.


Players can earn invitations to U.S. Nationals by playing in National Qualifiers starting on April 16. "National Qualifier – Regional" tournaments will be held in 17 cities in the United States on that date and will offer eight invitations to Nationals. 


Canada's Regional National Qualifiers will also be taking place on April 16 in four cities, offering eight invitations to Canada Nationals (date and location of Canada Nationals to be announced).


On April 23-24 and April 30-May 1, select WPN Advanced-level stores in the United States and Canada will run "National Qualifier – WPN" tournaments. Each of these tournaments will offer one invitation to their respective country’s National Championship. Approximately 165 stores in the United States and approximately 45 stores in Canada will run National Qualifier tournaments.


The U.S. and Canada 2011 National Qualifier fact sheets have been posted on the [2011 National Qualifier information page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/events/nationalqualifiers).
