*Vintage Masters* Encore Draft December 4
-----------------------------------------


Beginning tomorrow, December 4, and running until next Wednesday, December 11, you can draft *Vintage Masters*. And just like the *Masters Edition IV* draft two weeks earlier, it's using the original Draft style: this is non-Phantom. When you draft these cards, they're added to your collection. Entry options include 25 Event Tickets, 250 Play Points, or 3 *Vintage Masters* boosters plus 4 Event Tickets.


For weeks listed in the [Alternative Play Calendar from Alli's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo/throne-eldraine-magic-online-edition-2019-09-18#altplay) as non-Phantom events, this League will begin at approximately 10 a.m. PT on the first day listed, which is always a Wednesday. These Leagues will be closed to new entries at 10 a.m. PT on the last day listed and ended no later than 2 p.m. that same day.

Pioneering a New Ban Cadence
----------------------------


For the new Pioneer format, R&D has announced that all changes to the banned list will happen on Mondays. Since we know that many Pioneer fans play on *Magic Online*, we wanted to make it clear how this will work with *Magic Online* league play.


Until the Pioneer format is placed on the normal ban cadence, Pioneer bans will take effect the day after the announcement, at noon Pacific time on Tuesdays.


If a card is banned, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses up until the ban takes effect. At noon PT on Tuesday, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned, players will be able to join the Pioneer league with decks containing those cards after the changes are made effective at noon PT on Tuesday.


For more information about Pioneer, check out [Blake's announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-pioneer-format-2019-10-21).

Alternative Play Calendar
-------------------------


For the *Throne of Eldraine* Alternative Play season, we're trying something new and different: a series of blasts from the past. And by that, we mean way in the past. For this season, we're introducing several non-Phantom events into the schedule, but all events listed below are Phantom unless stated otherwise:





| Events | Dates | Phantom or non-Phantom |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Vintage Masters* Encore Draft | December 4–11 | non-Phantom |
| *Vintage Cube* | December 11–TBD | Phantom |

Format Point Removal
--------------------


With the conclusion of the last round of Modern and Pauper Playoffs, those Format Points have been removed as event prizes. Similarly, the Vintage and Legacy Format Points will be removed after this coming weekend's Format Playoffs.


The full article detailing next year's Premier Play will be released later this week, including all of the 2020 changes. The new system is more streamlined and no longer includes Format Points, though this change does not reflect a reduced commitment to Premier Play on *Magic Online*. We're excited to share more in a few days.
