While it in many cases can be hard to decide what colours to play, sometimes the cards you open in the Sealed Deck just choose the colours for you. That was the case when Warren Marsh reviewed his card pool. "You have to find the biggest group of cards, you want imbalance in the card colours. The worst thing is three equal groups of colours and six lands of each," he explains.



"I think the format is really challenging as for getting the mana ration right. That means cutting good cards because your deck will suffer in consistency. Mana is so important. You can attack your opponent with Gray Ogres, but you have to be able to cast your spells first," Warren says. These are the cards in Warren's card pool:



**Land**  

1 Ancient Spring  

1 Geothermal Crevice  

1 Irrigation Ditch  

1 Sulfur Vent  


**Artifacts**

1 Troll-Horn Cameo  


**Gold**  

1 Armadillo Cloak  

1 Backlash  

1 Cinder Shade  

1 Coalition Victory  

2 Galina's Knight  

1 Shivan Zombie  

1 Sleeper's Robe  

1 Stalking Assassin  

1 Wings of Hope  


**White**  

3 Ardent Soldier  

1 Benalish Heralds  

1 Benalish Trapper  

1 Dismantling Blow  

1 Global Ruin  

1 Orim's Touch  

1 Rampant Elephant  

1 Ruham Djinn  

1 Shackles  

1 Strength of Unity  


**Blue**  

1 Exclude  

1 Metathran Transport  

1 Opt  

1 Phantasmal Terrain  

1 Prohibit  

1 Stormscape Apprentice

2 Vodalian Serpent  

1 Wash Out  

1 Worldly Counsel  


**Black**  

1 Cursed Flesh  

1 Dredge  

1 Exotic Curse  

1 Firescreamer  

1 Hate Weaver  

2 Hypnotic Cloud  

1 Mourning  

2 Nightscape Apprentice  

1 Nightscape Master  

1 Phyrexian Reaper  

1 Phyrexian Slayer  

1 Recover  

1 Trench Wurm  


**Red**  

2 Ancient Kavu  

1 Chaotic Strike  

1 Hooded Kavu  

1 Kavu Scout  

1 Lightning Dart  

1 Maniacal Rage  

2 Savage Offensive  

1 Scorching Lava  

1 Searing Rays  

1 Stun  

1 Tribal Flames  

1 Viashino Grappler  


**Green**  

1 Aggressive Urge  

1 Elfhame Sanctuary  

1 Llanowar Elite  

1 Saproling Infestation  

1 Thornscape Apprentice  

1 Wandering Stream  


If you want to try and make a deck out of this pool, you should not move on until you've done that.

"Green was not really an option. There weren't any cards in that colour. White was really good, but only as a splash colour. I had Master Decoy, some fat guys, flyers and so on. But I based my deck upon two broken cards, Stalking Assassin and Nightscape Master," Warren says. This is the deck he built:



4 Island  

6 Mountain  

7 Swamp  

1 Cinder Shade  

1 Shivan Zombie  

1 Stalking Assassin  

1 Exclude  

2 Vodalian Serpent  

1 Cursed Flesh  

1 Exotic Curse  

1 Firescreamer  

1 Hate Weaver  

1 Mourning  

1 Nightscape Master  

1 Phyrexian Reaper  

1 Phyrexian Slayer  

1 Recover  

1 Trench Wurm  

2 Ancient Kavu  

1 Hooded Kavu  

1 Kavu Scout  

1 Lightning Dart  

1 Scorching Lava  

1 Tribal Flames  


"You can have two equal colours and then splash a third, but the best is to have one heavy colours and then two others. I had my heaviest cards in red, lots of removal and lots of Hill Giants. Black had a really good set of creatures, and some nice removal tricks," Warren says.



So he opted not to be tempted by the two Master Decoys, and the Armadillo Cloak was also left in his sideboard so that he could take fully advantage of the Nightscape Master. The Master's two abilities are very strong; it can either bounce a creature back to its owner's hand or deal two damage to target creature. The Stalking Assassin is also very strong, although the activation cost is a tad expensive, the ability to tap a creature and then destroy a tapped creature can't be overlooked.



"I play two Vodalian Serpents, and that is maybe a little suspect. But I think lot of good decks will play islands, the majority anyway," Warren says. He reckons that his deck is good enough to make day two. "I have three byes so I will play four duels, and I think I will win three and lose one - if I play properly," Warren smiles.
