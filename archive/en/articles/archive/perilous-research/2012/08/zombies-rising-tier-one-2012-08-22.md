Welcome to the latest edition of Perilous Research. Last week, White-Blue Delver strategies posted impressive results. Newer strategies like Green-Blue-Black Zombie Pod and Infect were attempting to do some damage to Delver's reputation, but Delver remained on top by virtue of the sheer number of pilots. We revisit Standard this week and find that the format is significantly less homogenous than it was last week. Delver remains the deck with the most undefeated records, but Zombie variants are storming their way into the spotlight.

Delver decks are becoming more refined for the mirror match and many list are beginning to go back to one or two copies of [Gut Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gut+Shot). This has allowed players who like casting [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) to pick up Red-Green Aggro or Naya Pod and enjoy a certain degree of success again.

Here's a quick breakdown of the decks that went undefeated in last Saturday's Standard Constructed Daily Events:
