We've often shown you the process of how an artist's [sketch](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:) becomes final card art. In most cases, the final art ends up being pretty similar to the initial sketch, but in some cases, there's more of an evolutionary process.

Occasionally, an artist will submit multiple rough sketches of a subject, each with a different perspective or direction, and have the **Magic** creative team choose the direction they most want to see. Here are a few samples from *Betrayers of Kamigawa* in which the artist submitted multiple sketches for the card. Click the art to see what *Betrayers* card it became, and to see which direction was selected. 

### Card 1

[Yomiji, Who Bars the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yomiji%252C%2BWho%2BBars%2Bthe%2BWay)  
*Sketches by Hideaki Takamura*


### Card 2

[Kyoki, Sanity's Eclipse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kyoki%252C%2BSanity%2527s%2BEclipse)  
*Sketches by Paolo Parente*


### Card 3

[Genju of the Fens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Genju%2Bof%2Bthe%2BFens)  
*Sketches by Tsutomu Kawade*


Interestingly, the last one here took an entirely new direction before it went final. But it ended up way [cool](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/GenjuOfTheFens.jpg).
