It was the all-underdog finals that nobody could have predicted. Two of *Magic*'s under-represented countries shocked the world, and now stood on the cusp of greatness.


**Team Denmark**


A Seat: Martin Müller (Mardu Midrange)  



Last year was Captain Martin Müller's rookie year, but don't let his age or inexperience fool you. His debut performance was a 17th place finish at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, and he's put proof to that result by steering his team through to the finals. Against almost anyone else, the Danes would be considered underdogs, but here they have to be considered the favorites.


**Team Greece**


A Seat: Socrates Rozakeas (Mardu Midrange)  



"The Greeks don't care who they face." - Marios Angelopoulos


They were already a Cinderella story simply for making the Top 8. Even if they could get the better of Nam Sung Wook's Team South Korea, they would face either Team Slovak Republic or Team United States. A finals appearance seemed impossible. Showing the same grit that brought them to Sunday, they bested Owen Turtenwald and the Americans, and now stand just one match away from being World *Magic* Cup Champions. They came to the table brimming with energy and confidence.

The Games
=========



In the early turns it looked like the first game of the Whip-on-Whip match in the C Seat might not spiral out of control. Both Panagiotis Savvidis (with Marios Angelopoulos over his shoulder) and Simon Nielsen had turn-two [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). Nielsen dropped [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Savvidis matched it with [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant), who milled [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) to get a zombie. Nielsen swung in with the Rhino, happy to trade it away for Sidisi in combat. He quickly replaced it with [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). Savvidis took a turn to bring out the [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) and took a big hit in the air. Nielsen added a second [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc), but further attacks were stalled by the instant airforce created when Savvidis brought back the [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). They settled in for a long game.


Next door in the B Seat, Thomas Enevoldsen was on the back foot against Bill Chronopoulos. He'd managed to resolve an early [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver) and sacrificed it to animate the [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) it exiled. Chronopoulos went overhead with [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon). Enevoldsen's [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) was a turn slow, and [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws) dispatched the Knuckleblade to clear a path for [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) and [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic). Enevoldsen had no immediate answer, and as he struggled to find his footing, Chronopolous shut the door with a bestowed [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr).

**Chronopoulos 1 - Enevoldsen 0**



In the Mardu mirror, Martin Müller had the initiative. He and Socrates Rozakeas were trading off cards, but Müller's creatures were a turn faster, and he was taxing Rozakeas's life total. Rozakeas spent [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) to kill [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) during Müller's main phase, preventing his getting a free goblin token, but that let Müller cast [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) pre-combat and activate it to swing in. That was bad news, as Rozakeas didn't have removal ready for the big Planeswalker. He built up his board with [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) and [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), but the Sarkhan hits added up, and a [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) sent him to his sideboard.


**Müller 1 - Rozakeas 0**


Back in C, the board was getting very cluttered. Savvidis had a stocked graveyard and getting an advantage out of each Whip activation. He couldn't attack past the [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc)s on Nielsen's side, however. Nielsen further complicated things with a [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) of his own, but Savvidis found [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant) waiting on top of his deck. He was down to only 8 life, but could gain tons at the first sign of danger simply by committing to an attack.


Game 2 for Chronopoulos saw him stumble briefly on three lands with a hand full of reactive spells. Enevoldsen could hardly punish him with Blue-Black, and simply played out his lands. When he hit six, he tried Ashiok, but Chronopoulos spent [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm) and [Stubborn Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stubborn+Denial) to keep it off the board. Then he started casting [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)s.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/f_nielsen_savvidis.jpg)*The two teams both had to defeat multiple Goliath-sized countries to get to here. Now, only one team match remained.* 




It was bad news for Greece in the A seat, however, as Rozakeas's two-land opener had failed to find a third land, and he could only sit as Müller went [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) into [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster). He was down to 13 when his deck finally took pity on him and he summoned [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) bumped it off and [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) joined the party. A turn later it was over.



**Denmark 1 - Greece 0**


Enevoldsen had to spend his last two cards, a pair of [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall)s to clear out the Dragons. He drew a scryland and kept one on top. Chronopoulos went one better by ripping [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). It served up another [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) who hit play immediately. Enevoldsen revealed that he'd drawn [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), casting it and passing back. [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) from Chronopoulos drew out [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), leaving Enevoldsen helpless to stop a lethal [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws).


**Denmark 1 - Greece 1**


So it would be Savvidis vs Nielsen for all the marbles. While all that was going on, Nielsen had found a window to swing in with his Rocs, backed by a recently-milled [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros). Which led to him saying "So I gain...26, go to 50."


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/f_savvidis.jpg)*The Whip or Erebos match-ups can create some unruly battlefields. Savvidis, however, had the more unruly one.* 




All that did was draw things out further. He couldn't match the accumulated advantage of Savvidis and his Whip. Soon a second [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant) and a redundant [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) wiped his whole board, and gave Savvidis the game.



**Savvidis 1 - Nielsen 0**


Each team crowded around their designated champion. Nielsen took a mulligan for Game 2 and they were off. Savvidis kept a two-lander and had to sweat his third land on turn three, but [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) came to his rescue. Still, his draw was clunky and didn't let him get on the board. Nielsen meanwhile had gone Caryatid into Courser. He hit for 2 and tried [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc), but ran into [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke).


Savvidis found a scry-land and kept a good one on top. Nielsen played a second [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and then a [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) off the top of his deck. [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) milled a [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros). Savvidis offed one Courser with [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut), then untapped and played [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant). Nielsen answered with [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen).


Here, a moment of forgetfulness for Savvidis became a staggering blunder. With a second [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant) in his hand, he passed the turn, holding up [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and [Sultai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Charm). Nielsen could barely contain his excitement as he untapped. He [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)d. Savvidis [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)d. Then he turned all his creatures sideways and activated the [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) in his graveyard. [Sultai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Charm) could kill the Queen, but it was still lethal damage.


**Savvidis 1 - Nielsen 1**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/f_lastgame.jpg)*Teammates have gathered around Davvidis and Nielsen, the tournament to be decided by the result of their final game.* 




Again Nielsen had to mulligan, but he stayed on six. Savvidis had the textbook second-turn [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), third-turn [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), but missed the part where he would reveal a land that he desperately needed. There was still no land on turn four, and he [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)d, taking Nielsen's [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) and leaving behind three [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) and two [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). The discarded card also enabled Nielsen to Cut down the Courser, putting land further out of reach for Savvidis.



Nielsen ripped land number four and started casting Rhinos, each met by [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) from Savvidis, whose deck stubbornly refused to give him another land. By way of compromise, it gave him [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver). Nielsen needed a rip in the worst way, but found only lands. Ashiok's loyalty ticked higher and higher, with some tasty goodies being tucked away for later. Nielsen drew [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and stole [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke).


Ashiok was at nine loyalty, and Savvidis simply couldn't resist going ultimate. In the aftermath, there are some who said he acted precipitously. Nevertheless, he left Nielsen empty-handed. His shortness of mana was his only weakness.


Nielsen drew a nice one: [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).


Still tight on mana, Savvidis summoned a Courser and upped Ashiok.


When Nielsen peeked at his next draw his teammates faces betrayed that it had been another winner. He tapped seven and put down [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast).


Ashiok was exposed. Savvidis spent [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) on the Rhino to keep his Planeswalker, but things were going from bad to worse.


After Savvidis got no help on his turn, Nielsen again went to the top of his deck, and this time his teammates didn't bother holding back the cheers.


It was [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). You couldn't have scripted a better sequence of top-decks.


A turn later, Team Denmark became World *Magic* Cup Champions.
