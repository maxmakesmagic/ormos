*How do double-faced cards impact your draft when you're drafting Innistrad?*

 Double-faced cards have an interesting impact on drafting. At the Pro Tour, after each pack is opened, all the players at a draft table hold up their double-faced cards and get a chance to look around and see what's been opened. This can have a big impact on how players draft. 

 At the start of the second draft, Pro Tour Hall of Famer Raphael Levy glanced around the table at the double-faced cards that had been opened, and saw a bunch of the usual suspects: the [Tormented Pariah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Pariah)s and [Grizzled Outcasts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzled+Outcasts) that seem to populate almost every draft but rarely have that big of an impact. But there was one double-faced card that really stood out to Levy: the [Daybreak Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Ranger) that was opened directly to his right by Jun'ya Iyanaga.

 When Levy looked through his opening pack in his second draft, he found an [Avacynian Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Priest), a [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), a [Voiceless Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voiceless+Spirit), a [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard), and an unimpressive five-drop in almost every color. 

 That [Daybreak Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Ranger) in Iyanaga's pack forced Levy to examine his options in a very different light than he would normally. 

 Most of the time players will shy away from a card that requires you to build your entire deck around it (such as [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance)) until they've gotten a ways into the draft. If a player feels confident that the pieces necessary to make the deck work will come together, or if there isn't anything else of note in the pack, then [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) can be a very worthwhile pick. 

 Knowing that Iyanaga was (almost certainly) going to take the [Daybreak Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Ranger), Levy didn't want to take a green card, because then he would have to fight with Iyanaga over green. 

 But the [Daybreak Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Ranger) did more than keep Levy out of green; it also kept him out of white. When I talked to Levy after the draft, he explained to me that he figured that Iyanaga would go green-white. There weren't enough exciting Werewolves in the first set of packs, Levy explained, so it was very unlikely that Iyanaga would try to draft red-green Werewolves. That meant that the [Voiceless Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voiceless+Spirit) would also be a dangerous pick. 

 Consequently, the French Hall of Famer realized that he would be able to draft a blue-based mill-yourself deck without any interference from Iyanaga. That's why he took the [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), and ultimately put together a white-red-blue mill-yourself deck.
