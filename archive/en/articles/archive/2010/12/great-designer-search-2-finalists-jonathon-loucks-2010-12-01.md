Comments  

Energize is my shot at a simple light mechanic. Light has magical power, and embracing darkness means giving up that power and finding other means (morph). The light side, however, is strengthened by the immaterial.


Where energize is the energy aspect of light, illuminate is the information aspect. I boiled illuminate down to its simplest form. Without the light counter it's even more important to avoid exiling cards by other means - the bottom of the library is a flavorful alternative.


I recognize the beacon is my most complicated card. The idea is that there is a cycle of common beacons (minus a black one) in each set, and they're a tool to keep energize cards active. I templated it similarly to dig to not only keep similar flavor, but to add randomness to a type of mechanic that is usually repetitive (see: retrace).


Tapping is a simple mechanic that has been associated with light in the past, so I made it a sub-theme in white.


White wants to interact with morphs, but it's difficult to do so simply and without being too parasitic. I made sure my common morph-referencing cards were still useful without a morph on the table.


Living Reflection didn't make the cut. I like Dig and I wanted to give illuminate another chance, so something had to go. Depending on how the set evolves, I could see some form of Living Reflection at uncommon.
