Grand Prix Trials (GPTs) are smaller, regional **Magic**  Tournaments that award at least one 2-round bye to the appropriate individual-format Grand Prix. Players with a 2-round bye at a Grand Prix get a "leg up" in the event – they don't have to play in the first two rounds of the tournament and are considered to have won those rounds!
