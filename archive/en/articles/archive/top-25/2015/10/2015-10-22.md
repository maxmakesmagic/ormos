Owen Turtenwald is the new No. 1–ranked player in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings!


Hello everyone, and welcome to our weekly look inside the movers and shakers at the top of the *Magic* world. Turtenwald's fifth-place finish at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* in Milwaukee this past weekend propels him up four slots to what many see as his rightful place on top of the world. He vaults past Seth Manfield (up one place to No. 2), Paul Rietzl (down one at No. 3), and previous No. 1 Eric Froehlich (whose Day One exit sees him drop to No. 4). Next in our brand-new rundown is Brazil's Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, whose Top 8 run at the Pro Tour gives him one of the largest leaps we've ever seen here in the rankings table. He began the Pro Tour at No. 18, but closed it as the new No. 5 after a breathtaking *tenth* Pro Tour Top 8 appearance.


After a "business as usual" 11-5 finish, Sam Black remains at No. 6, while Mike Sigrist (No. 7) and Jacob Wilson (No. 8) both fell. Meanwhile, Spain had a terrific weekend. Although Javier Dominguez missed out on the Top 8 by barely 0.06% on tiebreaks, it was another rock-solid weekend for Spanish Pro Tour champion Antonio Del Moral León, who rockets up from No. 15 to No. 9. Ondřej Stráský rounds out the Top 10.


Further down the rankings, Alexander Hayne (up eight at No. 11) and Thiago Saporito (up three at No. 18) had notable upswings, with most of the rest shuffling downward to accommodate them. There were also four new entries in this very busy week for the rankings. Reid Duke is back, now at No. 19. Danish superstar Martin Müller is our new No. 22 after a tremendous Top 8 performance. England's World *Magic* Cup captain, Fabrizio Anteri, shrugged off a shaky start to claim a hatful of points in Milwaukee (entering at No. 23), and the Pro Tour victor himself, Kazuyuki Takimura of Japan, joins our Top 25 with his triumph still fresh in the memory.


With plenty of Grand Prix action coming up, we can expect a lot more movement, so join us again next week for all the news from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
