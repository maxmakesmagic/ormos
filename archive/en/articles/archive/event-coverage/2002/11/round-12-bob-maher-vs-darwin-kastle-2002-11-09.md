![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a455.jpg)PT Chicago 1999 champion Bob Maher has been on fire since his return to the Pro Tour a few months ago. He has a Grand Prix win and a Pro Tour top 4 under his belt so far this season, and is hot in pursuit of another Pro Tour top 8. Kastle has been a Pro Tour staple. In fact, he remains the only player who has played in all the PT's. He had a poor year and needed a top 32 finish in this tournament just to qualify for Chicago. Kastle started the weekend at 10-0 and is now guaranteed the top 32 he so much needed – the question is which of these players will be able to compete on Sunday. Maher is playing a [Sutured Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sutured+Ghoul) combo deck he and Neil Reeves got from the Dutch, while Kastle is running The Rock – one of four different decks brought to this tournament by Your Move Games. 

### Game 1

Kastle opened with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), seeing a bunch of land, [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond), [Sutured Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sutured+Ghoul), [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) and [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) in Maher's hand. The real choice came down to Therapy or Tutor, and Kastle elected to take [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor). Maher reciprocated by casting [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), but guessed wrong – he found no [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict)s in Kastle's hand. He did see a [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) however, which meant Kastle could go get that crucial card at will.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a454.jpg)Both players developed their mana base over the next few turns. Kastle summoned [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and a Llanowar Elf while Maher just laid down lands. Kastle hesitated for a few moments wondering if he should Tutor for anything. "Draw phases are good" he commented, dismissing the idea. Kastle attacked with [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), beginning to put pressure on Maher to try and go off soon.   
 Tutor finally came in handy when Maher summoned [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid). Kastle went to get [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). When Kastle cast the Edict, Maher responded to it by casting [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) to put [Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger) into his graveyard. This allowed him to activate [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid) and since the only basic land in his deck – a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) – was already in play, Maher just dumped his entire library into his graveyard. 

During his upkeep, Maher cast [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) with flashback targeting two copies of [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume). Maher cast it bringing [Sutured Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sutured+Ghoul) into play and removing a load of creatures from the game to make it 33/32. With [Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger) still in the graveyard, he was able to immediately attack for the win.

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a453.jpg)Kastle spent several minutes considering whether or not to keep his draw, consisting of Bird, [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder), and five lands. He finally chose to keep it and opened with [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). Maher's opening hand was much better. He pulled off its signature draw of land, [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond), [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid). When Kastle summoned a [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder), Maher tapped the Mox on his upkeep to [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) for [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate). After he drew that, Maher activated the Hermit, milling about half his library to get to the lone [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain).

Going down to nine life (after all the pain land damage), Maher [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d the [Sutured Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sutured+Ghoul) and made it 16/15. He removed [Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger) from the game as one of the creatures to feed the Ghoul nor did he lay the [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), so Kastle got one extra turn to try and deal with the giant monster. Kastle sacrificed [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder) and was fortunate enough to draw an Edict off its ability. Edict took out the Hermit, but a 16/15 creature problem still remained. Kastle was a turn behind from being able to Deed away the board – but even if he wasn't, Maher had a [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) in his graveyard. 

The Ghoul deck pulled off a perfect draw, leaving Maher at the same record as his opponent – 10-2. Each of them needs to win one of the next two matches in order to guarantee themselves a spot in the top 8.
