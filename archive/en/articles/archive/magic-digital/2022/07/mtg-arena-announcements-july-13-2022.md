July Qualifier Play-In This Saturday
====================================


The first [Qualifier Play-In event](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in) for the month of July is set for this Saturday, July 16, beginning at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC). This is your opportunity to prove your *Magic* prowess in next-level Premier Play competition and perhaps even claim an invitation to the July [Qualifier Weekend](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend) event—the [stepping stone to the Arena Championships](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-premier-play-2022-04-21).


Saturday's Qualifier Play-In format will be Best-of-One *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Phantom Sealed (in Phantom events, cards from the event are not added to your collection), so [check out the Event Schedule](#events) below for events you can play to sharpen your skills with the new set!


Dragons, Dragons, Dragons—Plus Rulebook Card Styles!
====================================================


We're celebrating the release of *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* by unleashing a flight of Dragons (or is it a flock? A covey of Dragons? No, that doesn't sound right) in a pair of new events!


Thursday, July 14: Dragon Brawl
-------------------------------


[Dragon Brawl kicks off tomorrow, July 14](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/earn-rulebook-card-styles-dragon-brawl-event-2022-07-06) at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC)! Revel in your draconic grandeur in this Historic Brawl with preconstructed decks featuring legendary Dragon commanders. There are ten rulebook card styles you can earn, including these!

Monday, July 18: Dragons & Dungeons
-----------------------------------


Delve into dungeons on the backs of Dragons in [the Dragons & Dungeons event July 18–28](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/dragons-dungeons-all-access-event-2022-07-06)! In this Historic Singleton All-Access event, Dragons with mana value 5+ are cheaper, and every second spell will venture you further into the dungeon.


This is an All-Access event, so you can use cards that aren't in your collection! Let your creativity run wild! As you plunder, you'll receive rulebook card styles of legendary creatures from *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate*, like these:
