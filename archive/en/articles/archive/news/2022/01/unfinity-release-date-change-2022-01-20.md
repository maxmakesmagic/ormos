Due to ongoing supply chain complications from challenges associated with COVID-19, the release of *Unfinity*, our fourth *Un-* set originally slated for April 1, 2022, will be delayed until the second half of 2022.


This delay is specific to *Unfinity*, and we'll have more information to share in the coming months. We greatly appreciate your understanding as we work toward our updated release timing and the wacky excitement *Unfinity* brings.


Until then, don't forget that *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* is nearly here! Be sure to tune in January 27 to [the official *Magic: The Gathering* YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ZGymAvfP97qJabgqUkz4A) or [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) to get your first look at everything Kamigawa has to offer ahead of the global release February 18.
