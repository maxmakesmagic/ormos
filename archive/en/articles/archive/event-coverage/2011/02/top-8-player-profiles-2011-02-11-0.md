**Vincent Lemoine**


**Age:** 32  
**Hometown:** Brussels, Belgium

 0-3 hours per week (maximum one draft)


**What Standard deck are you playing and why?**  

 Boros. It's good, fun, and normally beats Valakut. It has a lot of long game for an aggro deck.


**How did the addition of *Mirrodin Besieged* impact your Standard deck choice?**  
[Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) and especially [Bonehoard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonehoard) make it better.

 ~6


**What Standard deck are you playing and why?**  

 Green-White Quest, because I like angry birds.


**How did the addition of *Mirrodin Besieged* impact your Standard deck choice?**  

 Not much. [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) was nice for our deck since it lets you swing with equipped artifact guys without fearing [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade).


**Where do you play Friday Night **Magic**, or if you don't go to FNM anymore, where did you play?**  

 Basel

 Grixis Tezzeret. I felt it was the best Jace deck because Tez wins blue mirrors.
