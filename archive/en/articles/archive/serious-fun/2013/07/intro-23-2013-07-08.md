 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 





Since I started writing Casual Fun, the most-requested article topic has been Cube. It seems like everyone wants to know about Cube, read about Cube, or spread the word to the masses about the cult following that is Cubing. 

Cube: Defined
 A Cube is a set **Magic** cards, chosen by one person or a group of people. The cards are treated as their own **Magic** set. It is most often used to draft, but it can also be used to build sealed decks. While there are no hard and fast rules, most Cubes have only a single copy of any card and have equal numbers of each color. 

Cube: Varied
With so few restrictions involved in what goes in a Cube, the variations between Cubes are huge. A standard Cube is seen as a set of at least 360 cards, balanced evenly among all the colors, with cards in each color (and artifacts) that allow for evenly balanced draft decks among the colors or color pairs.

 Eric Klug has recently built a [Zombie Cube](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqftAlgRi5DMdEpZUU85LTFiWlRmbWJFeFdnUDhoVWc#gid=4). Matt Kranstuber has built a [Combo Cube](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/cube/24407-The-Combo-Cube.html). Many people will build a Cube using just the cards they own, so there will be wild imbalances between cards. 

Probably the most common variants are the Peasant and Pauper Cubes. A Peasant Cube includes only cards that have been printed at common or uncommon in a set, while Pauper Cubes use only cards that have been printed at common. Cube designers often use this as a way to limit the options available for the Cube, and as a way to keep the Cube less costly to put together.

Cube: Actualized
 I want to give everyone a more personal perspective, a better sense of the time and effort it takes to put together a Cube, but I have never built a Cube. Another player in my group, Josh Jenczyk, [@jjenczyk on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jjenczyk), has had a Cube for the last two years, so I asked him a few questions about his Cube and the efforts that went into putting it all together. For reference, Josh's Cube list can be found at [cubetutor.com](http://cubetutor.com/viewcube/92).
