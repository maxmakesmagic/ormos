### Card Vote #12

For this week’s card vs. card vote it’s the battle of the damage doublers. [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath), originally from *Tempest*, costs one less and also affects spells, but it also doubles damage from your opponent’s side of the table. *Onslaught*’s *Gratuitous Violence* is considerably safer to play but costs an extra mana and doesn’t affect your spells. Will [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath) get a second consecutive appearance in the core set, or is it time for [Gratuitous Violence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gratuitous+Violence) to make its core set debut? The choice is yours!
