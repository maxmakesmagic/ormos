We hope you enjoyed the [first](/en/articles/archive/art-close-quiz-1-2004-04-12) Close-Up Art Quiz. In fact, we hope you enjoyed how easy it was, because the vacation is over: today's quiz is a good bit harder. 

Take a look at these snippets of zoomed-in card art from the *Mirrodin* block. Can you identify the card to which each belongs? Try checking in at the [Magic Arcana boards thread](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=211646) to discuss your guesses!

If you need a resource for looking up some art, try the *[Mirrodin](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/mirrodin)* and *[Darksteel](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/darksteel)* product pages. They contain links to sortable spoiler lists chock full of "autocard" links. Or load up ***Magic** Online* and use its card search abilities to find art.

Tune in to Magic Arcana tomorrow for the answers!
