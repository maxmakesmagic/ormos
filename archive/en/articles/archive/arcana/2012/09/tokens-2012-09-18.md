As you may know, there are tokens in *Return to Ravnica*. But you might *not* know exactly what they look like. Let's fix that!



|  |  |

| Return to Ravnica Bird Token | Eyes in the Skies |

Bird tokens are always popular, right? And one of the cards that creates them is Eyes in the Skies, which gives us an excuse to show a card with populate. See what we're doing? Tokens... populate... it all makes sense!

| Return to Ravnica Knight Token | Selesnya Charm |

Knight tokens. Yay!



|  |  |

| Return to Ravnica Soldier Token | Precinct Captain |

Yes, the existence of populate means there are a lot of different token options. Soldiers are slightly smaller than Knights. They're also less vigilant.

| Return to Ravnica Assassin Token | Vraska the Unseen |

If I could take a moment to share something with you, I want you to know that the Assassin token is my favorite token in the set. That's just a great token.



|  |  |

| Return to Ravnica Dragon Token | Return to Ravnica Goblin Token |

Hmm. We haven't previewed a cards that make Dragon tokens or Goblin tokens. Weird!



|  |  |

| Return to Ravnica Centaur Token | Call of the Conclave |

Centaurs are traditionally 3/3 creatures. And this one is no exception! Look, it's hard to think of things to say about tokens, okay?



|  |  |

| Return to Ravnica Ooze Token | Slime Molding |

Not all tokens have preprinted powers and toughnesses. Because who knows how big your Ooze is going to be? The answer is in your heart!

![Return to Ravnica Rhino Token](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1062_9_9l4sibqwja.jpg)  
Whoops! It's another mysterious token. There are apparently Rhinos running around in Ravnica. You probably want to watch out for that.

| Return to Ravnica Saproling Token | Korozda Guildmage |

Saprolings were introduced to **Magic** back in [Fallen Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Empires) with cards like [Elvish Farmer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Farmer) and [Night Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Soil).

| Return to Ravnica Wurm Token | Worldspine Wurm |

BOOM! When Worldspine Wurm dies, it shatters into three "tiny" versions.



|  |  |

| Return to Ravnica Wurm Token | Grove of the Guardians |

Hey, here's something interesting! Did you notice that this is the only token with a guild watermark? Well, it is!
