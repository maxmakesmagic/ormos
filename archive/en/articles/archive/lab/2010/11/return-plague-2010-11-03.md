Hello again and welcome back to the Lab. If you're a Mirran, you've no doubt come in search of a cure for that mysteriously infecting oil that's spreading throughout your land. To which I must reply, with my best mad scientist laugh, TOO BAD! I'm all about the Phyrexian side today, indulging my newly rekindled love for all things poison. (Which means if you're a Phyrexian, come on in. There's refreshments by the operating table [specifically the one from [Instill Infection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instill+Infection)'s artwork].)
