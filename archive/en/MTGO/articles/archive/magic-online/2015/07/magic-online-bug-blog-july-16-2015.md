Known Issues List Updates
=========================


Earlier this week, we launched a [collection performance upgrade](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-july-14-2015#item4) with the Wednesday, July 15, *Magic Online* deployment. Several bugs were introduced with this build that we'll be rolling out a hotfix for later today at 9:00 p.m. Pacific (UTC-7).


We will notify players via Home Scene announcement and on the [@MagicOnline](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline) Twitter account when the fix is live. Once the hotfix has been deployed, players will need to log-out, then re-log for it to take effect. This fix should correct the following issues:


* Deckbuilding | If a player has no basic lands in their collection, they will not be able to use the "Add Basic Lands" functionality while deckbuilding.
* Trade | Users with Trade Binders larger than 50,000 cards cannot return cards to their Trade Binder during a trade.
* Trade | A crash occurs when navigating directly to the Trade Scene before the Home Scene loads.



---


**UPDATE 7/17/2015:**


We are working to resolve two issues that affect Constructed events and collection displays. We expect to deploy the fix as part of the 7/22 update to *Magic Online*.


If you are playing in a Constructed event, and you log on after a disconnection, all cards in that event’s deck will become unavailable for use in other events. This error will also cause a display issue in the Collection Scene that makes those cards also appear to vanish from your collection. These cards are not actually removed from your collection.


Until the issue is resolved, there is a workaround: First, finish the Constructed event and log off *Magic Online*. Log on again, then open that deck in the Collection Scene. Remove one card, then add it back to the deck. This will cause the cards to reappear in your collection.




---

The [Known Issues List](#list) has been updated to reflect these changes, so refer to that for the most up-to-date statuses on *Magic Online* known issues. If you want to see the history of fixed known issues, refer to the [archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-fixed-known-issues-archive).

**Newly Added Known Issues as of Thursday, July 16**

* Duel Scene | Trying to attach equipment to creatures that do not meet the equipment's requirement incorrectly depletes mana pool.
* Duel Scene | When you play a Ravnica shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before you decide whether to pay 2 life.


**Client**



* Collection | Searching for "Fuse" in your collection does not show any cards with the fuse mechanic.
* Trade | If you attempt to add cards to a binder so that the binder would have more than 50,000 cards, exactly enough cards will be added to reach 50,000 though an error message will display telling you to decrease the number of cards and try again.




---

**Known Issues Scheduled for Hotfixes Thursday, July 16** 


* Deckbuilding | If a player has no basic lands in their collection, they will not be able to use the "Add Basic Lands" functionality while deckbuilding.

**Known Issues With Scheduled Fixes for the Wednesday, July 22, *Magic Online* Client Update** 


**Client**

Note that this crash only occurs if you use both the Wish List and the “Add X to Trade” option in the same trade; using only one or the other will not crash *Magic Online*.
* Trade | In some scenarios, while trading, using the Search tool to import a deck causes Magic Online to crash.

Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
======================================



We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | [Restore Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance) will sometimes dim your hand and stall *Magic Online*. | If you encounter this issue, pressing F6 will continue the game. |
| Cardset | If a shield effect (examples include from a [Circle of Protection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection) or [Deflecting Palm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm)) is given to a creature during the declare blockers step, it will crash the game.  | Restarting the client will allow you to continue the game. |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature. | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters. |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| General | Players can experience memory leaks in some situations. | Restarting the client can temporarily resolve these issues. |
| Collection | Certain preconstructed decks do not create decklists upon opening them. | If you are experiencing this issue with a preconstructed deck, locate the product within the [Card Set Archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive) to download the decklist directly. |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error. | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Collection | Sorting by converted mana cost does not work correctly the first time it is attempted in a new deck or binder.  | Attempting to sort by converted mana cost a second time will fix the issue. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step. | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. |
| Sideboard Issues:* Duel Scene | Black game screen after sideboarding.
* Sideboard | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when Sideboarding.
 | These issues seem to be tied to the player's computer going to sleep during deckbuilding. Making it so that your computer does not go into hibernation may alleviate these issues if you're experiencing them. |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results. | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues. |
| Trade | If you open a booster pack that is in your active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade. | Logging out and then back in will correct this issue. |

**Server**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |

Known Issues List
=================



The following are a list of known issues on *Magic Online*. Our goal with the known issues list is to give players insight into what we're working on, as well as helping players avoid problematic bugs and performance issues.


Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of known issues, simply the ones that we feel players are most likely to encounter. These issues are also not sorted in any particular order, aside from their category. While the list below is not sorted by priority or projected fix date, bugs and performance issues listed as "scheduled" have a scheduled fix in the near future—this status is subject to change.
