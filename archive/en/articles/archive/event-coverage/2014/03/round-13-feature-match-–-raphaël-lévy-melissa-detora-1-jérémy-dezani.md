With scores of 10-2, both of these teams were one win, possibly two, away from clinching a Top 4 berth. The team-up of number one-ranked player Jérémy Dezani, Hall of Famer Raphaël 
Lévy, and Pro Tour *Gatecrash* Top 8 competitor Melissa DeTora was clearly the favorite here, however their opposition were no slouches either. Daniel Gräfensteiner had
 made it to the Top 8 of a Pro Tour in 2010, the same year his brother Tobias reached the finals of a Grand Prix, and more recently, in fact just last week, Christian Seibold made it 
to the Top 8 of Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*.


Interestingly, both teams had built the same basic set-up of decks. Raphaël Lévy and Daniel Gräfensteiner were piloting blue-green, even though Gräfensteiner's was somewhat more 
aggressive and based on heroic. Jérémy Dezani and Tobias Gräfensteiner both had red-white heroic decks, and Melissa DeTora and Christian Seibold both came equipped with blue-black. 
Nevertheless, the actual games here wouldn't feature any mirror matches, since the teams had put their corresponding decks at different positions.


Instead, to start things off, there was the pairing of Raphaël Lévy (UG) versus Tobias Gräfensteiner (RW).


This Gräfensteiner opened on [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite), then added, on consecutive turns, [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod),Akroan 
Skyguard, and [Eidolon of Countless Battles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Countless+Battles). Lévy could just shake his head in the face of such power.

For the second game, Gräfensteiner again opened strong with [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) and [Akroan Skyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard)but stumbled over mana 
issues. With his opponent stuck on two lands for most of the remainder of the game, Lévy was able to cast [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) and turn it 8/9 and that rode 
to victory boosted by [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary).


In the third, Lévy then had all the answers to Gräfensteiner's considerably slower draw: [Fated Intervention](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Intervention) for Kragma 
Butcher, [Fade into Antiquity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fade+into+Antiquity) for [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary), [Shredding Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shredding+Winds) for 
Flame-Wreathed Phoenix. While Gräfensteiner hit a string of lands, Lévy followed it up with [Snake of the Golden Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove) and boosted it 
with [Thassa's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary) to take the win.


**Raphaël Lévy 2-1 Tobias Gräfensteiner**


Then there was the pairing of Melissa DeTora (UB) versus Tobias Gräfensteiner (UG).


[Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior) plus [Stratus Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) plus [Time to Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+to+Feed), and Reverent 
Hunter plus another[Stratus Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) gave the first victory to this Gräfensteiner.


In the second game, however, DeTora's deck showed a surprising turn of speed with Nyxborn Eidlon,[Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy), Weight of the 
Underworld for her opponent's [Setessan Oathsworn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn). [Shrike Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrike+Harpy) and[Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer) added 
further pressure. Gräfensteiner may have been able to recover with the help of[Centaur Battlemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Battlemaster) and , but DeTora 
had [Asphyxiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate) before he could combine the two cards.

[Setessan Oathsworn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn), [Reverent Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter), [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr), [Stratus Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk), and three lands was 
Gräfensteiner's opening hand for the final game. Quite the good draw, and it did indeed carry him to victory.


**Melissa DeTora 1-2 Tobias Gräfensteiner**


And finally, Jérémy Dezani (RW) faced Christian Seibold (UB)


Dezani swarmed the board with [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader), [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite), [Traveling Philosopher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher), 
Chosen by Heliod, and [Nyxborn Shieldmate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Shieldmate) early, but Seibold had [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon) and Griptide
 to hold the fort. After the amazing start, Dezani appeared to be out of gas, whereas Seibold had only just begun.[Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer), 
Prescient Chimera, and [Aerie Worshippers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aerie+Worshippers) soon took over the game.

The second game played out very similar to the first. Dezani's initial rush brought Seibold to 4, then he stabilized with the help of [Bile Blight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) and 
the once again amazing [Shipwreck Singer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer). Dezani made a little headway on the board with [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught), though that was as far as 
he got. [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) made it interesting once more but was shortlived, and a couple of turns later Seibold felt the need to tap out with 
Shipwreck Singer to force Dezani's [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) to attack and die. If Dezani had had anything then, the game would have been wide open 
again. Alas, he didn't and Seibold's bigger creatures took over and took the game and match.


**(1) Jérémy Dezani 0-2 Christian Seibold**
