The March 11, 2016 Update
=========================

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 11, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Pious Evangel and Wayward Disciple](#preview).


Today's Must
============


1. [Eldrazi GP Weekend with Gerry Thompson—Bonus Episode!](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/eldrazi-gp-weekend-gerry-thompson-bonus-episode) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

Gerry Thompson is one of the best players in the world, fresh off a Top 8 in Modern with the deck everyone is talking about, *and* he happens to be a former member of R&D, so he has insight into the thought process that might lead to potential bannings—he's a heck of a guest for Masters of Modern. If Modern is your jam, this is a must-listen episode.


Preview Card, in Huge Flashing, Nerdist Lights
==============================================


1. [The World's Most Popular Card Game Just Took a Huge Risk...And It Paid Off](http://nerdist.com/the-worlds-most-popular-card-game-just-took-a-huge-riskand-it-paid-off/) | Nerdist | Kyle Hill

A Nerdist reporter embedded himself squarely in the action last weekend at [Grand Prix Detroit](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpdet16), and left with a few takeaways—and a preview card.


After That, Read, Watch or Listen to These
==========================================


1. [Archangel Avacyn and Thing in the Ice](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/archangel-avacyn-and-thing-in-the-ice/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

These two cards are getting a lot of attention after last weekend, so naturally Patrick and Mike are on the case, talking Standard shakeups and how these two baddies will change the way we play.


1. [Looking Beyond the Shadows](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/looking-beyond-the-shadows/) | ChannelFireball | Josh Silvestri

We've got another entry into the "previews haven't begun, so let's talk about the shell of Standard we do know" articles. This one covers both cards leaving and those that stay and improve.


1. [Inside Wizards of the Coast with Mike Turian: Smash Doubt, Embrace Your Intuition, and Play More *Magic*!](http://www.mtgprotutor.com/miketurian) | MTG Pro Tutor | Shaun Penrod

Mike Turian threatened to dunk my head in a toilet if I didn't include his episode. He's all, "Blake, there are great insights into working at Wizards of the Coast, some inside info I was able to share, and some cool learning moments from my Hall of Fame career. So do it or it's wedgies for a month." He then slapped me and said "I think listeners can learn a lot from this podcast. I'm really proud of it. And I want your lunch money."


1. [Pity Packs](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/thegirlfriendbracket-031116-the-girlfriend-bracket-50-pity-packs/) | The Girlfriend Bracket | Erin Campbell, Hallie Santo, Katie Neal, and Kriz Schultz

Ain't no party like a pity packs party, 'cause a pity packs party has packs.


The gang tackles the latest news, tournament action, and answers the listener question "Should my local game store offer women packs of *Magic* to entice them to come to events?" Hence the title.


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad*—Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obKTnux0AEE) | Seibenlore

Seiben breaks down the *Shadows over Innistrad* like it's the [Zapruder film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapruder_film). He concludes it was Jace, on the grassy knoll, with the cryptolith.

Say whhaaa??


You now know exactly as much about this as I do—that it seems like an awesome sneak peek.

You and everyone else, it seems. The [#GPDC hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPDC) is full of people declaring their teams, preparing for the weekend and, for some, [already being there](https://twitter.com/tnielsenart/status/708299562436452352). Check out some of these teams—from [Pat Cox's](https://twitter.com/wildestnacatl/status/708268525417328640) crew, to the [Saito-Watanabe-Calcano gang](https://twitter.com/hareruyaEnglish/status/708262050581979140), to the [Magic the Amatuering duo plus one](https://twitter.com/MtACast/status/708095507596492801), to [the two teams at the top of everyone's list](https://twitter.com/MishrasFotoshop/status/708034096983883778).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Rotation-proof Rakdos Eldrazi](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-constructed-league-2016-03-10)

It seems like we're starting to see every possible flavor of Eldrazi in Standard these days—blue, blue-red, Abzan, white-black, black, purple, orange-chartreuse, and everything in between. Today's deck comes to us from a 5-0 Standard League performance by SleepNoWinTheFire, who played what amounts to a pile of cheap disruption and removal followed by some of the heaviest hitters in Standard. [Chandra, Flamecaller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller)? Check. [Reality Smasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)? Check. [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet)? Check. [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers)? Check.


But it's also interesting to look at the mana base. Notice anything? The section title might have given you a hint.


No fetch lands.


That's right, this deck is actually 100% rotation-proof, featuring only cards from *Dragons of Tarkir* forward. I can't say if SleepNoWinTheFire was testing the deck on those merits, but either way, it looks like it passed with flying colors. Could this be one of the new faces of Standard next month?
