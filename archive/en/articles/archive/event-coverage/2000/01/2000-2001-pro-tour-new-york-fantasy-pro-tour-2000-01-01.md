It's time for the Fantasy Pro Tour for Pro Tour-New York 2000-2001!


There have been changes to the system from last season. This year, each owner will select eight-player team worth 100 Pro Tour Points, based on the Professional Standings that led to that event. The Standings used for Pro Tour New York 2000-2001 are [here](http://archive.wizards.com/sideboard/article.asp?x=protour/PTNY2000_Standings.asp).


People not listed on this standings cost no points. Players are free to select a team consisting of Bob Maher, Jr. (50 points), Kyle Rose (50 points), and six people with no Pro Points.


The person whose team wins the most money at the event will be the winner. The winning owner will receive a box of any Standard-legal expansion (or Invasion, even though it's not Standard-legal yet). The second-through-fourth place owners will split a box.


Entries will be accepted for Pro Tour-New York 2000-2001 from Wednesday, September 27 until Friday, September 29 at 8:00 am PST. Entries should include:


Owner's Full Name  

Owner's e-mail address  

Eight players, ranked one through eight.


Entries should be sent to [monty@wizards.com](mailto:monty@wizards.com)
