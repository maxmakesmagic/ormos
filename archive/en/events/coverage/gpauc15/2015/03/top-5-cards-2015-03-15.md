It's come time to wish the Fate Reforged limited environment goodbye in order to make way for Dragons of Tarkir. Here's a last look at some of the cards that defined GP Auckland.

Debilitating Injury
===================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Debilitating+Injury)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury)


Cheap removal defines a format and [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) helped define the Khans of Tarkir and Fate Reforged formats. The two-mana morph-killer helped aggro decks run over opponents quickly, yet also helped control decks slow the game down and stabilise. While not the greatest late-game draw, it's rarely a dead card. Yifan Wei had [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) in almost every deck he drafted on Day 2 (sometimes twice).

Goblin Heelcutter
=================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Heelcutter)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter)


He's no Ankle-Shanker, but sometimes cutting heels feels just as good. In a good light (and with a lot of makeup) [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter) looks kinda like a [Falter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falter) strapped to a Lightning Bolt. The mid-range and controlling decks looking to trade early were preyed upon by the dashing young Goblin, such as when John Brugman used one to run rings around Dylan Goldsmith's blockers. Certainly a card that will continue to bleed opponents in the upcoming Dragons of Tarkir limited environment.




---

Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury
==========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury)


A herald of things to come, [Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury) dashed and smashed John Brugman out of contention in the semi-finals. One factor that made Kolaghan so fearsome is the difficulty opponents have trying to answer him. There are so few cards that manage it and they are rarer still in a Limited environment. Will Dragonlord Kolaghan have the same impact in Dragons of Tarkir? Only fate knows.




---

Elite Scaleguard
================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elite+Scaleguard)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Scaleguard)


Everyone at the GP was abuzz with the power level of the white uncommon and he was certainly a favourite during Quick Questions. While the bolster is great value, the tap ability is what gives the [Elite Scaleguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Scaleguard) its true power. Fabian Dickmann's use of the Scaleguard to bolster a [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker) and clear a path to attack with it was one of the highlights of the GP Quarter-Finals.




---

Bellowing Saddlebrute
=====================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bellowing+Saddlebrute)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Saddlebrute)


Et tu, Saddelbrute? Without Raid this Orc Warrior will stab you in the back; but if he's in your deck, you're bound to be attacking anyway so that shouldn't be a problem. A four power, five toughness creature for four mana is perfect for when it's time to ride roughshod over your opponent. He's not pretty, but he gets the job done, and he certainly performed for Teruya Kakumae in the final rounds of GP Auckland.
