Well, after a few weeks of being distracted by previews, it's time to once again [go back](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/m-files-journey-nyx-part-1-wub-2014-05-09-0) and look at the Multiverse file for *Journey into Nyx*, and see just what we were thinking when we were making the set.

 One of the things that happens during developments through many, many playtests, is that we find what is working for our Limited decks and what isn't. In the case of [Sigiled Skink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigiled+Skink), we found the blue-red deck was having issues with where the creatures in the deck fell on the curve, and Dave moved Skink to help out.

 One of the hard parts about doing three-set blocks is that you do just end up with a lot of overlap, especially on something like Minotaurs, which are required to be of a specific size. We try to do at least one (if not more) vanilla of each color in each set, and that naturally means that somewhere there will be some strictly betters running around. Rather than try and avoid it at all costs, we do what we can do keep them from being offensive (like [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and [Knight of Cliffhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Cliffhaven) being in the same set), but otherwise understand that we will do them from time to time.

 When looking for new things for red to do (other than just burning faces), we talked with design and decided that red could have a version of card draw—it just needed to be a "use it or lose it" kind of thing. Luckily, the far-far **Magic** past was way ahead of us and provided us the basic template in [Elkin Bottle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elkin+Bottle). We first used this ability on [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster), but as we have put it on more and more things, we have found those to be pretty fun. Expect to see this in more sets in the future.

Development doesn't just focus on getting the tournament cards right—we also want to make sure that the casual cards are doing the right thing, and that the cards that are try to tell a story get the opportunity to do so. Whenever possible, we try to preserve these kinds of stories, especially when dealing with a block so full of tropes. Some, like Achilles, we ended up killing because the trope wasn't fun (A small creature that is invincible except for a very narrow range of things! What could be more fun?), but even when a card like this may not be the most enjoyable for everyone, the effort needed to get it to do its thing means that we can let the people who would enjoy it do get the opportunity.

One thing I have noticed over the last few years is the Elk proliferation going on in creative. I haven't yet figured out who exactly is the Elk fan, but I am glad he or she exists.

 This kind of card fits into the range of things that are cool if they are of the right power level, but that we try to be careful on, because they are not cool if they are too strong. We already had a lot of cards in the block that did similar effects, and we wanted this to support them, but if we were wrong about just how strong enchantments are, we didn't want a three-mana [Tidings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings). As it is, you are pretty hard pressed to run into the three-card limit, but I am glad it is there.

>  DH 5/24: Should you maybe pay life equal to its toughness or something? Or 3 life?  
>  DH 5/24: New design. Was "Whenever a creature you own dies, you may pay 2 life. If you do, return that card to your hand." It was breaking with [Shadowborn Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowborn+Demon).  
>  DH 5/30: 4/5 -> 5/4 since this is now poised for aggro deck, and want to separate from GB gods stats I just moved.

 Athreos went through a lot of changes. As a nod to the [ferryman Charon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_(mythology)), we first pictured him being able to be bribed by life to keep your creature alive, but the play pattern on that was not only not fun, but potentially dangerous. We didn't want creatures with powerful enters-the-battlefield or dies triggers to dominate in decks with Athreos and have your opponent have no say in the matter. We could've made that card, but it would've had to cost more mana, and what we wanted was something on the lower range of casting costs. By moving the life payment to your opponent so he or she could opt-out, we ended up with a card that requires a little more work to make work, but should be more fun on both sides of the table.

>  ID 3/11/13: I like the text on this one.  
>  DH 3/25: Rare poll winner.  
>  ID 4/8/13: Having to target the bolt before you reveal would be confusing for most players. You can kill illusions with it, or the opponent can fizzle the draw effect by removing the target.  
>  DH 4/9: Not ideal, but seems okay on a mythic rare, unless you have a suggested change?  
>  DH 4/9: 7/6 -> 6/5

[Keranos, God of Storms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos%2C+God+of+Storms) went through a lot of changes during development because of his peculiar trigger. We liked what it was doing, but between what we want it to do, and how the actual rules work, we had some problems. Being able to fizzle the trigger was problematic, and having to name something each turn before you knew what would happen was also pretty frustrating. While the current version isn't perfect, I believe we are happier with its rules peculiarities than the other versions. 




![Iroas, God of Victory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Iroas%2C+God+of+Victory)

Not sure we want this saving your own creatures from wrath effects on your turn. Could say during your turn, but that's even nuttier with wraths.  
>  KD 3/22: Could prevent all damage (or combat damage) that would be dealt to attacking creatures you control. That seems to do what you want without interacting with wraths.  
>  DH 3/25: Noted. Indestructible seems a lot cooler, and we have a lot of prevent damage in the set already. That may be a good change though.  
>  DH 4/9: Changed to damage prevention (well, can't be dealt damage since that sounds cooler, and seems to be what we do with protection). Solves Reckoner issues and awkward template, I hope.  
>  KD 9/18: Third ability changed after the slideshow to dodge Nylea. 
> 
>

 I kept the first comment in to provide some insight into just how long the process can take from start to end when creating sets. Iroas went through a lot of variations, and he was one of the hardest Gods to develop because of how strong [Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner) was in the real world when we were creating the card. We were concerned about that interaction, and ended up making Iroas a bit of a nonbo with the Reckoner, so giving it lifelink wouldn't possibly result in an infinite-life loop. The "must be blocked by two creatures" is another ability we are putting more and more into red, and was added after our internal slideshow (where we show the final versions of the cards to all of R&D) after people felt like Iroas felt too much like Nylea.

>  ID 3/14: Just plain lifegain feels really underwhelming on a Planeswalker, especially at 5 mana. Original Ajani got away with it because Planeswalkers were new. I don't think it would excite players today. FWIW I didn't dislike the first ability. "Creature or Aura card" works better for me than permanent, though. Can adjust the numbers to compensate.

Design creates the Planeswalkers, but most of their real work comes in development. Planeswalkers have a ton of knobs and are very hard to get right, so Ethan was being reasonable when he wanted to spend most of his time on other designs. Development spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get Ajani to feel right, considering how tied together the gods and enchantments are, so he didn't feel like his role was on the gods' side of the conflict.


 The last change was to put the counters only on your creatures, because we were worried about the Superfriends deck with both him and Elspeth packing a one-two [Plague Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Wind) Punch. Watching the [Pro Tour](/en/events/coverage/chapins-journey-takes-him-pro-tour-title), I saw more than a few games that would've ended differently if Ajani and Elspeth could've teamed up to try and kill a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion).

>  ID 5/7/13: It's strange that the 2 color decks need this more than the 3 color decks that can play 12 scry lands.  
>  DH 8/16: Question for the general population: Is this supposed to be "Pay 1 life, T: ..." instead?  
>  KD 8/20: Per Dave and Erik: Now pay life rather than deal damage, to match the land cycles we are most likely to reprint.  
>  ID 8/29/13: Glad we settled on pay life.

 We've spent [a lot of time](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/building-block-theros-edition-2014-04-18-0) talking about how [Mana Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Confluence) was put in the set to help out the mana for block, but here is the Multiverse record relating to that. 


 That's it for this week. The M Files will return soon (but not next week) with a look into *Conspiracy*. 


 Until next time,
