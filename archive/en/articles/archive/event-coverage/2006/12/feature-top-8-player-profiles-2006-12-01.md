![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds06/top8banner.jpg)Only something as huge as the Magic World Championships could handle a Top 8 with this many storylines. Friday's six rounds of Extended brought the individual Swiss to a close, giving us a Top 8 full of champions.


Let's start with the man who won the whole thing last year and this year's reigning Japanese national champion, Katsuhiro Mori. He'll be running a well-tested blue-white UrzaTron deck in defense of his title, hoping to become the first player to win individual world titles in consecutive years. Countrymen Ryo Ogura and Makahito Mihara give this Top 8 a distinctive Japanese feel, something that has come to be expected on the Pro Tour these days.


From there the story shifts to the man who has been at the top of the standings all week, Brazil's Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. The Brazilian National Champion and Player of the Year hopeful finished off three strong days to make his second Pro Tour Top 8 this season. A win in the individual final and a high place in the team competition could net Paulo the Player of the Year trophy, so he'll get no rest during Saturday's team competition.


Also angling for that award is Portugal's Tiago Chan, making his second Top 8 this season thanks to the Standard format. Joining him from Portugal is National Team member Paulo Carvalho, playing in his first Pro Tour event. Rounding out the Top 8 is another first-timer, Nick Lovett - who also happens to be a member of the Welsh National Team.

 2004 Player of the Year, 2005 Pro Tour-Atlanta champion


**Day One Record:** 5-0-1  
**What Standard deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

 MartyrTron blue-white because it was doing good against all the other decks.

 Draft whatever I opened, lean towards blue-red if possible


**Day Three Record:** 6-0  
**What Extended deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

 Blue-white-red Top/Balance, because I didn't like any deck and thought it looked good against aggro and combo. I didn't expect people to play too many slow control decks.

I played a lot of drafts on **Magic**  *Online*. Mark Herberholz, Rich Hoaen, and Jelger Wiegersma came to my place to test. I also tested with a bunch of other people and shared decklists with them. I built the Standard deck with Mark and since we didn't test Extended much, I just ran a list I got from Da Rosa.

**Day One Record:** 5-1  
**What Standard deck did you play and why did you play it?**  
[Lightning Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel). I watched a girl playing this deck in a side event at Kobe so I played it at Champs and I liked the deck.


**Day Two Record:** 5-1  
**What was your draft strategy?**  

 Avoid white. Pick a removal color (black or red) add either blue or green. That means red-green, red-blue, black-green, black-blue.


**Day Three Record:** 3-1-2  
**What Extended deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

 Boros with [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape). Frank Karsten advised me into it and I trust FRANK LE TANK.


**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare with?**  

 With the crew who went to Grand Prix-New Jersey and Yamagata. We were supposed to playtest on the trip but we just drafted a little too much. Afterwards we split into other isolated groups. Form there I just slept the whole days in Portugal and asked Frank Karsten and Quentin Martin for a tuned [Lightning Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) deck.

 I played red-green beats because I was hoping for an Urzatron / [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) metagame.


**Day Two Record:** 5-1  
**What was your draft strategy?**  

 Drafting the best possible decks. No strategy at all.

### Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa


  
**Age:** 19  
**Hometown:** Porto Alegre, Brazil


**Occupation:** Student


**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:**  8


**How many Worlds have you played in?** 3


**How did you qualify for 2006 Worlds?** National team


**Number of GP/PT Top 8s:** 1 GP / 1 PT


**Other Previous **Magic** accomplishments:** Second place at Pro Tour-Charleston


**Day One Record:** 6-0


**What Standard deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

 Boros, because we thought there would be a lot of Tron, and we didn't like the random factors of [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm). Boros can beat anything (except maybe [Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life)), it has its own game plan and it doesn't care about whatever the opponent is playing.


**Day Two Record:** 5-1  
**What was your draft strategy?**  

 Blue if possible, white only with blue.


**Day Three Record:** 2-2-2  
**What Extended deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

 Boros, because I needed to 2-3-1 and active decks are good in an unknown metagame.


**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare with?**  

 I tested with the other Brazilian and Latin players and with my ****Magic****-League friends (go Yankees!)


**Round-by-round results:**
