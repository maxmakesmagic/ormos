Silver Medals and Snap Judgments

Once again we have a new large set with Standard States right around the corner. *Shards of Alara* looks to be an awesome set, but it has big shoes to fill! As these five new shards join Standard, fan favorite *Time Spiral* (and the rest of its block, of course) will be leaving... So goodbye to [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel), [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir), [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation), and [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Goodbye also to the mighty [Skred](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred) and the rest of *Coldsnap*!

And a warm welcome to dozens of new cards featuring an innovative look at multicolored mana.

But which are the best cards? That remains to be seen over the next two years (and who knows how long after that in Extended and other formats), but we can make some good guesses based on comparisons with tournament staples past. So get ready for some snap judgments! 

For this one, I decided to break down the new set by mana cost and fire off what I think the best new card at each cost is going to be (ostensibly for Standard)... Never one for impulse control, I've peppered the lists with some runners-up and honorable mentions.

### One

![Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Relic+of+Progenitus)**Runner-up:** [Relic of Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus)

**Why it's interesting:** [Relic of Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus) is just better than some cards I've managed to win PTQs with... main deck! I once won two out of three Extended tournaments, including a Grand Prix Trial and a PTQ at a Grand Prix, with two [Phyrexian Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Furnace)s in my main deck; Patrick Sullivan and the old TOGIT guys have always joked that I "ruin playtesting" with my "random" main deck [Scrabbling Claws](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws) in green aggro decks. [Relic of Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus) has the boring half of [Phyrexian Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Furnace) / [Scrabbling Claws](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws) down, and offers a steep upgrade from the cantrip half... all the way up to [Tormod's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) range. Now of course this card is not going to be something that a graveyard deck will typically side in itself (as opposed to [Leyline of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) or [Tormod's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt), especially in Extended), but for a regular deck, this card seems like a justifiable main-deck inclusion due to the cantrip possibility, making it fast enough to be just perfect against Mannequin or Kelpie decks; then again, you can hold an [Oona's Grace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Grace) for post-Progenitus hijinks... &c. I think Kelpie strategies will be some of the strongest for the initial Standard, so [Relic of Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus) should walk into the format with customers lined up. Who knows how successful that deck would have been in Block if it had been adopted earlier?

**Runner-up:** [Akrasan Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akrasan+Squire)

**Why it's interesting:** [Akrasan Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akrasan+Squire) is a nice first-turn play, set up for a strike for 2 on the second. The beauty of this card is that because exalted is cumulative, with the right two-drop, you can actually be attacking for 3 with this creature. Moreover, late in the game, you can top-deck [Akrasan Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akrasan+Squire) and, provided you are setting up to attack only with one exalted creature per turn while locking down the Red Zone, *your freshly drawn one-drop will actually matter*. Amazing!

**And the winner is...** [Executioner's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Executioner%27s+Capsule)

![Executioner's Capsule](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Executioner%27s+Capsule)This card is just profoundly good. It is like a much better [Seal of Doom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Doom) (same cumulative mana cost, but in exchange for a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) that you are basically guaranteed to have based on the initial mana cost, you get the option for a down payment, which is quite compelling and aids you if you haven't hit your third), and [Seal of Doom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Doom) was a key card in the black-green deck of its day. 

[Executioner's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Executioner%27s+Capsule) has nice synergy with a number of commonly played cards in Extended, including format staples [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) and [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins)... It's basically infinite creature defense there. All-in-all, one of the best cards in the set. You can't beat the price!

**Honorable Mention...** [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)

If this were a base-Extended review, I would probably have picked [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) for best overall, but it's not, and the "Kird Kitty" is close to unplayable in Standard. In Extended you can expect [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) to be 2/2 on the first turn and 3/3 attacking on the second with the typical opening hand. Long story short, your Zoo deck is going to have even more offense than ever. The problem in Standard is that even though you don't actually have colored mana problems, your sources are not typically [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s and [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) but members of the [Graven Cairns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graven+Cairns) filter cycle, which are awesome... but they don't boost this creature.

### Two

![Courier's Capsule](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Courier%27s+Capsule)**Runner-up:** [Courier's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier%27s+Capsule)

**Why it's worth talking about:** [Courier's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier%27s+Capsule) is probably just much better than [Inspiration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiration). [Inspiration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiration) is a card that has never been a runaway hit at four mana the way [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) were, but it was always a key role-player and even a first-string card drawer when it was legal. [Courier's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier%27s+Capsule) is about the same—two cards for four mana, even if those two cards can't be aimed—but like [Executioner's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Executioner%27s+Capsule), [Courier's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier%27s+Capsule) gives you the option of the down payment. That means that if you are mana-screwed on two you can still draw two (and hopefully draw out of screw), whereas with [Inspiration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiration) you would actually need access to all four mana. Even though [Courier's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier%27s+Capsule) is an artifact (meaning that you have to play it at sorcery speed), you can still leave mana open to "fire" it at the end of the opponent's turn, so you can pass turn three with [Broken Ambitions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions) mana open. As an artifact, it is eligible for the usual recursion routes, many new options for which will be discussed in this here article!

**Runner-up:** [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary)

**Why it's worth talking about:** How does this creature match up with [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)? Drawing a random card off the top of your deck is less powerful than the [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) effect, but on balance, [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) doesn't force you to sacrifice it to draw the card; therefore you never have the Tribe Elder dilemma against control. Go ahead and crash every turn; you already got your money.

**Runner-up:** [Hindering Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hindering+Light)

**Why it's worth talking about:** At first blush I thought that this card was just an insane [Dismiss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismiss)... After all, what are you ever countering other than stuff that brains you or one of your men? Then I remembered something that Jon Finkel told me before [Pro Tour–Hollywood](/en/events/coverage/gindy-puts-name-lights) last year... [Remove Soul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul) was actually his favorite permission spell because *everything* he wanted to counter was a creature... [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter)s, [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Chameleon%2BColossus)s, [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mistbind%2BClique)s, &c.

On top of that, [Hindering Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hindering+Light) fails a subtle but unmistakable test: it seems kind of weak against combo decks. Permission is supposed to be good against combo decks! Strike and strike again. Will this card still be awesome? The answer is "probably." It will likely be outstanding when positioned against decks that target a player a lot (say discard spells), but it is not nearly the main-deck [Dismiss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismiss) in Standard that I originally thought it would be (now watch me go ahead and miss the next [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)...).

**Runner-up:** [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler)

**Why it's worth talking about:** This creature is more or less twice as good as [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), plus it's an artifact. [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler) seems like an insane disruptive card in the right matchups, and a fine clock in the abstract.

**Runner-up:** [Swerve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swerve)

**Why it's worth talking about:** When I first started playing **Magic**, [Deflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflection) was a chase rare. If you look up the old **Magic** *books,* there are long explanations by legends like George Baxter and Brian Weissman about how [Deflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflection) could generate this *card advantage.* In fact, [the first Pro Tour–winning deck](/en/articles/archive/lesson-symmetry-2005-04-07), a blue-white control build by Mike "Loco" Loconto, was permission-poor... but still managed to find room for [Deflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflection). 

Now today, [Deflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflection) might not make the cut; after all, it is pretty expensive! However also today we have a situation where a control deck has absolutely no need to conform to two colors like Loco did; the modern "white-blue control" deck has a *red* [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) and a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)[Hurricane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane) Elemental as well as a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)[Dismiss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismiss), numerous X![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) ground control cards, as well as some black point removal and recursion. Something like a [Swerve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swerve)—essentially [Deflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflection) at *half* the cost—can be splashed easily.

**And the winner is...** [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid)

![Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid)This one isn't even close. 

I just got done talking about how a "white-blue control" deck doesn't need to play with color discipline... but [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) is so good, certain control players might want to run a small stack of basic [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). This card allows you to ramp two straight to five on turn four, a kind of super-duper [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) straight into the ubiquitous [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter).

And control isn't even where you are supposed to play this guy! Just replace "[Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter)" with "[Cloudgoat Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger)" to check how impressive [Knight of the White Orchid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) can be in aggro.

**Honorable Mention:** [Etherium Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor)

I am not sure if this card will make the cut in Extended Affinity, but it sure seems to have potential. Affinity is the kind of deck that never actually seems short of mana... but at the same time it doesn't actually have so many lands in play. [Etherium Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor) kind of gives affinity for artifacts to your cards that *don't even have* affinity for artifacts! What happens when all your [Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star)s and [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion)s no longer cost *anything*? Second-turn [Salvage Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salvage+Titan), draw three cards?

[Etherium Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor) seems like a road stop restroom. Maybe you'll forget about it in five minutes. Then again, maybe you open the door... and there is something utterly disgusting on the other side. 

### Three

![Goblin Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Assault)**Runner-up:** [Goblin Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Assault)

**How it is going to kill you:** Remember [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)? You know, more or less the best Standard and Block card of the last six months? This card is just like that one, but instead of flying, your token gets haste. Is that better or worse? It's debatable. It might be a disadvantage that all your grubby little Goblins *have* to attack. What is *not* debatable is that because your guys are always in the Red Zone, you can't screw up and start blocking with your tokens like a scared little bunny. Oh, and no one can kill you with your own win condition, as you don't take a point a turn. So... yes, three is like *two* mana more than two, but on the other hand this card should still be a powerful and demoralizing way to win.

**Runner-up:** [Resounding Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resounding+Thunder)

**How it is going to kill you:** I think that this is a dangerous card. You can kind of sit until you have eight mana and kill a sit-there control deck and there is nothing they can do about it.... This is an essentially uncounterable cantrip nuke for 6. You can kill someone *just* with these. Plus, of course, you can defend yourself cheaply assuming you have something in your other 56 cards that would help you count to 20. Just an awesome card for short *and* long-term play. 

If you think of this another way.... You know those games where control takes over and ekes out the win from low life after accumulating an iron hand after weathering the early beatdown? Now the red deck can sit until it has enough mana and go for, say, the last 12. The "safe" line has moved.

**Runner-up:** [Hell's Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Thunder)

**How it is going to kill you:** Ka-blooey. That's how. This card is just perfect for many kinds of red decks, but in Standard I think the prize goes to the Tsuyoshi-style Shamans deck. We have all become used to the Demigod deck as the default red deck due to Tomoharu Saito, Michael Jacob, and many others taking all kinds of names with their [Ashenmoor Gouger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger)s, but Resident Genius and Hall of Famer Tsuyoshi Fujita invented a very different red deck with Intimidators and [Smokebraider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokebraider)s into [Rage Forger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+Forger)s (played to some nice finishes by Tsuyoshi Ikeda). [Hell's Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Thunder) can supplement [Thunderblust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderblust) as a hasty Elemental threat that strikes for a ton.

**Runner-up:** [Mayael the Anima](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayael+the+Anima)

**How it is going to kill you:** Put it this way... If you don't kill it, it's probably going to kill you. The ability is infinite, essentially uncounterable, whatever other kinds of positive adjectives you want to apply to it, free mana plus free cards. Mayael is like a one-card Rebel chain that actually gets awesome creatures instead of just creatures you play because they happen to fit into a Rebel chain.

**And the winner is...** [Bant Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm)

![Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bant+Charm)Three is the deepest mana cost in *Shards of Alara*. Look at how many cards *weren't* the best, and think of how many other playable *Charms* there are in the set (and I didn't mention any of the other four). Of all the three mana spells, [Bant Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm) is the best. 

Patrick Chapin explained it to me like this... For a *slightly* more difficult mana cost (and not even that much more difficult due to the availability of mana fixing lands), you have a card that is time and a half better than [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy)... which itself was a tournament staple in both Standard and Extended. [Bant Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm) doesn't destroy artifacts *quite* as well as [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy)... but regenerating an artifact is rare outside of [Welding Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar). But for the more common application of creature elimination, [Bant Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm) is infinitely better. You can't really [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) a [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) despite the fact that it doesn't regenerate, yet is both an artifact and a creature... but [Bant Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm) can shrug the big 11/11 off like it was an... I don't know... whatever awesome creature you spent all your mana on that inevitably died (you know the one).

Oh, and it counters spells, too. Can you imagine your beatdown deck that was going to want [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) anyway, and now it is stopping [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) or whatever? Full-on disgusting.

![Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Master+of+Etherium)**Honorable Mention:** [Master of Etherium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium)

This is basically a [Broodstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodstar) that tournament Spikes will be willing to play. Just another brutal must-kill threat for the Affinity deck to present. Like [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl), I don't see a bright future in Standard, but this should be near-staple in Extended if not an automatic four-of, blanking former [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) slots.

### Four

**Runner-up:** [Rafiq of the Many](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rafiq+of+the+Many)

**Why it's worth mentioning:** If you don't immediately kill Rafiq, get ready to take something like 10 on the next attack, maybe more depending on how much exalted the other guy has.

On the other hand: At only 3/3, Rafiq is small for a modern four drop, especially in green-white. This isn't a gigantic "crime" in and of itself, but he *is* in [Firespout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout), [Lash Out](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out), and [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) range.

**Runner-up:** [Stoic Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Angel)

**Why it's worth mentioning:** The last time an Angel on this model was released into Standard, it immediately took off as one of the best cards at States and for the rest of the year ([Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel)). [Stoic Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Angel) doesn't have exalted itself, but you can really see where the team was going on this one... The exalted is almost implied. Try racing this thing! (At least without exalted of your own.) You will either be outgunned two-to-one because the [Stoic Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Angel) player can attack with two guys per turn (with [Stoic Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Angel) not tapping to attack), or it can stack exalted and attack with the best exalted guy running multiple triggers, or some maddening, uncrackable, min/max hodgepodge.

**And the winner is...** [Punish Ignorance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punish+Ignorance)

![Punish Ignorance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Punish+Ignorance)Four mana permission spells are sadly playable. [Rewind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind) and even [Discombobulate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Discombobulate) were tournament role players, and we know from [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) that the modern best-of-breed is a four. But what about [Punish Ignorance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punish+Ignorance)? How good can it be on four?

Well for a single additional mana, we have both [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)*and* [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine) on a single card. If you've played with [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine), you know how the game can get to a position where you are just itching to counter because the damage has become relevant. From the opposite perspective, white-blue control decks are always trying to fit some way to gain life without actually investing a card. This seems as good an option as any... Look for it as a four-of in Block and something like a two-of (at least to start) in Standard.

### Five

![Covenant of Minds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Covenant+of+Minds)**Runner-up:** [Covenant of Minds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Minds)

**How does it compare?** [Tidings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings) was a tournament staple about two or three years ago... This card just seems much better, although I don't know how much it matters that there is only a single blue mana in the cost. 

**Runner-up:** [Scourglass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourglass)

**How does it compare?** I already went over this one [last week](/en/articles/archive/top-decks/well-thats-fair-2008-09-25)... It should be a very playable five.

**Runner-up:** [Tezzeret the Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Seeker)

**How does it compare?** Tezzeret's +1 ability is very reminiscent of [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) (imagine untapping two artifact lands, two Signets, &c.)... Now imagine untapping two [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith)s! One of these things is not like the others.

That isn't even the "good" ability. Unlike other planeswalkers, Tezzeret can immediately morph into something with out-of-the-gate board presence. For instance, instead of tapping out and ending up defenseless, you can go get a 4/4 flier. But what about this? You can pop [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) directly into play for no cost, and no waiting around! Did I mention "one of these things is not like the others"?

Oh and if you have four artifacts you can just kill them on the next turn or whatever. All's fair. Tezzeret didn't even win!

**And the winner is...** [Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion)

![Caldera Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Caldera+Hellion)One more mana than [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) (that is, the best card of its set), but you kill everyone instead of just one creature. Devour something and you get a 4/4 (or larger) threat that sticks around post-"[Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod)." I don't even know what to say, it is so obvious this card is amazing. Look for it in a five-color control with re-vamped mana. 

### Six

**Runner-up:** [Salvage Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salvage+Titan)

**Why it almost won:** This guy is really hard to stop long-term. I see a lot of possibilities with this card, especially with Capsules, Spheres, Stars, and so on... Just haven't got there yet. This card is obviously very strong and should inspire quire a bit of deck design the next few months.

**And the winner is...** [Broodmate Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon)

![Broodmate Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=BROODMATE+DRAGON)Eight power for six, both flying... Sounds like a deal. Now what deck does this go in?

### Seven

**Runner-up:** [Brilliant Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brilliant+Ultimatum)

**Why it makes the list:** So the question is, do you always win when you play this or always lose (or is it purely "win more")? It seems like you should have a good chance of winning... The only problem is that it is hard to test, because what kind of a deck wants to play this?

**Runner-up:** [Violent Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Ultimatum)

**Why it makes the list:**My friend Josh Ravitz likes this more than the other Ultimatums. "It's basically a [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire)" ... This one seems like a good card and reminds me of Ken Ho's homebrew from the Team Standard PTQs a few years back.

Just a thought...

**Runner-up:** [Sharuum the Hegemon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharuum+the+Hegemon)

**Why it makes the list:** As far as I'm concerned, this card sets the bar for mythic rares. In order to compete with a card like [Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae) as the control finisher, Sharuum had to do something special... She has Oona's body, flies over the defensive lines *and* draws two cards when she comes into play (or [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)s something, or sets up a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) for all nonland / nonartifact permanents)... In short, Sharuum may be the [Nucklavee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nucklavee) that sticks.

**And the winner is...** [Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum)

![Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cruel+Ultimatum)Speaking of [Nucklavee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nucklavee), can you think of a better incentive to get that guy back into deck lists than [Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) as an incremental Red sorcery? What can you say about this card? If you tacked all the abilities together it should cost something like ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)... So I guess this is where we should say thanks for the eleven mana.

When you cast this, under normal circumstances, if it sticks... You should win. The life gain is an additional buffer that I'm sure will be relevant in many games where you stick it out to seven mana. This is currently my pick for best Ultimatum.

So there you have my initial snap judgments on this exciting new set. It looks to be a great set of possibilities for States; I'm looking forward to building with these sundered shards, and I'm sure you are, too.
