Later this month, 24 of the best Magic players of our time will gather in Seattle for the 2015 World Championship. This weekend, four of them took a break from their preparations to compete in Grand Prix London. Naturally, we wanted to pick their brains with a variety of questions regarding Standard and the upcoming tournament.


Our second question: Which card did you expect to have the most impact here this weekend and what deck choices did you make because of it?

**2014 World Magic Cup champion Martin Müller:** "This is the week for Jace. When Origins came out [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) was obviously the most powerful card. The Pro Tour wasn't the right environment as too many people next-leveled it against him. This week it will be a good card. I'm running Blue-White Control with four Jace and four [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command) to return Jace."

**Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* champion Martin Dang:** "[Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). Played in Abzan, Green-White, Thopters, … I expect it to be the most played card. I have four [Unravel the Æther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther) in the sideboard against it."

**2010 Player of the Year Brad Nelson:** "[Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon). I'm playing it and hating it with [Arbor Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus). [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) is the best card in the format this weekend."

*Ondřej Stráský*


**Platinum pro Ondřej Stráský:** "I don't think there is any one card. I expected Abzan Control to be popular. Also expected the [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) deck to show up. Maybe [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). I'm playing it. I also have three copies of [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance), which is good against most of the [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) decks."
