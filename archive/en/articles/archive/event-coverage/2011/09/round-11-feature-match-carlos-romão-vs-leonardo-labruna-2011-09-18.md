Two rounds to go, and for both these players it's the last chance. At 7-3, a draw is no use to either of them, while two wins would put them into the tiebreak mix for the top 8. Romão is known around the


### Game One


Romão began with [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths) in his [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck, opposite [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) for Labruna, playing blue-black control. Labruna was probably going to say 'go' a lot in this one. He was happy to let Romão cast [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), and a followup [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Four turns, four lands, four 'go' from Labruna.


Don't worry, I'll let you know if anything exciting happens...


Romão cast [Visions of Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Beyond) unopposed. Both players laid some lands. Some more lands. At seven mana, Romão cast [Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind), which was met with [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Romão could pay, but chose not to. Enthralling stuff, right? Wait, here's a highlight reel: Labruna *not laying a land*.

*Leonardo Labruna*

Romão cast [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), this time paying for the [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) from Labruna. At that point the Ascension resolved, which was fine with Labruna, who was waiting to use [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) with Kicker to send it away. That send Romão into the tank, but eventually he took the [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) back to hand.


Labruna cast Inquistion of Kozilek, seeing two [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak),[Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil), Pyromancer Ascenison, and [Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) in Romão's hand. The [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) went away, and Labruna attacked with [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit). That's the great thing about the blue-black deck, the lands get you unless you do something about it, there's no need for big tap-out spells to get the job done.


Romão cast [Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind), targeting [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). That resolved, as did the [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). Labruna cast [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx), knowing that he would lose a counterspell war by two [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s to one. He didn't care, since he was trying to get [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) the following turn. He also knew Romão had [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) for that. Romão cast [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), but that too met [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) going the other way. No wonder there were no non-land permanents on the table.


Labruna tried again, this time with [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), and this resolved. Even an [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) wouldn't be the value now for Romão. He cast [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) with Kicker and then a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to kill the Titan, but still faced two 2/2 Zombies. He recast his [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), and passed. [Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise) from Labruna showed [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). He cast [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction), Romão responding with [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) to bounce/destroy a Zombie token. His [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil)s then went away forever.


On we went, in a game that was becoming really absorbing to a large crowd. Labruna tried again for his [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine), this time with three mana available to pay for the [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) which Romão cast anyway. With Labruna tapped out, Romão could pull the trigger. [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) with Kicker plus a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), both fed through the [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) machine, sent Labruna from twenty to zero in a single orgy of damage.


It had started out slowly, but it ended with fireworks.


Romão 1 - 0 Labruna

### Game Two


Let's try an experiment. I'll start with an update after five turns, how about that?


...


Hi, welcome back to turn five, where Labruna has just cast [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) successfully, and [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). That Jace has now just died to [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) from Romão, but the first five turns were all about [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s and [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)s. Honestly, you didn't miss much...


Romão landed [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), then Labruna cast [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb), quickly getting it to two counters. He cast yet another [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), his fourth of the game! With [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) sitting at two, that was an issue for Romão. [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) from Labruna named [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), which unsurprisingly Romão aimed [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) at. Then Labruna, having chosen not to pay, cast [Memoricide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide), with Romão responding by casting [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) from Labruna prevented that, leaving Labruna to name [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) for his [Memoricide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide). [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) blew up [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), and Labruna was now in complete control. Six mana meant [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), and this time Romão wasn't ready to deal with it. [Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) brought back [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), but it achieved nothing. Game three was just around the corner.


Romão 1 - 1 Labruna

*Ready for Game 3*

### Game Three


Labruna had to mulligan to six, keeping two [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), and [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb), plus two land, knowledge that Romão also had thanks to [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe). He cast [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), with Labruna replying as expected with [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb). [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) met [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) from Romão, Labruna blowing up [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb).


Then the phone rang.


To the sounds of the Imperial Death March from 'Star Wars', Romão nonchalantly pulled the phone from his pocket, pointed at it to indicate the music, and then pointed at himself. Leonardo Labruna, I am your own personal Death Star...


The deck-sifting went on for Romão, [Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) getting back [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). Labruna was stuck on four lands, not helped by that opening mulligan. [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) met [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). Romão of course had the [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) he'd just got back, but Labruna had a second [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) failed to resolve. Labruna made another [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb), and he was still fighting hard. For all the cards Romão had seen, he just couldn't get a [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) to stick.


[Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) from Labruna saw Romão respond with [Visions of Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Beyond), before revealing [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), Bust Lightning, [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) went away. Now we were back into draw-go mode, both players laying lands. Labruna found [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), cast it, and drew a card, knowing it would die to [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning). [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) found another Jace for Labruna, and this time it was left alone by Romão.


At end of the following turn, Romão attempted [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), which resolved, and then cleared out both [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb). Labruna cast [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction), which Romão was ready for with [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) met [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), which Labruna was happy to pay, still with six mana open. Romão cast [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), then [Visions of Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Beyond), into another [Visions of Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Beyond), which resolved again. Finally Labruna got to resolve his [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382187), seeing [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), [Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind), two land. Romão lost his [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and Labruna, with the way clear, cast [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan).


Could Romão craft an epic turn before Titan action got out of hand? [Call to Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) got [Visions of Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Beyond). [Visions of Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Beyond) left him five mana to play with. [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) was used on [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), the cards going to the bottom. He played a fresh [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), taking him back to five mana. [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) - [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension)...


Back to Labruna, who now had all his mana available, and it was a lot of mana. A lot. [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) plus two Zombies attacked, two more arriving on the scene. Romão was down to three as time was called on the round. This was the end right here. Eight blue mana, three red mana, a [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) with no counters, a handful of cards, an opponent with tons of mana open, and a dual World Champion one turn from elimination.


Showtime.


[Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). One counter on the Ascension. Cards sent to the bottom.  



Game over.


**Carlos Romão 1 - 2 Leonardo Labruna**
