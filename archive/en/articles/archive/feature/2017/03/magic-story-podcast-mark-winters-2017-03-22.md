This week, we're on episode six of six of the *Magic* Story Podcast, and we're joined by Mark Winters, *Magic* senior art director and the art director for *Aether Revolt*. He's here to talk about illustrating a world in revolt, art cues, details you might have missed, and share his pick for the most badass art in *Aether Revolt*.


The *Magic* Story Podcast goes behind the scenes with the people who make the worlds, create the characters, and infuse this game with imagination. Next week *Magic Story* returns with the kickoff of the *Amonkhet* story!
