**Question: What *Torment* common is your first draft pick?**

[Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher). The only time I wouldn't consider picking it is if I'm drafting white-black.  

-**Itaru Ishida**

[Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). It's probably the best card for a red-green deck-easily as good as [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), maybe better.  

-**Katsuhiro Mori**

Probably [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher). It's just plain good.
