Everything ran both smoothly and quickly at Grand Prix-Kyoto as 725 players matched off for eight rounds of Extended play. The field was wide open with lots of different archetypes making an appearance and no dominant deck type.





Undefeated after eight rounds, Kazuya Hirabayashi, Fusatoshi Tanaka and Yuki Murakami lead the way going into day two with 24 points each. Surprisingly, some of Magic's current stars like Fujida Ken'ichi, Komiya Tadayoshi and Alex Shvartsman didn't make second day. However some stars such as Toshiki Tsukamoto and Matsuo Goro have made second day joining recent Grand Prix groupie Ryan Fuller who will begin day two in 33rd.





Tournament Manager Chris Zantides had nothing but good things to say about Head Judge Takashi Aida's handling of the event, mentioning his professionalism and keen eye for Feature Matches.





Throughout the day the line to meet rk post and Brom was lengthy with many players eager to get their Morphlings, Unmasks, Hatreds and Mogg Fanatic signed while several players were excited at the opportunity to play former Rules Manager Tom Wylie who ironically had to call judge Ron Foster for a ruling!





One of the busiest areas in the room was the dealer area with table after table of cards surrounded by eager players looking for deals. Magic celebrity Mike Long was busy charming the Yen off players as he supplied them with Extended cards.





Everyone seemed very satisfied with the event and all are looking forward to an exciting day two tomorrow!
