| **WHAT IS PODCASTING?**
Podcasting is delivering audio content on demand so that it can be listened to at the user's convenience. The main benefit of podcasting is that listeners can sync content to their media player and take it with them to listen whenever they want to. Because podcasts are typically saved in MP3 format, they can also be listened to on nearly any computer. |

Randy Buehler previews Pro Tour-Los Angeles in the first installment. Randy takes a look at the red-hot Player of the Year race and talks with *Ravnica: City of Guilds* designer Aaron Forsythe about the impact the new set could have on the rotated Extended field. (If you're scared of technology, you can check out Brian David-Marshall's preview of Pro Tour-Los Angeles [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/pro-tour-los-angeles-preview-deck-doctors-without-borders-2005-10-19).)


Then on Friday and Saturday, Randy will be delivering new updates every few hours from the floor of Pro Tour-Los Angeles. He'll be talking with players, checking out the newest deck tech and bringing the Extended format into your speakers at home.


In addition to Randy's regular event coverage, we will bring you monthly podcast updates on the latest news from the world of **Magic**.
