*You're drafting New Phyrexia / Mirrodin Besieged / Scars of Mirrodin, and first pick, first pack you open [Volt Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge) and [Pith Driller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pith+Driller). Which do you take, and why?*

**Luis Scott-Vargas:** I would take [Pith Driller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pith+Driller). I was even saying this back in Paris during *Besieged*. I will go a pretty long way—especially in this format—to stay open. The bombs in this format are just ridiculous, and if I open [Volition Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins), [Carnifex Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnifex+Demon), [Sunblast Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblast+Angel), [Corrupted Conscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupted+Conscience), [Massacre Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Massacre+Wurm), or [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith)—what have you—I want to be able to pick that card and play it. So I want to stick as close as possible to one color with a light splash.

In Paris I 3-0ed a draft by staying mono-red in pack one while taking slightly less powerful cards and was rewarded by opening [Sunblast Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblast+Angel) in pack three. That's why I take [Pith Driller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pith+Driller)—it doesn't lock you into any color.
