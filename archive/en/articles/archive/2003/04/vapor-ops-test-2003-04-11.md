The Vapor Ops Test
==================



 Posted in [ARTICLES](/en/articles)
 on April 11, 2003 










A couple of weeks ago I wrote an [article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/rb62) about the process people have to go through in order to get a job in Wizards of the Coast R&D. The most interesting part of the process is the Vapor Ops test – seventy or so potential *Magic* cards for the prospective employees to think about. Around 83% of you said you were interested in hearing more about Vapor Ops so here’s what we’re going to do. This week I’m going to give you guys a portion of the test and I want you to email me your answers. I’ll read through your answers and then I’ll publish the most interesting submissions in a future column.


Here we go…

### Instructions


(These are the exact instructions I received in August ’99, by the way.)


Attached please find “Vapor Ops.” Vapor Ops is a collection of new cards and some repeats. We want to know your opinion on each card. Should it be published? Is it too weak or too strong? Is it good for the game? Don’t limit yourself to these questions. There are very few right and wrong answers. Your reason for your decision is as or more important than the decision itself. (Please don’t be concerned with card names.)


(The instructions I got also included “Please do not include your name on this document. You have been assigned a number to keep the test objective” but that isn’t really relevant to you guys.)


### The Cards


*White Uncommon*   
**New World Angel**  

4W  

Creature – Angel  

2/3  

Flying  

Whenever New World Angel is put into a graveyard, return it to play and sacrifice a permanent.  

Whenever New World Angel deals damage to a player, you may add WW to your mana pool.


*Blue Common*   
**Twiddle Bug**  

1U  

Creature - Insect  

1/1  

Flying  

Sacrifice Twiddle Bug: Tap or untap target permanent.



*Red Common*   
**Lazy Goblin**  

R

2/1  

Lazy Goblin can’t block.



*Green Rare*   
**Norwood Leprechaun**  

1GG  

Creature – Leprechaun  

2/4  

If Norwood Leprechaun could normally block a creature, it can’t block that creature.  

If Norwood Leprechaun would normally be unable to block a creature, it may block that creature.



*Gold Rare*   
**Life Cycle**  

2BG  

Enchantment  

1G: Put a wood counter on target creature.  

1B: Put a sludge counter on target creature.  

Whenever a creature is put into a graveyard, for each wood and sludge counter on it, put a 2/3 green and black Fungoid token into play. For each excess wood counter on that creature, put a 0/3 green Woodling token into play. For each excess sludge counter on the creature, put a 2/1 black Sludgling token into play.



*Land Uncommon*   
**Heart of Argoth**  

Legendary Land  

When Heart of Argoth comes into play, you may play an additional land.  

T: Add G to your mana pool.



Let the developing begin! Have fun!
