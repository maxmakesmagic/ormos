### Tamás Glied


**Hometown:** Budapest, Hungary  
**Occupation:** Professional *Magic* Player


**Where did you or are you going to school?**  

After I finished my high school I went to university, but I want to become a *Magic* pro, so now I'll give it a try for a year.


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**   

When I was around twelve (2007), I played with my classmate, and I went to a local store. I started taking *Magic* seriously after my first Nationals, which I made Top 8 when I was fifteen.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**   

We made Top 4 at the first World *Magic* Cup with team Hungary. Two GP Top 16. PT Top 75 and two times Top 50. I have two Top 8s at Nationals, too.


**Favorite format to play and why?**  

My favorite formats are any kind of Limited. The only one I dislike is Cube, because it's not a competitive format.


**What guild are you?**  

Simic.


**What is your biggest *Magic* weakness?**   

I hate losing. I just feel very desperate when I lose, so I try to avoid it. I have kinda limited time to make big progress with my career in *Magic*, then I have quite the pressure.


**What would winning the ***Magic Online*** Championship mean to you?**   

Everything. I mean my dream would come true.


**What format do you think you will do BEST at and why?**  
*Theros* Block Draft, I went 5–1 at PT *Born of the Gods*, and made Top 16 at GP Barcelona, so I'm prepared.


**What is your spirit animal?**  

Bear.

### Ondrej Strasky


**Hometown:** Kroclov, Czech Republic  
**Occupation:** Student


**Where did you or are you going to school?**  

I study in Ceske Budejovice, currently last year of high school.


**How big is your family?**  

I have divorced parents and two amazing older sisters.


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**   

I started playing seven years ago, when I entered our high school. In Czech Republic, *Magic* is really popular in many school, but usually the kids stop playing after couple of months and so did my classmates.


**When did you start playing on ***Magic Online***?**   

Three years ago. I was bored during Christmas break and was watching LSV's videos on [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing). It looked like a lot of fun, so one day I decided to make an account. I borrowed some tickets from my friend, built WW in Pauper (the cheapest deck), started winning, and now here I am.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**   

I was 10th at GP Amsterdam 2011. Been to PT twice. Top 8ed multiple PTQs (*Magic Online* and real life).


**How many hours a week do you think you spend on ***Magic Online***?**   

Around twenty.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**   
[Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze). Beautiful art and unique function. Also won me a lot of games in Legacy.


**What thought ran through your head as soon as you realized you were going to the *Magic Online* Championship?**   

That I finally accomplished something in this game. That I can show my parents and friends that it is just not some stupid hobby but actually something worth playing. Also I was extremely happy that I can go back to the Pro Tour even though that did not work out as I would have liked.


**How are you preparing for the ***Magic Online*** Championship? Who are you practicing with?**   

Basically by playing a lot. I start by testing Standard because I have a PTQ in Czech Republic two weeks before the Championship and I will save Cube testing for when it will be back online. I am practicing with my closest friends Petr Sochurek (16th in the last PT), Stanislav Cifka, and Lucas Blohon.


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**  

My good looks. :)


**What is your spirit animal?**  

Something really lazy and stupid—sloth, I guess?

### David Kaufmann


**Hometown:** Leipzig, Germany


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**   

In 1998. A very close friend, Daniel Regen, discovered the game during our last year at elementary school. He bought a *Portal: Second Age* two-player starter set and we were instantly hooked by just how the cards and the artworks looked. Soon we discovered that there were several thousand more cards and that a new set (*Urza's Saga*) just came out, and from there on a very hard addiction started. ;) (Although we took several breaks off the game.)


**Favorite draft format and why?**  

Cube, of course; I like drafting me some overpowered cards and play again with old Standard, Extended, and Legacy favorites, which just wouldn't cut it these days.


Next to Cube I rank the formats that remind me of my early days of *Magic*—*Mirage*, *Tempest* and Urza blocks. Being able to play with them always evokes some warm feeling of nostalgia in me.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**   
[Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest); it's just my favorite card in Cube. I would also wish to see it unbanned in Legacy again, the format is just totally different than what it used to be; nowadays Survival would seem rather fair compared to [Show & Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+%2F%2F+Tell) and some cards have been printed that are naturally good against Survival, like [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) and [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay).


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**   

The world. Championships!

### Vale Villanueva Perez


**Hometown:** Barcelona, Spain  
**Occupation:** Management and Services Personnel


**Who do you live with?**  

With Kira, my dog.


**How big is your family?**  

Big. I've got twenty-three cousins.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**   

Soccer, billiards.


**Favorite format to play and why?**  

Limited (Sealed or Draft).


**What thought ran through your head as soon as you realized you were going to the *Magic Online* Championship?**   

I thought I was very lucky because it's hard to qualify.


**What would winning the ***Magic Online*** Championship mean to you?**   

Winning the Championship is one of the most important things I can do with my life. :)


**What format do you think you will do BEST at and why?**  

I think Draft is my favorite format. Well, I prefer to play Limited more than Constructed.


**What format do you think you will do WORST at and why?**  

Legacy and Modern are my worst formats, but I'm practicing hard.

### Gabriel Rognasar


**Hometown:** Tampa, FL  
**Occupation:** Algebra Teacher


**Who do you live with?**  

Girlfriend, another roommate, a ferret, a snake, a chameleon, and a giant tortoise.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**   

Gaming in all its forms. Any activity that involves winning without having to leave your chair.


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**   

I was seven years old in 1994, right after *Fourth Edition* came out. My babysitter, who had moved to Texas a few months prior, sent me a starter set, which had two starter decks and a rulebook, with a note saying ,"I found this game, I really think you would like it!" I had no real idea how to play, so my friends and I basically made up the rules, and I have been playing ever since.


**When did you start playing on ***Magic Online***?**   

I have been playing *Magic Online* since the original beta. I remember walking home from high school and being so excited to be able to get home and play *Magic* from my house, because before that, I had to rely on my parents to drive me to tournaments!


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**   

Nothing terribly impressive. I have won two PTQs (made Day Two at Pro Tour Paris with a sweet [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede) deck I made, and horrifically scrubbed out of Pro Tour San Diego with a [Notion Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notion+Thief)/[Whispering Madness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Madness) deck that couldn't beat decks with [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling), which was all of them). I am cursed with the compulsion to only play decks I make myself. Well, other than the one I won the MOCS with...


**Favorite draft format and why?**  

Definitely Cube draft. It's like Legacy, but you have to cobble a deck together out of gum and shoelaces.


**What thought ran through your head as soon as you realized you were going to the ***Magic Online*** Championship?**   

I yelled a lot, out loud. Which I never do. Scared the hell out of my family! I have actually never been so excited in my life. Nearly two decades of playing finally paid off


**What would winning the ***Magic Online*** Championship mean to you?**   

It would mean that my opponents were horribly unprepared!


**How are you preparing for the ***Magic Online*** Championship? Who are you practicing with?**   

I am going to be incredibly unprepared. I am trying to find time to do at least a draft a day, but unfortunately, being a first-year teacher takes up a ridiculous amount of my time. I'm not really practicing with anyone. Ari C is helping me prepare but he's as busy as I am.


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**  

My current plan is to live on a self-sustaining farm/commune situation in about four years with my best friend. We just bought the land for it!


**What is your spirit animal?**  

Definitely ferret. Does dumb things for the fun of it, with absolutely no regard for its own safety
