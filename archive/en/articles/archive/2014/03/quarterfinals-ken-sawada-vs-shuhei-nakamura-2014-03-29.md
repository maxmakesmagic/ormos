**Game One**




 Nakamura was on the play and promptly removed [Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain) with [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), and forced Sawada to discard [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis) with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize).




 However, he was on the receiving end of a blistering assault, fueled by [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) as well as [Lyev Skyknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyev+Skyknight) and [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault).




 When Sawada used [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) to kill Nakamura's [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), it felt like he was truly behind. Nakamura did have [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) to deal with Brimaz but he was already down to a precarious 5 life.




 Lyev Skynight and [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) mopped things up and both players reached for their sideboards.
