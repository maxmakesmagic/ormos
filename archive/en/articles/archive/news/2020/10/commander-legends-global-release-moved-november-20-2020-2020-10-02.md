Due to production challenges related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have made the decision to push back the full global launch of *Commander Legends* to November 20, 2020.


This will include all *Commander Legends* products: Draft Boosters, Collector Boosters, and Commander Decks. Prereleases will occur starting November 13, 2020 (Prerelease promos will have the previous date printed on them. In regions where in-store play is paused, organizers may host at-home and remote Prereleases only). On *Magic Online*, product and events will be available Thursday, November 19, 2020.


Previews for the highly anticipated set will now begin October 26, 2020.


We know players are excited for this release, and for that reason we've decided to move the launch back to provide all players a complete *Magic* experience at the same time. We continue to adapt to a world transformed, and we appreciate your continued patience as we manage these new challenges. We plan to deliver our products as soon as it is both feasible and safe, and we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and partners.
