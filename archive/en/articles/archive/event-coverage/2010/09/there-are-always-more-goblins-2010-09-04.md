Former World champion Julien Nuijten and Pro Tour mainstay Robert van Medevoort could be seen today slinging some rather unusual spells, with [Goblin Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain) and even [Boartusk Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boartusk+Liege) pumping up [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide)s and [Warren Instigator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Instigator)s. They were thought to be (and officially proclaimed) dead with the departure of [Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onslaught) block, but Goblins always pop up again and again. So how does one come up with the idea to play Goblins?


"The general idea was very different," said Bram Snepvangers who created the deck. "It actually started out as a red-green deck with all of the red creatures with double strike and various pump spells like [Colossal Might](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossal+Might)."


"This old version of the deck was really, really fast, with possible turn-three kills," Bram explained. "But it was rather inconsistent. For example, it was very bad against [Punishing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) which we knew would be everywhere, and often even against one single [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Pumping your creature is not much fun when it's shot down in response."

![Warren Instigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Warren+Instigator)

"Two of the double strikers were Goblins anyway, [Hearthfire Hobgoblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearthfire+Hobgoblin) and [Warren Instigator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Instigator)," he pointed out, "so the deck gradually morphed into a real tribal Goblin deck. Ironically, some of the Goblins didn't make the cut for the final deck, like [Hearthfire Hobgoblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearthfire+Hobgoblin)."

"The deck is still pretty fast, and has a good game against the different combo decks too," Bram said. "[Earwig Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earwig+Squad) is especially good. Take [Ad Nauseam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) for example. One hit by [Earwig Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earwig+Squad) and they lose all their winning options. [Living End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) decks likewise lose all of their namesake cards, and [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) loses three copies of [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle)."



![Earwig Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Earwig+Squad)

"But the match-up against [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) is actually pretty bad," Bram added, and apparently encountered some awful memories. "That's what I mostly played against. That's why I'm standing here as opposed to sitting over there with the others," he said, indicating the day two play area."I expected more [Ad Nauseam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) and less [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). That deck is just terrible—it cannot possibly beat [Ad Nauseam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam)."


The quirkiest card in the list by far is the one [Fodder Launch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fodder+Launch) in the sideboard. What's up with that?



![Fodder Launch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fodder+Launch)

"Well, it kills a five-toughness creature and deals five damage," he said, "which is good against [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) and the likes. But mostly you bring it in against decks with Angels."


About the sideboard in general he had the following to say: "I don't like [Thought Hemorrhage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Hemorrhage) because it really interferes with [Thorn of Amethyst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorn+of+Amethyst), and I don't like [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) / [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) because it doesn't do that much against the combo decks out there. [Living End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) has way too many cascade cards, and [Ad Nauseam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) has [Mystical Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings) to replace their combo pieces. I'd just rather hit them with [Earwig Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earwig+Squad). [Thorn of Amethyst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorn+of+Amethyst), however, is a very strong card. It is best against cascade because it makes [Living End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) cost two more."



![Thorn of Amethyst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thorn+of+Amethyst)

The moral of the story is: you can take the Goblins out of Extended ... but there are always just more Goblins.
