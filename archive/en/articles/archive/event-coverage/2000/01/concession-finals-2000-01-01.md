During the Finals of the Canadian National championship, Elijah Pollock conceded to Terry Tsang. Pollock has a medical condition, which actually caused him to be late for the Quarterfinals earlier in the day. He still competed, and earned a spot on the Canadian National team. Once he reached the Finals, he felt that he was in no condition to play another match. Pollock talked to head judge Mike Donais to confirm that what he was doing was legal. Since this was the Finals, the result of this match would not effect anyone else in the tournament. Both Terry Tsang and Elijah Pollock were already guaranteed a spot on the Canadian National Team.


Jeff Donais, Worldwide Magic Tournament Manager, was called, and said, "I am fine with a concession at a National Championship as long as there was no bribe involved, which it appears there was not. At a Pro Tour, with the pro points and media coverage involved, I would not be comfortable with a concession in the Top 8. The concession also didn't affect anyone else in the tournament, since it was the final and decisive match."
