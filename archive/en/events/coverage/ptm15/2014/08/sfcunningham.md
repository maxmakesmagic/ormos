 As they sat down to their match, Pierre Mondon offered Jackson Cunningham his hand. They shook, and Mondon smiled broadly. "Best of luck, man, whatever happens."




**The Decks**




 It was a very similar match-up to the one Cunningham had faced against Yuuki Ichikawa in the quarters. Cunningham thought his White-Green Aggro was an underdog overall, but had managed to take down Ichikawa's Jund Planeswalkers in three games. Mondon's list differs by having more main-deck removal and [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) over some of the Planeswalkers.






*Jackson Cunningham and Pierre Mondon intend to make the most of their first Pro Tour Top 8s.*
