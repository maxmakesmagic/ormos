**Job Title and Duties:** **Magic** Development Intern. Right now, I playtest all our upcoming sets—Limited and Constructed—like crazy. I’m also working on a couple as-yet-unannounced standalone products. 

**Age:** 23

**Education:** BA, Political Science, Phi Beta Kappa: Rhodes College—I might be the only human being whose mascot has been a "Lynx" from first grade on through college. 

**Began Working at Wizards:** Last Tuesday!

**Previous job:** Policy Analyst, The Centre for Independent Journalism, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

**How you got your job here:**

So I spent my last year as a Luce Scholar, courtesy of a nationwide competition sponsored by the Henry Luce Foundation. This was totally totally totally ridiculously awesome for a large number of reasons, many of which involved food, but it also meant that for the first time ever in my life I wasn’t on a big massive intimidating expansive artificial "track." So while I was applying for law schools, grad schools, creative writing schools, etc., I said to myself, "This might be the only point where I can just try to do whatever I want without any cataclysmic consequences." It was insanely liberating, in a way. So I shot an email out to Aaron Forsythe saying, "Hey. You read my stuff right? Can I, um. Work at Wizards?" It’s possible I \*might\* have been more eloquent. But he was familiar with my work, asked to see a resume, and a few short months later I had landed the job. Yaus!

### **Magic** playing accomplishments:

T8 [Pro Tour Honolulu](/en/events/coverage/mitamura-finds-gold-paradise), T4 Malaysia Nationals, T2 [GP St Louis](/en/events/coverage/eastern-cold-front-snaps-st-louis-heatwave), 3 GP Top 16s, 60-odd lifetime Pro Points. Designed "Elves!," Gifts Tron, Rock and Nail, and a number of other competitive decks.

### Favorite part of your job:

"You really need to spend more time playing **Magic**" – Mark Globus.

### Least favorite part of your job:

Playtest stickers. :-(

### Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:

Here? Um. A certain Banned/Restricted list meeting whose results are presently classified. In general? Selangor State Right to Information Law, the [Memphis](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/16) Pyramid Arena redevelopment, the [Chatter of the Squirrel](http://www.starcitygames.com/pages/articlefinder.php?keyword=Zac+Hill) series.

### Other games you currently enjoy playing:

Dominion, Race to the Galaxy, TurboHearts.

### Favorite **Magic** card(s):

### In your spare time:

Acting, short-fiction-and-poetry-writing, editing, trivia teaming, karaoke-ing, ‘coaching’ college Mock Trial, food snobbery, public speaking, policy junkie-ing, social butterflying, concert-attending. Seriously before I left for Malaysia I didn’t really MTG that much. That, um. Changed.

### Something the readers don't know about you:

 I basically bared all in my column, so. Secrets aren’t my forte. I was in line to play Dennis the Menace in that movie they released infinite years ago, but I lost my two front teeth and was thus out of contention for the final four or whatever. It might make people chuckle that for a solid five years of my life I was \*convinced\* that my purpose in life was to be a Presbyterian minister. Yet again, that, um. Changed.
