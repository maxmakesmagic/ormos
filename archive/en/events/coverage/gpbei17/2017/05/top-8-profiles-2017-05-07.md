**Hometown:** China  
**Age:** 33  
**Occupation:** Office Assistant  
**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** Friday Night Magic Top 8


**Day 1 Summary:**  

9 – 0 (2 Byes). I had a Black-Red deck with [Archfiend of Ifnir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archfiend+of+Ifnir) and [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer).


**Day 2 Summary:**  

I went 2-1 with a Blue-Red Fling deck and 1-1-1 with a White-Black deck with nothing spectacular.


**What was your favorite memory this weekend?**  

I loved every moment that I won with [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling)!


**What is your favorite rare, uncommon and common in *Amonkhet* Limited, and why?**   
[Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer), because well, you tell me... I also like [Bone Picker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Picker) because it is like a one mana card. As for my favorite common, it is [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling)!


**Trials are a centric theme in *Amonkhet*. What was the biggest trial/challenge you faced this weekend?**   

The Day Two Booster Draft portion was very difficult. It is very different from other Booster Draft formats.

[Liliana, Death's Majesty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+Death%27s+Majesty) is great. I have won all my games on Magic Online whenever I cast her. [Lay Bare the Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+Bare+the+Heart) is a great card that helps me win sideboard games. My favorite common is [Final Reward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Reward), and I especially love it when I used it to kill [Angel of Sanctions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Sanctions) forever!


**Trials are a centric theme in *Amonkhet*. What was the biggest trial/challenge you faced this weekend?**
