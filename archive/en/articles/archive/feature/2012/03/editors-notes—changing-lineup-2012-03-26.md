Change is inevitable. This week, you're going to begin seeing and hearing about some upcoming changes to **DailyMTG.com**. Normally, I'd let the writers spread the word themselves, but since we have a bit of a shuffle taking place, it seemed only fitting that I give you a rundown of what is happening.

### Savor the Flavor's Transition

Savor the Flavor is going through a metamorphosis. Doug Beyer has written the column for more than four years and has decided he's ready to step back from the weekly column. This week's will be his last as the regular weekly columnist you know and love. That isn't to say he won't still be writing for us, but that he's going to be writing features and one-offs from time to time.

We'll have two preview articles for Savor the Flavor during the upcoming *Avacyn Restored* preview weeks, but beyond that the column will be sporadic until we find a new writer for it. The creative team at Wizards is a busy bunch and we're exploring how best to serve the story audience and balance the workload a weekly column creates.

I want to stress that this column is going to come back, I just don't know when or with whom. Hang in there; the stories from **Magic** will continue to flow.

### Limited Information's Lateral Shift

To accommodate the upcoming hole in the scheduling left where Savor the Flavor would sit, I am shifting Steve Sadin to Wednesdays starting next week. This is just a minor scheduling change and will not affect the contents of the column.

For clarification, Steve's next columns appear tomorrow, March 27, and then on Wednesday, April 4.

### ReConstructed's Introduction

To fill the programming hole on Tuesday, we are introducing a new column, titled ReConstructed.

ReConstructed will be a column focused on deck building, specifically aimed at helping players modify and improve their own decks. Readers will be invited to email their decklists and possibly see them discussed and modified in a weekly column.

Gavin has been a **Magic** writer for StarCityGames.com as well as a commentator for them during their Open events. He's been the pen behind our Daily Decks for several months now and he is particularly capable for this weekly column.

You'll get to read Gavin's first column tomorrow alongside Steve and Adam (before next week's shift when Steve will move to Wednesday)!

### Final Thoughts

I'm eager to hear your feedback on these changes. I'm sure some will be excited and some might be upset. If you want to send me your feedback you can use the email address at the bottom of this article or [tweet to me](http://www.twitter.com/trickmtg).
