Card of the Day - December, 2013
================================

 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years.

**[Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3644)** – *Visions*. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. Ken Nagle and Shawn Main picked [Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3644). Ken said, "[Uktabi Orangutan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Orangutan), [Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3644), and friends showcased the 'enter the battlefield'-with-a-spell effect, creating powerful creatures for tournament play thanks to their warm bodies being relevant all the time, even if the [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) effect was not. **Magic** sets nowadays are full of 'enters the battlefield' abilities." 
 


![140233](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=140233)
  
**[Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=140233)** – *Lorwyn*. For 20th Anniversary Week, we asked R&D for the most important cards in **Magic**'s history. Worth Wollpert and Shawn Main picked the first Planeswalkers. Shawn explains, "[Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=140233) and the rest of the [*Lorwyn* 5](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5B%22Lorwyn%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Planeswalker%22%5D)  represented a huge boon to the game. Planeswalkers had been central to the game's story from very early, but finally they had the opportunity to become part of the game."

Stocking Tiger – 2013 Holiday Promo.

Although it's not part of the [Power Nine](/en/articles/archive/power-nine-2003-10-15-0), many (perhaps most?) players consider the Library to be the tenth Power.

![1621](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1621)**[Ivory Guardians](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1621)** – *Legends*. Mesas have been a part of **Magic** since Alpha. They are home not only to [pegasuses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=259) but also [falcons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3022) and [chickens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5725), and upon them live both [enchantresses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126214) and, [according to flavor text](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=122324), high priests (who are guarded by these ivory giants). On Zendikar, they are [arid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=177584), but in Femeref, [sacred](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3512). 
 


![Soulbound Guardians](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soulbound+Guardians)**[Soulbound Guardians](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulbound+Guardians)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi*. We know the land-loving kor of Zendikar live as nomads, but why? The world guide for Zendikar explains: "The kor are nomads not because they despise locations, but because they revere too many to stay in any one place." And: "They travel in small bands along one of several pilgrimage routes, visiting dozens of sacred sites across Zendikar. Each pilgrimage circuit takes decades, and many are lost along the way to Zendikar's dangers." 
 


![Guardians' Pledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guardians%27+Pledge)**[Guardians' Pledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardians%27+Pledge)** – *Magic 2012*. Building a mono-white deck with lots of combat tricks isn't hard, as white has  [forty-six that affect *all* creatures you control](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5Bcreatures%5D+%5Byou%5D+%5Bcontrol%5D&color=+%40%28+%5BW%5D%29&type=+%5B%22Instant%22%5D)  and [thirty-four that care about individuals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5Btarget%5D+%5Bcreature%5D+%5Byou%5D+%5Bcontrol%5D&color=+%40%28+%5BW%5D%29&type=+%5B%22Instant%22%5D). White is [the color of community, strategy, and defense](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/great-white-way-2003-02-03), so a lot of its combat tricks provide various kinds of [protection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&color=+%40%28+%5BW%5D%29&type=+%5B%22Instant%22%5D&text=+%5Bprotection%5D) for its creatures, as well as [boosting numbers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&color=+%40%28+%5BW%5D%29&type=+%5B%22Instant%22%5D&text=+%5B+%5D+%5Byou%5D). 
 


![Guardians of Akrasa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guardians+of+Akrasa)**[Guardians of Akrasa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardians+of+Akrasa)** – *Magic 2013*. Akrasa was a nation of the Alara shard of Bant, a place with only green, white, and blue mana. As the [*Planeswalker's Guide to Alara*](/en/articles/archive/planeswalkers-guide-alara-2009-02-12) tells us, "Akrasa... is a land of fertile plains all put to agriculture. Several knightly orders are based in Akrasa, and its own armies are quite large. Akrasa has the largest number of ancient tower and castles of any kingdom...." Bant (and by extension, Alara) is also the first plane where we met our favorite [Knight-Errant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174859)! 
 


![Guardians of Meletis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guardians+of+Meletis)**[Guardians of Meletis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardians+of+Meletis)** – *Theros*. In his "[Pick a Side, Any Side](/en/articles/archive/pick-side-any-side-2011-02-21)" article, Mark Rosewater wrote, "the best thing **Magic** can show off creatively is an environment. The genre of a trading card game requires that you show lots of creatures and places and objects. This does a good job of showing off a diverse environment." This also allows us to tell little stories that aren't obvious. The art and flavor text of the Guardians [tell one such easily missed story](http://dougbeyermtg.tumblr.com/post/61385493599/are-the-guardians-or-meletis-magics-first-gay-couple). 
 


![Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea)**[Thassa, God of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea)** – *Theros*. The Mono-Blue Devotion deck is pretty powerful in the current Standard metagame. In fact, the deck so dominated the early *Theros* Standard that both finalists at  [Pro Tour *Theros*](/en/events/coverage/dezani-proclaims-allez-les-bleus-pro-tour) ran it! The deck [continues to evolve](/en/events/coverage/owen-runs-it-back) along with the metagame, though, so if you are devoted to Thassa and her buddy, [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves), [there is still a lot of inspiration out there](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/pr/276). 
 


![Bloodthirsty Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre)**[Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre)** – *Chamions of Kamigawa*. Ever wonder what this *o-bakemono* (or ogre mage) is so devoted to? It turns out the Kamigawa world guide has the answer for us! To wit: "[Ogres](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=%5B%22Champions+of+Kamigawa%22%5D&subtype=+%5B%22Ogre%22%5D)... are wise and reclusive. They're also evil. They worship [*oni*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=%5B%22Champions+of+Kamigawa%22%5D&subtype=+%5B%22Demon%22%5D) ([Japanese demons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni)) with strange rituals involving fire, smoke, and blood." So there you go. One other fun fact about Kamigawa Ogres: "Scale: about 3 meters [10 feet] tall." 
 


![Increasing Devotion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Increasing+Devotion)**[Increasing Devotion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Increasing+Devotion)** – *Dark Ascension*. This Increasing card is part of [a five-card cycle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&sort=cn+&action=advanced&name=+%5BIncreasing%5D&set=+%5B%22Dark+Ascension%22%5D) (cards connected in some mechanical way, usually with one in each color). Mark Rosewater shares the story of how the Increasing cycle came about [in this article](/en/articles/archive/dark-shadows-part-2-2012-01-30), which (spoilers!) originally had nothing to do with *Dark Ascension*. 
 


![Pious Kitsune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pious+Kitsune)**[Pious Kitsune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pious+Kitsune)** – *Champions of Kamigawa*. Did you know? *Kitsune* is Japanese for "[fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune)." That makes sense in context of [the Kitsune cards from the Kamigawa block](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Kamigawa+Block%22%5D&name=+%5BKitsune%5D). Our pious little fox here benefits from the card [Eight-and-a-Half-Tails](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eight-and-a-Half-Tails), himself based on the legend of the [nine-tailed fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-tailed_fox) but with [his own story specific to Kamigawa](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/chk/eighthalf)! 
 


![Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Devoted+Druid)**[Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)** – *Shadowmoor*. The Druid has a long (well, about five years) and storied history of being used and abused by Johnny deckbuilders to create arbitrarily large numbers (with the help of +1/+1 counters), including several [Lab](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=fromthelab&description=house%20of%20cards) runners on this very website. The most recent example came from Mike Cannon, who concocted [a Modern-legal](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/252) arbitrarily large number engine with it!
