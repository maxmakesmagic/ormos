Grand Prix Chicago 2009
-----------------------


Two Victories in a Row for Gabriel Nassif!
==========================================




March 6-8, 2009












2009 Grand Prix Chicago
-----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpchi09/Champ_Nassif.jpg)He’s done it again! Just one week removed from his Pro Tour-Kyoto victory Gabriel Nassif has done it again! He is your 2009 Grand Prix-Chicago champion. The title comes at the height of discussion amongst the world over who the best active player is. After a blistering past few months, the talk of the community has centered around Luis Scott-Vargas, but with a win over the American in the Kyoto finals and now a Grand Prix victory one week later, Gabriel Nassif lays a solid claim to the title.


From the beginning, Chicago was an exciting event. With over 1,200 players, it *smashed* the previous attendance records for North America as players were ravenous to take on the Legacy format. The deck most talked about on the weekend? Counterbalance/Top, a powerful combination of cards when joined by Force of Will and Tarmogoyf. But when all the smoke had cleared, the Top 8 was filled with multiple archetypes including Ad Nauseam Tendrils, Dragon Stompy, Threshold, and aggressive creature decks.


Of course, when the Top 8 had played out, it was Nassif’s build of the CounterTop deck that emerged victorious. Congratulations to Gabriel Nassif, your 2009 Grand Prix-Chicago champion!

Quarterfinals: Paul Rietzl vs. Brian Six
----------------------------------------


*by Blake Rasmussen*

Both Paul Rietzl and Brian Six have some experience on the Pro Tour and Grand Prix stage. This was Six’s first Top 8 and Rietzl’s third. Both players had come to Chicago with decks expected to crush the control decks of the format, with Rietzl sporting a nearly mono black list and Brian Six playing Red/Green aggro with a full boat of [Price of Progress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Price+of+Progress). Unfortunately for both players, they didn’t find themselves sitting across from a [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) deck, meaning the round really could go either way.


Both decks were capable of blisteringly fast starts. Rietzl was powered by [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) and cheap disruption capable of throwing any deck off balance from the start, while Six was capable of dealing tons of damage before an opponent could get their legs under them. Rietzl, for one, didn’t like his chances.


“I need you to mulligan, and then I Hymn, Hymn,” said Rietzl.


**Game 1**  



Rietzl had the follow-up [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade), which was promptly hit by [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet). In turn, Rietzl’s spent the next two turns destroying land while Six only had [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), pretty lonely at 1/1.


Rietzl, begging his deck for a creature, came up with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) one turn and [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) the next, prompting the quick concession.


“That was the way I can win, right there,” said Rietzl.


Paul Rietzl 1 Brian Six 0


**Game 2**  



Both players kept their openers, and Six led with [Taiga](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taiga) and a [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape).


“Classic start,” said Rietzl.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpchi09/QF_Brian-Six.jpg) Rietzl had his own classic start with [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) into [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) (taking [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer)) and a [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) to take Price of Progess and a land.


“Here we go again,” said Six.


Six had an attack and a second [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), but nothing else.


Rietzl had a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to hold the fort while still at a healthy 16 life, and added a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) as Six played multiple lands while doing nothing much else. This freed Rietzle up to attack with both his creatures. Six declined to block, taking six, and was punished by Rietzl’s second [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Once again, Six was forced to pass with no play and no attack.


Rietzl again hit with [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) into [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), and Six responded with [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), hiding the top two cards on the bottom. The [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) then took Fireblast, leaving only [Price of Progress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Price+of+Progress) in hand. Rietzl used the remaining two mana to pump his [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade), which was double blocked by [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape)s. The [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s took Six to two, and facing a lethal army with few resources, he extended his hand.


Afterwards both players revealed their sideboard choices that, effectively, were nonexistent in this match.


Paul Rietzl defeats Brian Six 2-0
