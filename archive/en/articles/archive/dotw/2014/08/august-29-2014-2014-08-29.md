Wizards of the Coast




August 29, 2014
 










Last weekend featured two Grand Prix: Sydney, featuring *Magic 2015* Limited, and Kobe, featuring Modern.



In [Sydney](/node/262326), the field of 813 was knocked down to a Top 8 featuring three big heavy-hitters: two-time Australian Grand Prix winner and native James Zhang, Japanese pro Tomoharu Saito with his twentieth GP Top 8, and South Korean pro Park Jun Young with his fourth GP Top 8. In the end, however, it was Perth resident Paul Jackson who won the whole thing, ultimately denying James Zhang his third GP trophy in the finals and scoring a big win as the first player from Western Australia to take home the title.



Meanwhile, in [Kobe](/node/262046), 2,270 players showed up with their best Modern decks at the ready. Teruya Kakumae emerged victorious with a Burn deck that shows off just how fast the red-based archetype can be. This event marked back-to-back Pro Tour Sunday competitor Yuuki Ichikawa's first Grand Prix Top 8 as well. Kobe's Modern metagame proved to have some new decks and some new twists on old ideas, with Shouta Yasooka finishing just outside the Top 8 with a 13–2 record thanks to a deck centered around Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas.



On top of the GPs, some more decklists from the first round of World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers are in. The second round of qualifiers takes place this weekend, so good luck to those traveling to their WMCQ in your Standard rounds.



The Pro Tour Qualifier season tied to Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* came to a conclusion last weekend too, with players closing out the weekend strong in a season marked with Modern innovations. We've got the last supply of Modern decklists coming to you from this PTQ season. Up next is the PTQ season that will qualify winners for Pro Tour Washington D.C. on February 6–8, 2015.
