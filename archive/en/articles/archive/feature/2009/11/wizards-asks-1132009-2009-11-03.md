*What's the worst card you ever won a game with?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_montyashley.jpg)**Monty Ashley:** In my very first tournament, back in 1995, I brought a blue-black deck to a *Fourth Edition* constructed tournament. I made it using the following highly scientific method:

1. Determine which blue cards are not already in my white-blue deck.
2. Determine which black cards are not already in my black-red deck.
3. Add 20 land

As you can see, I wasn't really prepared for a world where people did things like decide what cards belonged in their decks ahead of time. Still, I managed to win a game.

Here was the situation: I had an [Abomination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abomination) locking down the ground. My opponent had a fancy mono-white deck and was beating me down with a [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel). So already, I'm pretty far behind on card quality.

My opponent attacked for the third or fourth time through the air. I held up a finger to indicate that he was prematurely marking my life down four points.

I played [Jump](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jump) on my [Abomination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abomination).

![Jump](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jump)[Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel): dead. Opponent's morale: crushed. Game: won.
