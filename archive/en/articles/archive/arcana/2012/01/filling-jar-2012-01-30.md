Back when we showed off the [*Dark Ascension* Art Gallery](/en/articles/archive/dark-ascension-art-gallery-2012-01-04), there was a mysterious piece of art that kind of stood out.

"What is this mysterious jar of eyeballs?" asked people around the Internet. And soon, the answer was made clear: it was [Jar of Eyeballs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jar+of+Eyeballs).

Now, we're not mentioning this just to show off a jar of eyeballs. That's the main reason, obviously. But we also thought it would be fun to look at the original sketch, before the eyeballs got finished.
