The streets grow restless in New Capenna. Tensions between the families are reaching a fever pitch, and the alleys whisper of coming violence. No one's quite sure what started all. Do the Obscura have something on the Brokers? Did the Riveteers steal from Maestros? Goodness knows the Cabaretti are ready . . . whatever the cause, one thing is clear: this means brawl.
