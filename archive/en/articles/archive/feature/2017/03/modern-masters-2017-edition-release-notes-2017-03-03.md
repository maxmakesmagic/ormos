The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set’s cards. It’s intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can’t find the answer you’re looking for here, please contact us at [**Wizards.com/CustomerService**](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The “General Notes” section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The “Card-Specific Notes” section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the “Card-Specific Notes” section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**GENERAL NOTES**


**What is Modern Masters?**


The *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* set is a follow-up to the previous *Modern Masters* sets in 2013 and 2015. Some of the most beloved and iconic cards from the Modern format will appear in the same booster packs, and an all-new Limited experience will have you drafting your old favorites in exciting new ways. The *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* set takes players back to some of the most remarkable planes from recent history, including Innistrad, Zendikar, New Phyrexia, Alara, and Ravnica.


**Release Information**


The *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* set contains 249 cards (101 common, 80 uncommon, 53 rare, and 15 mythic rare).


Release date: March 17, 2017


*Magic Online* release date: March 23, 2017


Go to [**Wizards.com/Locator**](http://www.wizards.com/locator) to find an event or store near you.


**Format Legality**


All cards in the *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* set are legal in the Modern format. Inclusion in the *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* set doesn’t change what other formats a card is legal in.


Go to [**Magic.Wizards.com/Rules**](http://magic.wizards.com/rules) for a complete list of formats and permitted card sets.




---

**Returning Mechanics**


All cards in the *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* set have previously appeared in other *Magic* sets. Accordingly, several keywords and other mechanics make their return. None of the rules regarding these mechanics have changed since they last appeared.




---

**Bloodrush**


Bloodrush is an ability word originally featured in the *Gatecrash* set. It ties together abilities that allow you to discard a creature card in exchange for a powerful boost to an attacking creature. An ability word has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_h0Tm0ckJRU.png)


Slaughterhorn  

2G  

Creature — Beast  

3/2  
*Bloodrush* — G, Discard Slaughterhorn: Target attacking creature gets +3/+2 until end of turn.


* Activating a creature card’s bloodrush ability isn’t the same as casting the creature card. The bloodrush ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with bloodrush abilities, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Cancel) will not.



---

**Conspire**


The conspire ability from the *Shadowmoor* set lets your creatures work together to make your spells better. Tap two of them, and you’ll get a copy of that spell.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_u08NJOSojM.png)


Giantbaiting  

2R/G  

Sorcery  

Create a 4/4 red and green Giant Warrior creature token with haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.  

Conspire *(As you cast this spell, you may tap two untapped creatures you control that share a color with it. When you do, copy it.)*


* Once you begin to cast a spell with conspire, no player may take other actions until you’re done. Notably, opponents can’t try to remove the creatures you wish to tap.
* You can choose to pay a conspire cost only once. You can’t tap more creatures to get multiple copies of the spell.
* If you choose to pay a conspire cost of a multicolored spell, the two creatures you tap don’t need to share a color with each other. Each one just needs to share a color with the spell that has conspire. For example, you could tap one red creature and one green creature to pay the conspire cost of Giantbaiting, no matter how you pay for the R/G in its mana cost.
* Conspire will create a copy of that spell even if the spell is countered.
* You can’t choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it’s not “cast.” Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as conspire) won’t trigger for the copy.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it’s copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can’t choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).



---

**Flashback**


Flashback is an ability that lets you cast a spell from your graveyard. It originally appeared in the *Odyssey* block and appeared more recently in the *Innistrad* block.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_Q4sSmOCmhw.png)


Unburial Rites  

4B  

Sorcery  

Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.  

Flashback 3W *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*


* You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card’s type. For instance, you can only cast a sorcery using flashback when you could normally cast a sorcery.
* Casting a spell using flashback doesn’t change the mana cost (or converted mana cost) of the spell. You just pay the flashback cost instead.
* Effects that cause you to pay more or less when casting a spell will also affect what you pay when casting the spell using flashback.
* A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it’s countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.
* You can cast a spell using flashback even if it was somehow put into your graveyard without having been cast.



---

**“Flickering”** 


Several cards pull a card off the battlefield entirely and then return it—sometimes to protect it from harm, sometimes to stop it from doing harm. This mechanic is colloquially known as “flickering.”


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_2EAVpIFW3a.png)


Flickerwisp  

1WW  

Creature — Elemental  

3/1  

Flying  

When Flickerwisp enters the battlefield, exile another target permanent. Return that card to the battlefield under its owner’s control at the beginning of the next end step.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_8RC1p27tEB.png)


Ghostly Flicker  

2U  

Instant  

Exile two target artifacts, creatures, and/or lands you control, then return those cards to the battlefield under your control.


* Some flickering effects return the exiled permanent right away, and some return it at a later time. Some flickering effects return the exiled permanent to the battlefield under its owner’s control, and some return it under your control regardless of who owns it. Make sure to read carefully to determine which rules apply to an individual card.
* Once the exiled permanent returns, it’s considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners’ graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* If a flickering effect returns the exiled card right away, it won’t be the target of any spells or abilities that targeted it before. Any spells that don’t target it, such as Damnation, will still affect it.
* If a flickering effect returns the exiled card “at the beginning” of a step and that card has an ability that also triggers “at the beginning” of that step, it won’t trigger right away after returning to the battlefield.
* If a flickering effect returns the exiled card “under your control,” you control it indefinitely after that. When you leave a multiplayer game, exile any objects that you put onto the battlefield under your control but don’t own.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won’t return to the battlefield.



---

**Miracle**


The *Avacyn Restored* set taught us that a well-timed miracle can turn the tide of battle. The miracle keyword lets you cast a spell with a tremendous discount if it’s your first draw for a turn and you cast it right away. Cards with miracle feature a modified frame to immediately let you know that you’ve drawn one.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_nWAqNs8shh.png)


Terminus  

4WW  

Sorcery  

Put all creatures on the bottom of their owners’ libraries.  

Miracle W *(You may cast this card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it’s the first card you drew this turn.)*


* It’s important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
* You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it’s the first card you’ve drawn that turn.
* If an effect puts a card into your hand without using the word “draw,” the card wasn’t drawn.
* You don’t have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don’t wish to cast it at that time.
* You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don’t want to cast it at that time (or you can’t cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won’t be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
* You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing rules based on the card’s type.
* Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven’t drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you’ll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
* If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won’t be able to cast it using its miracle ability.
* You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don’t cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.
* You draw your opening hand before any turn begins. Cards you draw for your opening hand can’t be cast using miracle.
* You may pay additional costs, such as conspire, while casting a card for its miracle cost.



---

**Overload**


Overload is an ability from the *Return to Ravnica* set found on some instants or sorceries that broadens their scope—because why settle for anything less than everything?


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_1iiIxBrGTO.png)


Cyclonic Rift  

1U  

Instant  

Return target nonland permanent you don’t control to its owner’s hand.  

Overload 6U *(You may cast this spell for its overload cost. If you do, change its text by replacing all instances of “target” with “each.”)*


* If you don’t pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won’t have any targets.
* Because a spell with overload doesn’t target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with shroud or hexproof. For example, if you cast Cyclonic Rift and pay its overload cost, a creature you don’t control with hexproof is returned to its owner’s hand.
* Overload doesn’t change when you can cast the spell.
* Casting a spell with overload doesn’t change that spell’s mana cost or converted mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
* Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
* If you copy a spell with overload that was cast for its overload cost, the copy is also overloaded.
* If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload “without paying its mana cost,” you can’t choose to pay its overload cost instead. The same is true if you’re casting a spell for any other alternative cost, such as a flashback cost. You may pay additional costs, such as conspire.



---

**Populate**


Populate is an ability from the *Return to Ravnica* set that lets you recruit new creatures into your welcoming ranks by copying creature tokens you control.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_9IP6SvcRK2.png)


Eyes in the Skies  

3W  

Instant  

Create a 1/1 white Bird creature token with flying, then populate. *(Create a token that’s a copy of a creature token you control.)*


* Once you begin to resolve a spell or ability that populates, no player may take other actions until you’re done. Notably, opponents can’t stop you from copying the creature token you’ve chosen by removing that creature token.
* You can choose any creature token you control. If a spell or ability creates a token under your control and then instructs you to populate (as Eyes in the Skies does), you may choose to copy the token you just created, or you may choose to copy another creature token you control.
* If you choose to copy a creature token that’s a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.
* The new creature token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that created the original token.
* The new token doesn’t copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, color, and so on.
* Any “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the new token will work.
* If you control no creature tokens when you populate, nothing will happen.



---

**Regenerate**


Regenerate is a returning keyword action from many years of *Magic’s* history that spares a creature from destruction.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_gRM8mop8p1.png)


Carnage Gladiator  

2BR  

Creature — Skeleton Warrior  

4/2  

Whenever a creature blocks, that creature’s controller loses 1 life.  

1BR: Regenerate Carnage Gladiator.


* When you regenerate a permanent, you’re creating a replacement effect “shield” to be used later. That effect means “The next time [that permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.”
* A permanent can regenerate even if it’s already tapped.
* If an effect says that a permanent “can’t be regenerated,” a regeneration “shield” can still be created, but that replacement effect can’t be applied if that permanent would be destroyed.
* A permanent that regenerates doesn’t leave or enter the battlefield. Abilities that trigger on a creature dying or entering the battlefield won’t trigger if a creature regenerates.
* Permanents are destroyed by effects that use the word “destroy.” Creatures are also destroyed by having lethal damage marked on them. Sacrificing a permanent doesn’t destroy it, nor does reducing a creature’s toughness to 0.
* If a permanent would be destroyed in two ways at once, one regeneration shield protects it from both. This will happen, for example, if a creature with deathtouch deals damage to another creature that’s greater than or equal to that creature’s toughness.



---

**Soulbond**


Originally featured in the *Avacyn Restored* set, creatures with soulbond seek out others for their mutual support and improvement.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_5HaDXAkX6m.png)


Hanweir Lancer  

2R  

Creature — Human Knight  

2/2  

Soulbond *(You may pair this creature with another unpaired creature when either enters the battlefield. They remain paired for as long as you control both of them.)*  

As long as Hanweir Lancer is paired with another creature, both creatures have first strike.


* Soulbond represents two triggered abilities that are summarized with its reminder text. The official rules for soulbond include the full text of these triggered abilities: “Soulbond” means “When this creature enters the battlefield, if you control both this creature and another creature and both are unpaired, you may pair this creature with another unpaired creature you control for as long as both remain creatures on the battlefield under your control” and “Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, if you control both that creature and this one and both are unpaired, you may pair that creature with this creature for as long as both remain creatures on the battlefield under your control.”
* Two paired creatures are still individual creatures in every way: they attack and block individually, they are targeted and affected by spells or abilities individually, and they change zones individually. If two paired creatures are attacking, blocking one of them has no effect on the other, for example.
* A creature can be paired with only one other creature. You can’t choose to break a pairing in order to pair with a new creature.
* You must control another unpaired creature at the moment a creature with soulbond enters the battlefield, or the soulbond ability won’t trigger at all. However, the creature that pairs with the creature with soulbond isn’t chosen until the soulbond ability resolves.
* If you control multiple unpaired creatures with soulbond and another creature enters the battlefield, each soulbond ability will trigger. Soulbond abilities that try to resolve after you pair the creature will have no effect.
* If the pair is broken, the bonuses and abilities granted to the creatures immediately disappear. If the bonus a damaged creature was receiving included an increase to toughness, losing that bonus may cause the damage to be lethal. If that happens, the creature is destroyed. Similarly, if losing the bonus causes the creature to have 0 toughness, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard.
* If becoming unpaired causes a creature to no longer have an activated ability, instances of that ability that have already been activated and are on the stack are unaffected.
* A creature with soulbond may grant an ability to itself and the creature it’s paired with that includes the text “this creature.” In such abilities, “this creature” refers only to the creature that has that ability, not to the creature it’s paired with.
* If a creature with soulbond is paired with another creature with soulbond, each of them will receive both bonuses.



---

**Traps**


The wild world of the *Zendikar* set featured several Trap cards to punish players who would step incautiously. The Trap spell type has no rules meaning, but each Trap has an ability that greatly reduces its cost if certain conditions are met.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_O7NepI5dTc.png)


Pitfall Trap  

2W  

Instant — Trap  

If exactly one creature is attacking, you may pay W rather than pay Pitfall Trap’s mana cost.  

Destroy target attacking creature without flying.


* You may ignore a Trap’s alternative cost and simply cast it for its normal mana cost. This is true even if its alternative cost condition has been met.
* Casting a Trap by paying its alternative cost doesn’t change its mana cost or converted mana cost.
* Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast a Trap will apply to whichever cost you chose to pay. This is true even if the Trap’s alternative cost is 0.
* If you’re casting a Trap spell for any other alternative cost, such as a flashback cost, you can’t choose to pay its printed alternative cost instead.
* You may pay additional costs, such as conspire, while casting a card for its alternative cost.



---

**Unearth**


Flashback’s great for reusing spells, but what about when you want a second use out of creatures? The *Shards of Alara* set brought us the answer to that question: the unearth keyword lets you bring a creature back for one last swing.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_KCyWgANAtw.png)


Dregscape Zombie  

1B  

Creature — Zombie  

2/1  

Unearth B *(B: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield. It gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step or if it would leave the battlefield. Unearth only as a sorcery.)*


* You may activate the unearth ability of a card in your graveyard no matter how it wound up in your graveyard.
* Activating a creature card’s unearth ability isn’t the same as casting the creature card. The unearth ability is put on the stack, but the creature card is not. Spells and abilities that interact with activated abilities (such as Stifle) will interact with unearth, but spells and abilities that interact with spells (such as Cancel) will not.
* If you activate a card’s unearth ability but that card is removed from your graveyard before the ability resolves, that unearth ability will resolve and do nothing.
* At the beginning of the next end step, a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth is exiled. This is a delayed triggered ability, and it can be countered by spells such as Disallow that counter triggered abilities. If the ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the delayed trigger won’t trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature if it ever leaves the battlefield.
* If a creature returned to the battlefield with unearth would leave it for any reason, it’s exiled instead—unless the spell or ability that’s causing the creature to leave the battlefield is actually trying to exile it. In that case, it succeeds at exiling the creature. If it later returns the creature card to the battlefield (as Flickerwisp might, for example), the creature card will return as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The unearth effect will no longer apply to it.
* If an object becomes a copy of an unearthed creature, the copy won’t be exiled at the beginning of the next end step or if it would leave the battlefield.

**CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_H6oxSsAHao.png)


Abrupt Decay  

BG  

Instant  

Abrupt Decay can’t be countered by spells or abilities.  

Destroy target nonland permanent with converted mana cost 3 or less.


* The converted mana cost of a creature token is 0, unless that token is a copy of another creature, in which case it copies that creature’s mana cost.
* If a permanent has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_8AN8Hb3Jyn.png)


Aethermage’s Touch  

2WU  

Instant  

Reveal the top four cards of your library. You may put a creature card from among them onto the battlefield. It gains “At the beginning of your end step, return this creature to its owner’s hand.” Then put the rest of the cards revealed this way on the bottom of your library in any order.


* If you don’t reveal any creature cards, or if you choose not to put a revealed creature card onto the battlefield, all the revealed cards go on the bottom of your library.
* If the creature that you put onto the battlefield leaves the battlefield before your next end step, it won’t be returned to your hand at the beginning of your next end step.
* If you put a creature onto the battlefield this way during your end step, it won’t be returned to your hand until your next end step.
* The triggered ability that the creature gains won’t be copied if an effect creates a token that’s a copy of that creature or causes another object to become a copy of that creature.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_gd7rFGH9YY.png)


Agony Warp  

UB  

Instant  

Target creature gets -3/-0 until end of turn.  

Target creature gets -0/-3 until end of turn.


* The two targets may be the same creature or they may be different creatures.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_aBtbRRQMbY.png)


Arachnus Spinner  

5G  

Creature — Spider  

5/7  

Reach  

Tap an untapped Spider you control: Search your graveyard and/or library for a card named Arachnus Web and put it onto the battlefield attached to target creature. If you search your library this way, shuffle it.


* You can tap any untapped Spider you control, including one you haven’t controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, to pay the cost of Arachnus Spinner’s activated ability. You can even tap Arachnus Spinner itself to pay this cost.
* If you choose to search your library this way, you don’t have to find a card named Arachnus Web, even if one is there. You’ll still shuffle your library after searching it.
* You may search both your graveyard and your library, but you can find a maximum of one card named Arachnus Web.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_1mE6ispO94.png)


Arachnus Web  

2G  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature can’t attack or block, and its activated abilities can’t be activated.  

At the beginning of the end step, if enchanted creature’s power is 4 or greater, destroy Arachnus Web.


* Arachnus Web’s triggered ability checks at the beginning of each end step, not just yours.
* If the enchanted creature’s power isn’t 4 or greater when the end step begins, the last ability won’t trigger at all.
* If Arachnus Web’s last ability triggers, but the enchanted creature’s power is reduced to 3 or less before the ability resolves, the ability will have no effect. Arachnus Web won’t be destroyed.
* If Arachnus Web enters the battlefield attached to an attacking or blocking creature (due to Arachnus Spinner’s ability, for example), that creature will continue to attack or block.
* Activated abilities contain a colon. They’re generally written “[Cost]: [Effect].” Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.
* Triggered abilities (starting with “when,” “whenever,” or “at”) are unaffected.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_FnnqXFRtAC.png)


Baloth Cage Trap  

3GG  

Instant — Trap  

If an opponent had an artifact enter the battlefield under his or her control this turn, you may pay 1G rather than pay Baloth Cage Trap’s mana cost.  

Create a 4/4 green Beast creature token.


* Baloth Cage Trap checks to see if an opponent had an artifact enter the battlefield under his or her control this turn. It doesn’t matter if that permanent is still on the battlefield or is still an artifact, and it doesn’t matter if that opponent is still in the game. If that event happened at some point during the turn, Baloth Cage Trap can be cast for its alternative cost.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_ogm6qiSdCS.png)


Battle-Rattle Shaman  

3R  

Creature — Goblin Shaman  

2/2  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, you may have target creature get +2/+0 until end of turn.


* Battle-Rattle Shaman’s ability triggers when the beginning of combat step starts during each of your turns. It resolves before you declare attackers.
* If a spell or ability causes your turn to have multiple combat phases, Battle Rattle Shaman’s ability triggers during each of them.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/b9jm8nwv_mm3/en_nOqiz0pge6.png)


Blood Moon  

2R  

Enchantment  

Nonbasic lands are Mountains.


* Nonbasic lands will lose any other land types and abilities they had. They will gain the land type Mountain and gain the ability “T: Add R to your mana pool.”
* Blood Moon’s effect doesn’t affect names or supertypes. It won’t turn any land into a basic land or remove the legendary supertype from a legendary land, and the lands won’t be named “Mountain.”
* If a nonbasic land has an ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped, that ability will still function. For example, if Blood Crypt is entering the battlefield, its controller may pay 2 life to have it enter untapped. Regardless of this choice, it will be only a Mountain and not a Swamp. The same is also true of any other abilities that modify how a land enters the battlefield or apply “as” a land enters the battlefield, such as the first ability of Cavern of Souls.
* If a nonbasic land has an ability that triggers “when” it enters the battlefield, it will lose that ability before it triggers.

Bone Splinters

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast Bone Splinters, sacrifice a creature.  

Destroy target creature.


* You must sacrifice exactly one creature to cast this spell; you can’t cast it without sacrificing a creature, and you can’t sacrifice additional creatures.
* Once you begin to cast Bone Splinters, no player may take actions until you’re done. Notably, opponents can’t try to remove the creature you wish to sacrifice.
* You can cast Bone Splinters targeting the creature you intend to sacrifice for its cost. This is because targets are chosen before costs are paid. Bone Splinters will be countered as it tries to resolve in this case.

Bonfire of the Damned  

XXR  

Sorcery  

Bonfire of the Damned deals X damage to target player and each creature he or she controls.  

Miracle XR *(You may cast this card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it’s the first card you drew this turn.)*


* Bonfire of the Damned targets only the player. Creatures with shroud or hexproof that player controls will be dealt damage by Bonfire of the Damned if it resolves.
* A mana cost of XX means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay 6R to cast Bonfire of the Damned.
* Bonfire of the Damned’s converted mana cost is based on its mana cost of XXR, even if you’re casting it for its miracle cost. For example, if you cast Bonfire of the Damned for its miracle cost and choose 4 for X, its converted mana cost is 9.
* If the player is an illegal target when Bonfire of the Damned tries to resolve, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No damage will be dealt to any creature or player.
* Preventing some or all of the damage dealt to the player won’t affect the amount of damage dealt to each creature that player controls. The same is true for any effect that increases or decreases the amount of damage dealt to the player.

Boros Reckoner  

R/WR/WR/W  

Creature — Minotaur Wizard  

3/3  

Whenever Boros Reckoner is dealt damage, it deals that much damage to target creature or player.  

R/W: Boros Reckoner gains first strike until end of turn.


* Boros Reckoner’s first ability will trigger even if it is dealt lethal damage. For example, if it blocks a 7/7 creature, its ability will trigger and Boros Reckoner will deal 7 damage to the target creature or player.
* Damage dealt by Boros Reckoner due to its first ability isn’t combat damage, even if it was combat damage that caused that ability to trigger.
* If Boros Reckoner is dealt damage by multiple sources at once, such as by two creatures blocking it, its ability triggers once and one target is dealt that much damage.

Cackling Counterpart  

1UU  

Instant  

Create a token that’s a copy of target creature you control.  

Flashback 5UU *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*


* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token that’s created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token.
* If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is an Evil Twin), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the chosen creature will also work.

Cavern of Souls  

Land  

As Cavern of Souls enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.  

T: Add C to your mana pool.  

T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool. Spend this mana only to cast a creature spell of the chosen type, and that spell can’t be countered.


* You must choose an existing creature type, such as Zombie or Warrior. Card types such as artifact can’t be chosen.
* The spell can’t be countered if the mana produced by Cavern of Souls is spent to cover any cost of the spell, even an additional cost such as a kicker cost. This is true even if you use the mana to pay an additional cost while casting a spell “without paying its mana cost.”

Haste  

When Craterhoof Behemoth enters the battlefield, creatures you control gain trample and get +X/+X until end of turn, where X is the number of creatures you control.


* The value of X is determined only as Craterhoof Behemoth’s triggered ability resolves, potentially including Craterhoof Behemoth itself. It won’t change later in the turn if the number of creatures you control changes.
* Craterhoof Behemoth’s triggered ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. It won’t affect creatures that come under your control later in the turn.

Cruel Ultimatum  

UUBBBRR  

Sorcery  

Target opponent sacrifices a creature, discards three cards, then loses 5 life. You return a creature card from your graveyard to your hand, draw three cards, then gain 5 life.


* Cruel Ultimatum’s only target is an opponent. You don’t choose which creature card in your graveyard you’ll return to your hand until Cruel Ultimatum resolves.
* All of the actions for Cruel Ultimatum are performed sequentially, in the order listed. Earlier actions may affect how you perform later actions. For example, if the opponent sacrifices a creature that he or she controls but you own, it will end up in your graveyard. When Cruel Ultimatum lets you return a creature card from your graveyard to your hand, you can choose that one.
* If, as Cruel Ultimatum begins to resolve, your opponent’s life total is 5 or less and you have two or fewer cards in your library, the game will result in a draw. Your opponent’s life total will drop to 0 or less, but Cruel Ultimatum must finish resolving completely before state-based actions are performed. You’ll then be forced to draw three cards and fail to draw one. When state-based actions are finally performed, you and your opponent will both lose the game at the same time, which means the game is a draw.

Damping Matrix  

3  

Artifact  

Activated abilities of artifacts and creatures can’t be activated unless they’re mana abilities.


* Activated abilities contain a colon. They’re generally written “[Cost]: [Effect].” Some keyword abilities, such as equip, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text.
* A mana ability is an ability that produces mana, not an ability that costs mana.
* Damping Matrix’s ability affects only artifacts and creatures on the battlefield. Activated abilities that work in other zones (such as bloodrush or unearth) can still be activated. Triggered abilities (starting with “when,” “whenever,” or “at”) are unaffected.

Deadeye Navigator  

4UU  

Creature — Spirit  

5/5  

Soulbond *(You may pair this creature with another unpaired creature when either enters the battlefield. They remain paired for as long as you control both of them.)*  

As long as Deadeye Navigator is paired with another creature, each of those creatures has “1U: Exile this creature, then return it to the battlefield under your control.”


* If you activate the ability granted by Deadeye Navigator, the creature will be exiled, the pair will immediately be broken, and then the card will be returned to the battlefield. Deadeye Navigator’s soulbond ability triggers when that card enters the battlefield and the pair can then be reunited.
* Once Deadeye Navigator or the creature it’s paired with is exiled, the other creature will no longer have the activated ability. However, you can activate the ability of one creature in response to activating the ability of the other creature.

B  

Creature — Avatar  

13/13  

Death’s Shadow gets -X/-X, where X is your life total.


* Death’s Shadow’s ability applies only while Death’s Shadow is on the battlefield. In all other zones, its power and toughness are 13.
* The value of X changes as you gain and lose life. It’s not locked in as Death’s Shadow enters the battlefield.
* If your life total is 13 or greater and nothing else is boosting the toughness of Death’s Shadow, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, your life total is your team’s life total.

* Players won’t know which player or planeswalker Desecration Demon will attack, if any, when deciding whether to sacrifice a creature.
* Each opponent in turn order may choose to sacrifice a creature, even if an opponent already chose to sacrifice a creature that combat. Desecration Demon will have a maximum of one +1/+1 counter put on it each combat, no matter how many creatures were sacrificed.

Domri Rade  

1RG  

Planeswalker — Domri  

3  

+1: Look at the top card of your library. If it’s a creature card, you may reveal it and put it into your hand.  

−2: Target creature you control fights another target creature.  

−7: You get an emblem with “Creatures you control have double strike, trample, hexproof, and haste.”


* When resolving Domri’s first ability, if the card you look at isn’t a creature card, or if it’s a creature card you don’t want to put into your hand, you simply put it back on top of your library. You don’t reveal it or say why you’re putting it back.
* The second target of Domri’s second ability can be another creature you control, but it can’t be the same creature as the first target.
* If either target of Domri’s second ability is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage.
* If a creature has both double strike and trample, the combat damage it assigned during the first combat damage step will be considered when determining how much damage can trample through in the second combat damage step. If each creature blocking it is destroyed during the first combat damage step, then all of the damage must be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker during the second combat damage step.

Overload 2R *(You may cast this spell for its overload cost. If you do, change its text by replacing all instances of “target” with “each.”)*

XXWWW  

Sorcery  

Create X 4/4 white Angel creature tokens with flying.  

Miracle XWW *(You may cast this card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it’s the first card you drew this turn.)*


* A mana cost of XX means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay 6WWW to cast Entreat the Angels.
* Entreat the Angels’s converted mana cost is based on its mana cost of XXWWW, even if you’re casting it for its miracle cost. For example, if you cast Entreat the Angels for its miracle cost and choose 4 for X, its converted mana cost is 11.

Evil Twin  

2UB  

Creature — Shapeshifter  

0/0  

You may have Evil Twin enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it gains “UB, T: Destroy target creature with the same name as this creature.”


* Evil Twin copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below) and it gains the activated ability. It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* The activated ability that Evil Twin gains as part of its copy effect is a copiable value that other effects may copy.
* If the chosen creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Evil Twin), then your Evil Twin enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Evil Twin copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Evil Twin is not a token in this case.
* Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was explicitly given a name by the effect that created it, its name is the creature types it was given when it was created. For example, the Beast tokens created by Thragtusk and by Baloth Cage Trap are both named “Beast.”
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Evil Twin enters the battlefield. Any “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Evil Twin somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Evil Twin can’t become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that’s already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Evil Twin enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.

Explore  

1G  

Sorcery  

You may play an additional land this turn.  

Draw a card.


* Explore’s effect allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands. In particular, you don’t get to play a land as Explore resolves; Explore fully resolves first and draws a card, perhaps a land you’ll play later.
* The effects of multiple Explores in the same turn are cumulative. They’re also cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from Urban Evolution.
* If you somehow manage to cast Explore when it’s not your turn, you’ll draw a card when it resolves, but you won’t be able to play a land that turn.

Fiery Justice  

RGW  

Sorcery  

Fiery Justice deals 5 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures and/or players. Target opponent gains 5 life.


* You choose how many targets Fiery Justice has and how the damage is divided as you cast it. Each target for its damage-dealing effect must receive at least 1 damage.
* If some (but not all) of the targets become illegal, the original division of damage still applies, but no damage is dealt to illegal targets. If all targets become illegal, including the target opponent for the life-gaining effect, Fiery Justice is countered. If each target for the damage-dealing effect becomes illegal while the target for the life-gaining effect remains legal, that player gains 5 life even though no damage is dealt.
* The target opponent for the life-gaining effect may also be a target for the damage-dealing effect. If this happens and the damage brings that player’s life total to 0 or less, the life-gaining effect will raise his or her life total above 0 again before the player would lose the game.

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

When Fists of Ironwood enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 green Saproling creature tokens.  

Enchanted creature has trample.


* You create the Saproling tokens, even if Fists of Ironwood enters the battlefield attached to another player’s creature.
* The Saproling tokens aren’t created until after Fists of Ironwood is on the battlefield, so you can’t cast Fists of Ironwood on one of those tokens.
* If the target creature is an illegal target when Fists of Ironwood tries to resolve, Fists of Ironwood will be countered and won’t enter the battlefield. You won’t create Saproling tokens.

Creature cards can’t enter the battlefield from graveyards or libraries.  

Players can’t cast cards in graveyards or libraries.


* If a creature card tries to enter the battlefield from a graveyard or library, it stays in its current zone.
* The first ability checks only whether the card is a creature card in the graveyard or library. A card such as Sculpting Steel can still enter the battlefield from a graveyard or library as a copy of a creature.
* The second ability doesn’t stop players from playing land cards from graveyards or libraries since lands aren’t cast.

* In some multiplayer variants, creatures you control may attack multiple players and/or planeswalkers. For each attacking creature, Hellrider will deal damage to the corresponding defending player.

Liliana of the Veil  

1BB  

Planeswalker — Liliana  

3  

+1: Each player discards a card.  

−2: Target player sacrifices a creature.  

−6: Separate all permanents target player controls into two piles. That player sacrifices all permanents in the pile of his or her choice.


* When Liliana’s first ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is chooses a card to discard, then each other player in turn order chooses a card to discard, then those cards are discarded simultaneously. No one sees what the other players are discarding before deciding which card to discard.
* The player targeted by Liliana’s second ability chooses which creature to sacrifice when the ability resolves. This ability doesn’t target any creature.
* When Liliana’s third ability resolves, you put each permanent the player controls into one of the two piles. For example, you could put a creature into one pile and an Aura enchanting that creature into the other pile.
* A pile can be empty. If the player chooses an empty pile, no permanents will be sacrificed.

When Master Splicer enters the battlefield, create a 3/3 colorless Golem artifact creature token.  

Golem creatures you control get +1/+1.


* If a creature has been dealt damage, that damage remains marked on it until the cleanup step. If Master Splicer leaves the battlefield and a Golem creature you control has been dealt damage, that creature will be destroyed if the damage is now lethal. Similarly, if that causes a Golem to have 0 toughness, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard.

Mogg Flunkies  

1R  

Creature — Goblin  

3/3  

Mogg Flunkies can’t attack or block alone.


* Mogg Flunkies can be declared as an attacker only if another creature is declared as an attacker at the same time. Similarly, Mogg Flunkies can be declared as a blocker only if another creature is declared as a blocker at the same time.
* Two or more Mogg Flunkies can attack or block together.
* Although Mogg Flunkies can’t attack alone, other attacking creature(s) don’t have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Mogg Flunkies could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls.
* If an effect says that Mogg Flunkies attacks or blocks if able and you control another creature able to attack or block, you must attack or block with Mogg Flunkies and that creature.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game (or in another format using the shared team turns option), Mogg Flunkies can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking. In any other multiplayer variant, it ignores each other player’s blocking creatures.

Mortician Beetle  

B  

Creature — Insect  

1/1  

Whenever a player sacrifices a creature, you may put a +1/+1 counter on Mortician Beetle.


* Mortician Beetle’s ability triggers whenever any player, including you, sacrifices a creature because some other spell, ability, or cost instructed the player to do so. Mortician Beetle itself doesn’t allow you to sacrifice any creatures.
* If a creature is sacrificed as a cost to cast a spell or activate an ability, Mortician Beetle’s ability resolves before that spell or ability.

Obzedat, Ghost Council

Legendary Creature — Spirit Advisor  

5/5  

When Obzedat, Ghost Council enters the battlefield, target opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.  

At the beginning of your end step, you may exile Obzedat. If you do, return it to the battlefield under its owner’s control at the beginning of your next upkeep. It gains haste.


* Once Obzedat’s ability has returned it to the battlefield, it has haste for as long as it remains on the battlefield. If an opponent gains control of it (perhaps with Olivia Voldaren or Soul Ransom), it can attack that turn.
* If you gain control of Obzedat “until end of turn,” you’ll control it during your end step and you choose whether to exile it. If you do, it returns to the battlefield under its owner’s control at the beginning of your next upkeep, not its owner’s next upkeep.

Defender  

Ogre Jailbreaker can attack as though it didn’t have defender as long as you control a Gate.

* If Olivia Voldaren deals lethal damage to a creature with its first activated ability, that creature will become a Vampire before dying.

Past in Flames

Sorcery  

Each instant and sorcery card in your graveyard gains flashback until end of turn. The flashback cost is equal to its mana cost.  

Flashback 4R *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*


* Only instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard when Past in Flames resolves will gain flashback. Instant and sorcery cards that are put into your graveyard later in the turn, including the resolving Past in Flames, won’t gain flashback.
* If you cast an instant or sorcery with X in its mana cost this way, you still choose the value of X as part of casting the spell and pay that cost.
* If an instant or sorcery card in your graveyard already has flashback, you may use either flashback ability to cast it from your graveyard.
* You may pay any optional additional costs the spell has, such as conspire costs. You must pay any mandatory additional costs the spell has, such as that of Bone Splinters.

Instant  

Exile target creature. Its controller may search his or her library for a basic land card, put that card onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle his or her library.


* If the targeted creature becomes an illegal target by the time Path to Exile would resolve, the entire spell is countered. The creature’s controller won’t search for a basic land card.
* The controller of the exiled creature isn’t required to search his or her library for a basic land. If that player doesn’t, the player won’t shuffle his or her library.

Phantasmal Image  

1U  

Creature — Illusion  

0/0  

You may have Phantasmal Image enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it’s an Illusion in addition to its other types and it gains “When this creature becomes the target of a spell or ability, sacrifice it.”


* Phantasmal Image copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below) and it gains the Illusion creature type and the triggered ability. It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* The Illusion creature type and the triggered ability that Phantasmal Image gains as part of its copy effect are both copiable values that other effects may copy.
* If the chosen creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Phantasmal Image), then Phantasmal Image enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Phantasmal Image copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Phantasmal Image is not a token in this case.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Phantasmal Image enters the battlefield. Any “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Phantasmal Image somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Phantasmal Image can’t become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that’s already on the battlefield.

Primal Command  

3GG  

Sorcery  

Choose two —  

• Target player gains 7 life.  

• Put target noncreature permanent on top of its owner’s library.  

• Target player shuffles his or her graveyard into his or her library.  

• Search your library for a creature card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.


* Primal Command’s modes are performed in the order listed. If you put a noncreature permanent on top of its owner’s library and have that player shuffle his or her graveyard into his or her library, that card is shuffled away.
* Primal Command won’t be put into your graveyard until after it’s finished resolving, which means it won’t be shuffled into your library as part of its own effect if you target yourself with its third mode.

Pyrewild Shaman  

2R  

Creature — Goblin Shaman  

3/1  
*Bloodrush* — 1R, Discard Pyrewild Shaman: Target attacking creature gets +3/+1 until end of turn.  

Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player, if Pyrewild Shaman is in your graveyard, you may pay 3. If you do, return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand.


* Pyrewild Shaman’s last ability triggers only once for each time combat damage is dealt, no matter how many creatures are dealing damage at that time.
* Pyrewild Shaman’s ability can trigger during each combat damage step. For example, if a creature with first strike deals combat damage, you can return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand and discard it using its bloodrush ability to pump up an attacking creature without first strike. Then, when that creature deals combat damage, you can return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand again.
* Pyrewild Shaman’s last ability triggers only if it’s in your graveyard when the creatures deal combat damage to a player. It returns to your hand only if it’s still in your graveyard when the ability resolves. Notably, if Pyrewild Shaman is dealt lethal damage at the same time that a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, Pyrewild Shaman’s ability won’t trigger.
* If creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at the same time (perhaps because it’s a multiplayer game), Pyrewild Shaman’s ability will trigger once for each of those players. However, only the first such ability that you pay for will return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand. Even if it’s put back into your graveyard before the other abilities resolve, it’s considered a different Pyrewild Shaman than the one whose ability triggered.

Pyromancer Ascension  

1R  

Enchantment  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has the same name as a card in your graveyard, you may put a quest counter on Pyromancer Ascension.  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell while Pyromancer Ascension has two or more quest counters on it, you may copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.


* If either of Pyromancer Ascension’s abilities triggers, it will go on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. The ability will resolve first. If it’s Pyromancer Ascension’s second ability that triggered, the copy it creates will also resolve before the original spell. The copy is created even if the original spell has been countered.
* If Pyromancer Ascension’s first ability triggers, you’ll put a quest counter on it even if the card in your graveyard leaves your graveyard by the time the ability resolves or if the spell you cast is countered.
* If you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your graveyard (due to an ability such as flashback, for example), Pyromancer Ascension’s first ability won’t trigger unless another card with the same name is in your graveyard.
* The second ability triggers only if Pyromancer Ascension already has two quest counters on it at the time you cast an instant or sorcery spell. This means a spell can’t cause the second counter to be put on Pyromancer Ascension and then become copied. It also means a player can’t remove Pyromancer Ascension in response to you casting an instant or sorcery spell in order to prevent the ability from triggering.
* Pyromancer Ascension’s second ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it’s not “cast.” Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won’t trigger.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it’s copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can’t choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell that’s copied is modal (that is, it says “Choose one —” or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode cannot be chosen.
* If the spell that’s copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Bonfire of the Damned does), the copy will have the same value of X.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fiery Justice does), the division can’t be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
* You can’t choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.

* You can choose up to four lands, no matter who controls any of them. Those lands untap once. You can’t choose one land and have it untap four times, for example.
* If the spell is an illegal target when Rewind tries to resolve, perhaps because it was countered by another spell or ability, Rewind will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won’t untap any lands.
* If Rewind resolves but the target spell can’t be countered, you’ll still untap lands.

2/2  

G: Exile target card from a graveyard. If it was a creature card, put a +1/+1 counter on Scavenging Ooze and you gain 1 life.


* If the target card is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No +1/+1 counter will be put on Scavenging Ooze and you won’t gain life. Notably, this means that if you activate Scavenging Ooze’s ability multiple times targeting the same creature card, only the first instance of the ability to resolve will have any effect.

Sacrifice Seal of Primordium: Destroy target artifact or enchantment.

Séance  

2WW  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of each upkeep, you may exile target creature card from your graveyard. If you do, create a token that’s a copy of that card, except it’s a Spirit in addition to its other types. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.


* The token doesn’t have haste (unless the card it’s copying has haste) and usually won’t be able to attack.
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else. It doesn’t copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
* The token is a Spirit in addition to its other types. This is a copiable value of the token that other effects may copy.
* The delayed triggered ability that exiles the token isn’t a characteristic of the token. If an effect such as populate copies the token, the new copy won’t be exiled.
* If the copied card has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the card copied by the token had any “when [this permanent] enters the battlefield” abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it’s created. Similarly, any “as [this permanent] enters the battlefield” or “[this permanent] enters the battlefield with” abilities that the token has copied will also work.

Flashback 5BB *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*


* Only creatures on the battlefield will be exiled. In other zones, they’re “creature cards,” not “creatures.”
* If the targeted creature is an illegal target by the time Sever the Bloodline resolves, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No creatures will be exiled.
* Unless a token is a copy of another creature or was explicitly given a name by the effect that created it, its name is the creature types it was given when it was created. For example, the Beast tokens created by Thragtusk and by Baloth Cage Trap are both named “Beast.”

You control enchanted creature.  

Discard two cards: Soul Ransom’s controller sacrifices it, then draws two cards. Only any opponent may activate this ability.


* In most cases, you’ll enchant a creature controlled by an opponent, which will cause you to gain control of that creature. Any of your opponents can activate the last ability of Soul Ransom by discarding two cards. When that ability resolves, you’ll sacrifice Soul Ransom and draw two cards.
* You’ll draw two cards even if you can’t sacrifice Soul Ransom, perhaps because it left the battlefield in response to Soul Ransom’s ability.

* If Tandem Lookout or the creature it’s paired with is dealt lethal damage at the same time that either deals damage to an opponent, its ability triggers. You’ll draw a card even though that creature no longer has the ability.

Tarmogoyf  

1G  

Creature — Lhurgoyf  

\*/1+\*  

Tarmogoyf’s power is equal to the number of card types among cards in all graveyards and its toughness is equal to that number plus 1.


* Tarmogoyf’s ability works in all zones, not just while Tarmogoyf is on the battlefield.
* Tarmogoyf counts card types, not cards. If the only card in all graveyards is a single artifact creature, Tarmogoyf will be 2/3. If the only cards in all graveyards are ten artifact creatures, Tarmogoyf will still be 2/3.
* The card types that can appear on cards in a graveyard are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Legendary and basic are supertypes, not card types.

Teleportal  

UR  

Sorcery  

Target creature you control gets +1/+0 until end of turn and can’t be blocked this turn.  

Overload 3UR *(You may cast this spell for its overload cost. If you do, change its text by replacing all instances of “target” with “each.”)*


* The set of creatures that gets +1/+0 from an overloaded Teleportal is determined as the spell resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won’t get +1/+0. However, because the second part of Teleportal’s effect doesn’t change the characteristics of any permanents, the set of creatures that can’t be blocked is constantly updated. Any creature you control at the moment blockers are chosen can’t be blocked.

Terminus  

4WW  

Sorcery  

Put all creatures on the bottom of their owners’ libraries.  

Miracle W *(You may cast this card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it’s the first card you drew this turn.)*


* Each player chooses the order that creatures he or she owns are put onto the bottom of his or her library. This order isn’t revealed to other players.

Thornscape Battlemage  

2G  

Creature — Elf Wizard  

2/2  

Kicker R and/or W *(You may pay an additional R and/or W as you cast this spell.)*  

When Thornscape Battlemage enters the battlefield, if it was kicked with its R kicker, it deals 2 damage to target creature or player.  

When Thornscape Battlemage enters the battlefield, if it was kicked with its W kicker, destroy target artifact.


* You choose whether to kick a spell as you cast it, and you pay that much along with the spell’s mana cost at the same time. Kicking a spell is always optional.
* You can pay any particular kicker cost only once. You can’t pay it multiple times to get multiples of either triggered ability.
* If Thornscape Battlemage is put onto the battlefield as the result of a spell or ability, there’s no opportunity to kick it.
* Kicker costs don’t change a spell’s mana cost or converted mana cost.

Torrent of Souls  

4B/R  

Sorcery  

Return up to one target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield if B was spent to cast Torrent of Souls. Creatures target player controls get +2/+0 and gain haste until end of turn if R was spent to cast Torrent of Souls. *(Do both if BR was spent.)*


* Torrent of Souls cares about what mana was spent to pay its total cost, not just what mana was spent to pay the hybrid mana symbol in its cost.
* Torrent of Souls checks on resolution to see if any black mana or any red mana was spent to pay its cost. It doesn’t matter how much mana of either color was spent; the effects won’t be multiplied.
* If Torrent of Souls is copied, the copy will not have had any colors of mana paid for it, no matter what colors were spent on the original spell. The copy won’t have any effect as it resolves.

Ulvenwald Tracker  

G  

Creature — Human Shaman  

1/1  

1G, T: Target creature you control fights another target creature.


* The second target of Ulvenwald Tracker’s ability can be another creature you control, but it can’t be the same creature as the first target.
* If either target of Ulvenwald Tracker’s ability is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage.

Unflinching Courage  

1GW  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has trample and lifelink.


* Multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant.

Urban Evolution  

3GU  

Sorcery  

Draw three cards. You may play an additional land this turn.


* Urban Evolution’s effect allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands. In particular, you don’t get to play a land as Urban Evolution resolves; Urban Evolution fully resolves first and draws three cards, perhaps including a land you’ll play later.
* The effects of multiple Urban Evolutions in the same turn are cumulative. They’re also cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from Explore.
* If you somehow manage to cast Urban Evolution when it’s not your turn, you’ll draw three cards when it resolves, but you won’t be able to play a land that turn.

Vanish into Memory  

2WU  

Instant  

Exile target creature. You draw cards equal to that creature’s power. At the beginning of your next upkeep, return that card to the battlefield under its owner’s control. If you do, discard cards equal to that creature’s toughness.


* Vanish into Memory cares about the creature’s power just before it left the battlefield and its toughness just after it returns to the battlefield. For example, if you target a 2/2 creature with two +1/+1 counters on it, you’ll draw four cards, then when it returns to the battlefield without any counters on it, you’ll discard two cards.
* If the creature exiled with Vanish into Memory never returns to the battlefield (because it was a token creature, for example), you don’t discard any cards.
* If the creature exiled with Vanish into Memory isn’t a creature card (for example, a crewed Vehicle), that card will still be returned to the battlefield, but not as a creature. Since the card returned to the battlefield has no toughness, you discard no cards.

Venser, Shaper Savant  

2UU  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

Flash  

When Venser, Shaper Savant enters the battlefield, return target spell or permanent to its owner’s hand.


* If Venser’s triggered ability targets a spell cast with flashback, that spell will be exiled instead of returning to its owner’s hand.
* If a spell is returned to its owner’s hand, it’s removed from the stack and thus will not resolve. The spell isn’t countered; it just no longer exists. This works against a spell that can’t be countered.
* If a copy of a spell is returned to its owner’s hand, it’s moved there, then it will cease to exist as a state-based action. It can’t be recast.

Voice of Resurgence  

GW  

Creature — Elemental  

2/2  

Whenever an opponent casts a spell during your turn or when Voice of Resurgence dies, create a green and white Elemental creature token with “This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of creatures you control.”


* If Voice of Resurgence’s ability triggers because an opponent cast a spell during your turn, the token will be created before that spell resolves.
* The power and toughness of the token change as the number of creatures you control changes. The token’s ability counts itself, so it’ll be at least 1/1.
* Copies of the token will also have the ability that defines its power and toughness.

Wayfaring Temple  

1GW  

Creature — Elemental  

\*/\*  

Wayfaring Temple’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of creatures you control.  

Whenever Wayfaring Temple deals combat damage to a player, populate. *(Create a token that’s a copy of a creature token you control.)*


* The ability that defines Wayfaring Temple’s power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield.
* As long as Wayfaring Temple is on the battlefield, its first ability will count itself, so it’ll be at least 1/1.

Wort, the Raidmother  

4R/GR/G  

Legendary Creature — Goblin Shaman  

3/3  

When Wort, the Raidmother enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 red and green Goblin Warrior creature tokens.  

Each red or green instant or sorcery spell you cast has conspire. *(As you cast the spell, you may tap two untapped creatures you control that share a color with it. When you do, copy it and you may choose new targets for the copy.)*


* If a spell gains a second instance of conspire from Wort’s ability, you may choose to pay for one, both, or none of those abilities. Each conspire ability triggers only if you tap two creatures specifically for that ability.
* If the spell that’s copied is modal (that is, it says “Choose one —” or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can’t be chosen.
* If the spell that’s copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Bonfire of the Damned does), the copy will have the same value of X.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (like Fiery Justice does), the division can’t be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
* Some spells instruct you to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast that spell. If you sacrifice Wort to pay that cost, that spell won’t have conspire at the moment it becomes cast, so conspire won’t trigger, even if you tapped two creatures.
* If you’re casting a spell for its flashback cost, you can’t pay another alternative cost (such as an overload cost or a Trap’s alternative cost) instead. You may pay additional costs, such as conspire.

Zur the Enchanter  

1WUB  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

1/4  

Flying  

Whenever Zur the Enchanter attacks, you may search your library for an enchantment card with converted mana cost 3 or less and put it onto the battlefield. If you do, shuffle your library.


* An Aura put onto the battlefield without being cast doesn’t target anything, so it could be attached to a permanent with shroud or hexproof. However, the Aura’s enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to.
