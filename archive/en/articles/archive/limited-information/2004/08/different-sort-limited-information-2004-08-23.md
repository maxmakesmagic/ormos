Scott Wills is still not feeling quite up to snuff after his injury, so he’s going to take another week off to help get healthy. In the meantime, please enjoy this special art sneak preview of a creature from *Champions of Kamigawa* I guarantee you’ll be seeing on plenty of “first pick” drafting lists. This one’s special in **Magic’s** history, but you’ll have to wait to find out why. Next week begins our official card previews of *Champions*! In the meantime, Scott, we all hope you’re feeling better very soon.
