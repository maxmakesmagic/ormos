Late last month, Mariah Pagliocco—a Seattle-area *Magic* player—was struck by a car while walking home from school.

At the [StarCityGames Invitational](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/130614_columbus.html), Ben Friedman declared that he was playing for Mariah and would donate all of his winnings from the tournament to her cause.


Fueled by Mariah's love of Pandas, Ben played a white-black deck to a 2nd-place finish, and a hefty donation toward Mariah's recovery.


This deck relies on the same [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)–[Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)–[Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) backbone that Mono-Black Devotion decks are built on. The major difference is the addition of a healthy amount of white cards to supplement the black disruption. [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) is capable of taking out enchantments that would otherwise be difficult for Mono-Black to remove, while [Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council), and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), provide additional threats capable of winning the game without other help. One of the primary strengths of black-based midrange decks is that the threats are capable of winning games on their own and must be answered, card for card. Adding white strengthens this aspect of the deck.
