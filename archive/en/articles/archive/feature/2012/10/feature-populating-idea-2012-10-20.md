Drafting Selesnya sounds easy, right? Surely you draft creatures, big creatures, with teeth! And you put them on the battlefield, right? You line 'em up next to each other, and you turn 'em sideways repeatedly, until your opponent is nought but a greasy stain on the floor.


It certainly sounds simple, but that's not really how it works out. Firstly, you start seeing the word "populate" on a bunch of the cards you're drafting, so you start giggling to yourself as you imagine the shenanigans that will ensue as more and more creatures appear randomly on your side of the table with tiny comical popping noises, but by the time the draft's over, you realize you haven't actually grabbed any token making cards, and instead just a bunch of cards that populate.


Looking through the Selesnya cards that make token creatures in *Return to Ravnica*, it looks like you should be golden, but a surprising number of them are uncommon, or even rare. While some populate cards are very tempting, like [Trostani's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani%27s+Judgment), you'll need to prioritize picking up some of the more innocuous looking token making cards, like [Eyes in the Skies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyes+in+the+Skies), and most importantly, [Centaur's Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur%27s+Herald) and [Knightly Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knightly+Valor). [Coursers' Accord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coursers%27+Accord) will do, in a pinch, but ideally, you want the Herald getting your population started as soon as possible.

From there, you obviously want to get a bunch of [Centaur Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Healer)s and [Towering Indrik](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Towering+Indrik)s to help hold off the Rakdos and Azorius hordes, [Sunspire Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunspire+Griffin) to evade defences, and [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), [Swift Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Justice), and [Common Bond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Bond) to help settle any mid-field disputes. [Keening Apparition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keening+Apparition) is very useful as a "bear" that provides an excellent answer to [Stab Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stab+Wound), and [Ethereal Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Armor) is surprisingly effective at giving your Centaurs just enough power to break through Door Keepers and [Lobber Crew](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobber+Crew)s, and if you've managed to pick up enough [Knightly Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knightly+Valor)s, creating absurdly large and unbeatable monsters.


In short, if you skimp on your token makers, you're going to have a bad time. Once you get 'em, get a-populatin', and get in there!
