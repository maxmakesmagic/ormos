Here in the United States, we've got this thing called "Thanksgiving," where we give thanks. Also we take a four-day weekend and eat a lot. You can probably get more information from the Internet. The point is that **Magic Online** is having a special event from Thursday, November 22, through Sunday, November 25! And if you use the beta, we need your feedback! [Let us know what you think](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1079500/MTGO-Wide-Beta-Survey-November-6-2012).


### *Masters Edition* Block Sealed


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1108_boosters.jpg)*Masters Edition* isn't really a block. But we do have four *Masters Edition* sets, so why not pretend? Each player in the Sealed Deck queue will get one booster of each of the four *Masters Edition* sets and make a thirty-card deck. The queues are Swiss, which means you'll get to play all three rounds even if you lose!


### *Masters Edition* Premier Drafts


These are scheduled 64-player events, starting at 12:00 AM PST (midnight) on Thursday, November 22, with *Masters Edition* Draft, with a new one every hour, cycling through the *Masters Edition* sets. Here's the schedule:
