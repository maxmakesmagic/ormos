It's midnight on Friday. The GP you've been practicing for the last two months is in the morning. You are in the top 4, and if you make it to the top 2, you can be looking at more than $100 in cash. If you don't make it, you're gonna get 3 packs of Apocalypse. What are you going to do? Well, if you are a bunch of sensible, friendly women, you're going to split the $200 four ways and go home and get some sleep for the GP tomorrow.


That's what happened at the Women's Open Friday at GP Denver -- doubt you'll see that too often. The top 4 finalists are as follows (all local Denverites):

2. Caroline Kert with mono-red burn
3. Megan Hoess with Fires
4. Mary Van Tyne with U/W/R Wild Research

I could almost give you a rundown of what the finals would have been, since Laura and Mary already played each other and Caroline and Megan already played each other as well:


* Mary would've lost to Laura's lock-down
* Megan's critters wouldn't have lasted long enough to get through the speedy burns in Caroline's deck
* Laura and Caroline, having drawn to get into the top spots in the top 4, would've drawn and both gone home happy $100 richer.

But splitting the money with the others was just a bunch more fun.
