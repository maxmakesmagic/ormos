The Standard metagame featuring *Khans of Tarkir* has continued to develop after the [Pro Tour](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk), as [Grand Prix Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpla14) made clear. While Jeskai and Abzan were the clans to watch out for at the Pro Tour two weeks ago, LA was a different matter. Abzan made a sizable appearance, but so did Mardu, and the final match of the main event featured Mono-Red Aggro against the classic Red-Green Monsters archetype.


Meanwhile, the Pro Tour Qualifier season feeding Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* continued. We've got some more Top 8 Draft decklists featuring the new set for your viewing pleasure.
