If a major theme of this tournament is the emergence of the new generation of American Magic players, this match is a great example of the old guard against the new. Mitch Tamblyn has been on a roll lately, coming in the Top 16 of Pro Tour San Diego, and Top 8 at Grand Prix Oakland. His opponent, Dave Humpherys, needs no introduction. Worlds, Pro Tours, Team Pro Tours, Grand Prix tournaments- you name it, he's put up top finishes there. He has yet to be on a National team however, and is looking to change that this weekend. Both players came into this round with perfect 5-0 records, and are on their way to securing a seat for Sunday.


### Game 1


Tamblyn mulliganed down to six. He had a second turn [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), and Humpherys played [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer). The Skyhunter attacked for two, and [Night's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night%27s+Whisper) provided some more cards. [Grafted Wargear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Wargear) made Humpherys' Engineer a solid beater, and Tamblyn increased the pressure with [Arcbound Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Hybrid). Humpherys played [Talon of Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talon+of+Pain) and dealt four more with his Engineer. Tamblyn attacked for four again with his team, and used [Stasis Cocoon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Cocoon) to deal with the Talon. [Thought Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Courier) gave Humpherys a little more card economy, but the game was all about tempo and racing at this point. Tamblyn played a [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem), and just attacked with his Skyhunter. [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) destroyed his Golem, and Humpherys activated his Courier. The Engineer wasn't blocked, and [Baton of Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baton+of+Courage) provided the final points to push through lethal damage.


Tamblyn- 0 Humpherys- 1


### Game 2


![Mitch Tamblyn](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat04/fm6_2.jpg)Tamblyn played [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves), and once more Humpherys had a second turn Engineer. [Suntouched Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suntouched+Myr) gave Tamblyn a 2/2 body, and it attacked right away thanks to the Greaves. [Echoing Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin) destroyed the equipment, and Humpherys played [Grafted Wargear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Wargear). Tamblyn played [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem), and attacked for two with the Myr. Humpherys played [Auriok Siege Sled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Siege+Sled), and made it into an absolute monster thanks to the Wargear. All Tamblyn could do was play [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) along with [Leonin Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Squire), and end his turn. The Myr and Golem were forced to jump in front of the Sled and die, and Humpherys added a [Goblin Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Brawler) to his side. Tamblyn summoned [Leonin Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage), and the Myr was next to die to the Sled. [Talon of Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talon+of+Pain) made things look even better for Humpherys, and Tamblyn's Squire got through for three. [Icy Manipulator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator) followed, and now Tamblyn had a much needed answer to Humpherys' Sled. The Squire got through for three more, and Tamblyn made things look even better with a [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter). Things shifted right back, when Humpherys cast [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) on end step. This freed up his Siege Sled, and it got through for six damage. [Sundering Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) followed, and Tamblyn couldn't recover.


Humpherys- 2 Tamblyn- 0
