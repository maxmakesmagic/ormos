Louisiana native, Tom "The Boss" Ross, got his first taste of Pro Tour success many years ago. Since then, Ross has quietly exited the limelight. Over the last year, though, Ross has established himself as one of the most impressive players on the StarCityGames Open Series. Ross plays unique decks of his own design that require incredible playskill. Ross's ability to win with seemingly unplayable decks makes him one of the most exciting players to watch in high profile events. This weekend, he has the opportunity to prove himself on Legacy's biggest stage here at Grand Prix New Jersey. 



 I had the opportunity to sit down with The Boss to discuss his perspective on the current Legacy format, improving as a player, and *Magic* in general.
