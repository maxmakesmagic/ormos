Vincent Lemoine was the more experienced player in this semifinals, with Top 8s at Grand Prix Athens 2006 and Pro Tour Paris 2011 to his name. His opponent, Damien Bouillot, was playing in his first Grand Prix Top 8.


Judging by the decks that they drafted, the two players had different perspectives on the Limited format. Bouilot avoided green and assembled a good version of what many consider to be one of the best archetypes in *Battle for Zendikar* Limited: Blue/Black Ingest. His best opening would be [Culling Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Drone) into [Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler).


Lemoine, on the other side of the table, went against the common wisdom. While most players tried to avoid green, Lemoine actually liked the color and drafted a green converge deck with [Prism Array](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Array), [Tajuru Stalwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Stalwart), [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence), [Roilmage's Trick](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roilmage%27s+Trick), and [Skyrider Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyrider+Elf). He had two [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) for fixing along with a remarkable toolbox of eight different nonbasic lands, many of which feature enters-the-battlefield triggers.


The Games
=========


Both players had a fast start with 2-drops and 3-drops: [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid) and [Tajuru Warcaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Warcaller) on Lemoine's side of the board, against [Culling Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Drone) and [Dominator Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dominator+Drone) on Bouillot's side.


The turning point was [Murk Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murk+Strider). It allowed Bouillot to add a relevant threat to the board while taking out the biggest blocker on Lemoine's side, all in the same turn. Lemoine still had a bunch of sweet cards like [Prism Array](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prism+Array), [Roilmage's Trick](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roilmage%27s+Trick), and [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence) in his hand, which would have been great if the game went long, but he could only play one card per turn and found himself too far behind on tempo.

In the subsequent turns, Bouillot kept matching Lemoine's plays one-for-one and rode his early board advantage to victory.


**Damien Bouillot 1 - Vincent Lemoine 0**


Early on, it looked as if this game might turn into a damage race that would favor Bouillot, who took to the air with [Malakir Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malakir+Familiar) and [Cloud Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Manta).


But an [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence) from Lemoine (cast off of his motley assortment of lands including [Lumbering Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumbering+Falls), [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista), and [Fertile Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Thicket)) swung the game hugely in his favor as he took control of [Cloud Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Manta). This way, he not only took out an important attacker, but also gained a way to trade with [Malakir Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malakir+Familiar).


Bouillot's draw just didn't come together in this game, as evidenced by a non-processed [Mind Raker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Raker) and a [Tide Drifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tide+Drifter) that didn't do much to improve his board state. Ultimately, Lemoine's more powerful cards took over the game: he set up the one-two punch of [Rush of Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Ice) plus [Sheer Drop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheer+Drop) to destroy an opposing blocker, leaving himself with two extra 3/3 attackers, and swung in for lethal.

Bouillot didn't have a fast start, as he only added two [Culling Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Drone)s and a [Coralhelm Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coralhelm+Guide) to his board over the course of the first five turns. Lemoine, in the meantime, had played [Blisterpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blisterpod), [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid), two [Call the Scions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Scions), and [Oran-Rief Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oran-Rief+Invoker).

So it looked like we were in for an unusual game of *Battle for Zendikar* Limited in which the only creatures on the battlefield were 1/1s, 2/1s, or 2/2s, especially after Lemoine's plans of eventually playing [Eldrazi Devastator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Devastator) were foiled by [Mire's Malice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire%27s+Malice).


We were now in topdeck mode. Lemoine's deck coughed up [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying), to the hilarity of the Belgian crowd, who had been very much amused by Lemoine's unusual land toolbox. Looking through his deck, he found [Lumbering Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumbering+Falls), which admittedly wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough to change the tide of the game.


The most important card on Bouillot's side of the board, as it turned out, was [Coralhelm Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coralhelm+Guide). It first made [Culling Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Drone) unblockable to enable the processor ability on [Wasteland Strangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Strangler). It then pushed his creatures past the [Lumbering Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumbering+Falls). And eventually it was sacrificed to [Smothering Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smothering+Abomination) for value. Several turns later, Bouillot attacked for lethal.
