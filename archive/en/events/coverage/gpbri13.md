Justin Robb Triumphant in Brisbane
==================================




October 4-6, 2013












Grand Prix Brisbane 2013
------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpbri13/winner.jpg)*L**ocal Hero Justin Robb came to Grand Prix Brisbane a relative unknown with an epic journey ahead of him\*.*


(\*cue epic montage music.)


But like any great Hero worth his salt, it was a journey he'd prepared for. Discovering **Magic** with *New Phyrexia*, Robb was hooked. He scoured the internet, devouring videos of people streaming **Magic**: Online and the live video coverage of Grand Prix events, Pro Tours, and Open Events alike, all the while honing his skills in the local Brisbane **Magic** scene.


In practicing for this event, he developed an Affinity for the Artifact Aggro deck, and undeterred by his lack of byes, rode it Heroically through the field to the Top 8. There he faced and defeated such legendary Australian **Magic** foes as Dan Unwin and Justin "Juzza" Cheung to become the Grand Prix Brisbane Champion!


The Naiads shall sing of this [Fabled Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) for generations.


And now, an even bigger quest. Along with Unwin, Cheung, and Ben Tudman, together, they will journey to Valencia, Spain in 2014, to compete at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*.
