Sung-Wook gave Webster his only loss in the Swiss, adding a hint of dramatic foreshadowing to the match. Would this be a repeat of earlier in the weekend, or would Webster find reserves of skill and luck to power through the difficult matchup?


Sung-Wook had a trio of early [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, gaining valuable tempo by summoning the eponymous vermin from his hand rather than needing to discard cards to make copies. Webster got off to a relatively speedy start also, with a [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), Xenagos, [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and a [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon).

Unfortunately, the rats were a mite too fast for Webster's army to be able to contain, as he was forced to chump-block to stay alive and conceded shortly after. Brow furrowed, he consulted some sideboarding notes and shuffled up for the next game.


 **Nam Sung-Wook 1 - Ash Webster 0** Sung-Wook tried an early [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, but this one got shot down by [Dreadbore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbore). He followed up with a [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie), stripping Webster of a vital [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and leaving him with a [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) and a [Garruk, Caller of Beasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Caller+of+Beasts) in hand.

Webster dropped the [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade), but Sung-Wook had a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) for the Garruk and a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) to put Webster on a tight clock. A [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) finished things off a turn later, sending Nam Sung-Wook onto the finals after a blisteringly fast match.
