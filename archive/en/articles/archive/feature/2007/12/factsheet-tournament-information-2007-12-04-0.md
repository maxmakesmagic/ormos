The Madrid-Barajas airport is located within Madrid's transportation core zone, the A zone, and is conveniently served by the metro and local buses. A one way metro ticket from the airport costs €2 (€1 additional airport surcharge included), and will take you anywhere within the A zone. Alternatively, you could buy a tourist pass, which also includes the airport surcharge. To get to the site, take line 8 to Nuevos Ministerios, and then change to L10, to Lago.  
  
**ARRIVING BY TRAIN**  

Most of the trains arrive at the Atocha station. From there, you can take the metro or bus 36 (stop Pº Extremadura- Albéniz) to get to the venue. The site is accessible from the metro stations Lago (L10) and Alto de Extremadura (L6). If arriving at the Chamartín station, you can take metro line 10 directly from there.  
  
**ARRIVING BY CAR**  

Madrid is at the center of all major roads in Spain. Motorways A1 to A6 will take you straight to Madrid.
