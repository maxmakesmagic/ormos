Here's a bite-sized look at how the remaining three Quarterfinal matches went.



 Yuuki Akaboshi (Green-Red Tron) vs. Ken Sawada (Scapeshift)




 As expected, the first game went to Sawada. When Akaboshi failed to assemble an early Tron, he couldn't bring enough pressure to bear to stop Sawada building to a lethal [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift).




**Sawada 1 - Akaboshi 0**
