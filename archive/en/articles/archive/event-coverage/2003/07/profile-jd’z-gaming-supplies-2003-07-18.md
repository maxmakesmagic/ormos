Located in Schenectady, NY (that’s pronounced “Skenektady” and located near Albany), JD’z Gaming Supplies is an unexpected victor at this year’s North East Challenge. Battling alongside brand names like Your Move Games and TOGIT, this tiny store was the most successful of the bunch, seeing four of its regulars in top 8, and one more in top 16.


Adam Chambers, the NEC 2003 Champion, qualified in Lenox Sports Cards, but he sites JD’z as his home store, alongside finalist Anthony Ramasami and top 8 finishers Joe Snyder and Jason Bernard. JD’z is a very small store that nevertheless has a very active Magic population of about 12-15 regulars. “All we do is play Magic,” says Snyder. “We are not much for Constructed, we just draft all the time.”


Occasionally the regulars stay at the store as late as 5-6 in the morning drafting, while owner Jason D. Pasqualy pulls an all-nigher on his favorite computer game Asheron’s Call.


So what is the secret of JD’z crew’s success? “We all get along really well, but we are also intensely competitive against each other. Wanting to win so badly makes all of us play better. It’s hard to win at the store because there are so many good players.“
