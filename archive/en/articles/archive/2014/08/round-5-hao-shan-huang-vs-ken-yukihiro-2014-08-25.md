Hao-Shan is one of the APAC region's most recognisable players, consistently posting exceptional results as both a player and as a member of the eminent MTGMintcard team. Ken Yukuhiro's reputation as a deck designer and one of **Magic**'s sharpest brewers is well deserved, his creations raising eyebrows and winning matches left, right and centre. Huang brought a powerful Esper deck to the table, but Yukuhiro's U/B Heroic deck outmanoeuvred its way through the control matchup, highlighting one of the advantages of bringing an unknown quantity into an established metagame.


**Game 1**


Huang led off with a scry land, while Yukuhiro opened with a [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave) and a [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero). The Hero got pinged with an [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm), stemming his offensive ever-so-briefly. Yukuhiro simply summoned a second Hero.


Huang's [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) showed a hand of [Xathrid Necromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Necromancer), Agent of Fates, [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) and a [Boon of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Erebos), the first hint that this wasn't a variant on Mono-Black Aggro. Huang nabbed the Necromancer and passed with a sigh and a shake of his head, clearly not liking the look of the next few turns.


Yukuhiro summoned the Agent of Fates and attacked with his Hero, threatening all manner of heroic triggers on his following turn. Huang waited until Yukuhiro animated and attacked with a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) to [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) it, but Yukuhiro kept his land hanging around with his [Boon of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Erebos). Huang had a [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) for the Agent of Fates, but looked to be falling behind.

*Ken 'Heroic' Yukuhiro, Level 17 Shenaniganist* 

Yukuhiro attacked, then summoned a [Pain Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer) and a [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) to power out a [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero) (and give himself a draw off the Seer, thus living the dream of idealist deckbuilders since the cards were spoiled). Huang summoned a [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and shrunk Yukuhiro's creatures. Yukuhiro used a [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix) to deal some more damage to Huang, then attacked him down to a precarious 1 life. When the [Pain Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer) flipped a [Boon of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Erebos) off the top of Yukuhiro's library, Huang scooped up his cards and headed for the sideboard.

**Game 2**


Yukhiro started things off with [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero). His follow-up [Xathrid Necromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Necromancer) got [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve)d, and [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero) took his [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) fairly shortly thereafter. Yukuhiro powered up with a [Pain Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer) and dropped a [Hidden Strings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Strings) on it. Huang tried to off it with a [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath), and when that got countered, a [Dark Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Betrayal), but Yukuhiro had a [Mizzium Skin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Skin) to keep the [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant)-wannabe around for another untap step.

Yukuhiro added to the pressure with an Agent of Fates. Huang, having enough of this nonsense, unloaded a pair of [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)s to clear the board, then followed up with an [Ã†therling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) and a [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa). Yukuhiro shrugged and shuffled up his cards.



**Hao-Shan Huang 1 - Ken Yukuhiro 1**


**Game 3**


Huang mulliganed to 5 for the decider and Yukuhiro opened with his now-eponymous [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero). He followed with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), showing Blood Baron, Elspeth, Supreme Judgment and 2 lands in Huang's hand - not bad for a 5-card starter. He took the Judgment, Huang simply laying lands and passing. A [Xathrid Necromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Necromancer) helped drop Huang to 12 before Yukuhiro summoned an [Artisan of Forms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan+of+Forms).


Huang had his 4th land for the Blood Baron, but was forced to have it come into play tapped. On a somewhat perilous life total, Huang pondered his options before pointing a [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) at the [Artisan of Forms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan+of+Forms). Yukuhiro attacked with both his creatures before summoning a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), obviating Huang's unsummoned Blood Baron, which Huang was obliged to cast regardless.


Yukuhiro cast a [Hidden Strings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Strings), tapping the Blood Baron and triggering Heroic from his [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero). The tapped Baron stopped the Demon for a turn, but Huang couldn't find any answers, Yukuhiro's innovative U/B concoction taking the match.
