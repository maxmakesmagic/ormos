*Wizards of the Coast is in the process of moving to a new building and will return with new articles beginning Monday, October 24th. In the meantime, we hope you'll enjoy this informal week of previously run content relating to* Mirage*, in preparation for that popular set's upcoming release on* **Magic** Online*. Have a great week, and we'll be back to see you on Monday.*

Today's **Magic** Arcana takes a trip in the way-back machine to the *Mirage* era of the color black. How many black cards can you name from their rules text alone? To make it a bit more challenging, we'll only provide you with the text boxes from the cards' *playtest* versions, so their wording may not represent exactly what ended up on the card. (To protect the cards' anonymity, any references to the card itself have been blurred out.) Happy guessing! (You may want to keep this [*Mirage* spoiler list](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/generic/cardlists/Mirage.txt) handy!)


*(Click each picture below to reveal the name of the card. If you have questions, ask at the [Magic message boards](http://boards1.wizards.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=144).)*
