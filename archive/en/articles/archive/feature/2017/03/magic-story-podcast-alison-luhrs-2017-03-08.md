Magic Story Podcast: Alison Luhrs
=================================



 Posted in **Feature**

By Blake Rasmussen




Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






This week, we're on episode four of six of the *Magic* Story Podcast, and we're joined by Alison Luhrs: community manager, storyteller extraordinaire, and creator of Yahenni. She's here to talk about story writing and Yahenni, as well as to answer a bunch of random fan questions about anything and everything—including the burning question of which character Alison would abandon to the Phyrexians if she had the choice.


The *Magic* Story Podcast goes behind the scenes with the people who make the worlds, create the characters, and infuse this game with imagination. We have two more episodes left before the return of *Magic* Story when *Amonkhet* season kicks off March 29!
