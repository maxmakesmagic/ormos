With *Magic 2015* now in the wild, players are beginning to explore the different combinations and deck strategies that the new cards provide. We'll see this more extensively during Pro Tour *Magic 2015*, starting next Friday.



Until then, Modern continues on as players battle for their invitations to Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*. You can take your first big step toward getting to the big event by locating a [Pro Tour Qualifier](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/qualifierlist#huey) near you.



*Magic Online* players will have their chance at building with the new cards very soon as well. [*Magic 2015* Prereleases are happening now on *Magic Online*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-2015-core-set-Prerelease-and-release-events-2014%E2%80%9306-30)! We'll see what our online competitors are drawn to in Daily Event and Premier Event decklists starting next week, but for now, refresh yourself with what the formats look like going before the new set sees its appearance in Constructed events by checking out this week's winning decks.
