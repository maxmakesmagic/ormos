We covered a little of the story behind Olle R책de's [Sylvan Safekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Safekeeper) in a [previous Arcana](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/113). But how do the artists paint the pictures of the players? Do they have them sit in a studio?


No, they use reference photos. Artist Pete Venters was kind enough to pass on his reference photo of R책de, shown below.


Here's what Pete had to say:


"This head shot was used because it was one of the clearest I could find. The oId hair style was transplanted on because R&D wanted the portrait to represent how Olle looks when he won the right to make the card [before he went into the army].


"For the final piece I also adjusted where he was looking and gave him a knowing kind of smile to show he was in control of things."
