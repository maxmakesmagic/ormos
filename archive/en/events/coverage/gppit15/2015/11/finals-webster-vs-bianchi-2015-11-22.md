A pair of Grand Prix Top 8 first-timers entered the final match of Grand Prix Pittsburgh. Aaron Webster, a 23-year-old Syracuse native had torn through the tournament and even dispatched 25th-ranked Craig Wescoe in the semifinals, while Alex Bianchi had taken a unique twist on a classic deck and had scraped out Game 3s in both the quarter and semifinals.


One of them would leave a Grand Prix champion.


**The Decks**


Bianchi’s deck was what has become the Modern standby: [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), though with a unique twist. He was playing the classic combo with [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) and [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), but rather than the strict blue-red shell most players used, Bianchi arrived with a Jeskai twist on the archetype. The white mana gave him access to [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) as removal and [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) as a way to build late-game pressure. Unlike many modern-day Twin decks, Bianchi also opted to go all-in on the combo, shaving down to just one [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to include copies of [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) and [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker).


Across from him sat his second-straight Affinity opponent. This time it was Aaron Webster, who had navigated the familiar aggro deck through a field of combo all weekend long. Affinity may seem like a straightforward deck, but it’s notoriously difficult to play optimally. Webster, an old hand with the robots, played well all weekend and now had a chance to add a Grand Prix title with one more win.

*Aaron Webster had brought his favorite deck all the way to the finals of Grand Prix Pittsburgh, and now had a chance to end the tournament with a title.*


**The Games**


It was an overly explosive start, but [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) allowed Webster to power out [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) on the second turn and send a second to join it on the next one. It wasn’t a ton of power, but it was resilient power, and quickly began to take chunks out of Bianche’s life total. With removing the Champions impossible and racing impractical, Bianchi was all-in on his combo.


His deck cooperated, giving him [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) on the third turn with the ability to follow up with [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). But a timely [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) from Webster nixed that plan and ended the first game in a hurry.


Webster had a slow start again in the second game, though he made sure Bianchi did as well thanks to a pair of [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). The discard spells left Bianchi with two [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)s but no way to use them.


The only problem was that Webster had no pressure to back them up, and [Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence) slowed him even further. A steady stream of [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) followed as Bianchi searched for a way to win, but even with the additional draws he was unable to find a fourth land to unlock the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)s in his hand. What he did find was removal, and he systematically mowed down every creature Webster could muster. [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) threatened to finish what the Memnite and [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) had started, but [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) gave Bianchi the upper hand in the race, forcing the [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) to stay back on defense. A [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and another [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to flashback the Bolt was enough to end things a turn later.

*Alex Bianchi had played all three of his Top 8 matches to the final game, and the final was no exception.*


That sent the pair into the deciding game with the Grand Prix on the line. It was a slow start on both sides, as Bianchi’s [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) was answered only by a Turn 2 [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), which was sent on a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) when [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) followed it up. Without the Ravager in play, the Champion found itself in a position seldom seen: lacking Metalcraft.


Bianchi took full advantage, taking it down with [Wear & Tear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%2F%2F+Tear), though a second followed along with an [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) to provide the needed Metalcraft.


Searching for a way to win the game, Bianchi began to take hits from Webster’s army, with three [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) upping the Poison count while [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) worked on Bianchi’s life total. [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) bought a turn from one of the Inkmoths, and a follow-up [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) did the same while also threatening to stop the air force in its tracks. That prompted Webster to pull the trigger on the [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) he had been saving all game, opting to try and remove the Angel rather than save it for a possible combo.


It was a calculated risk, but one that was rendered irrelevant by [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). With the Angel now holding off the attacks, it became a race: would Bianchi find a [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) before Webster’s [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) finished things off?


The next draw step yielded no answer, just another [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) as the tension grew.


“Do you have it?” Webster asked anxiously as Bianchi peeked at his top two cards.


The answer was silent, but effective all the same: Bianchi flipped [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) and a second [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) to draw it.


“Great games,” Webster said as conceded the match and and officially sent Bianche to the title in his first Grand Prix Top 8 appearance.
