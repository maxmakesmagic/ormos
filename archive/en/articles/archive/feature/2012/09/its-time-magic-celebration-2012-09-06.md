Players new and old, around the world, will join together this weekend in an event that provides you with products and has no charge. **Magic** Celebration has become an annual event; this is the third year in a row to allow players to gather together and share in the joy of **Magic**.

The **Magic** Celebration is all about a no-charge event that puts players in a Mini-Master tournament. If you've never played in a Mini-Master event, don't worry, I'll explain it all in just a moment. But consider this: you're able to get at least one ***Magic** 2013* booster pack and possibly as many as four booster packs.

### How to Play Mini-Master

Take the booster pack you're given when you join the event and, without looking at the contents, remove the land and the token card. Then add in three of each basic land. Then shuffle up and play a game of **Magic** just like normal. That's it! 

Each time you win a match, you'll get a booster pack to add to your deck. Once you add your second booster pack, your deck-construction rules revert to the normal rules for Limited decks, which means you can modify your deck contents and add more lands as desired, so long as your deck is at least forty cards.

### Be Kind to the Newbies

The **Magic** Celebration is one of the major events for players who discover **Magic** through **Duels of the Planeswalkers**. So as you go into this event, remember that there will likely be new faces and people who are still entering the world of **Magic**. Remember to take the Celebration as an opportunity to have fun, teach new players, and welcome them into this amazing community!

### Why You Want to Play

Here are two reasons you want to call your store and sign up for this weekend's **Magic** Celebration:




1. **Free cards:** Who doesn't love free cards?
2. **It's a casually competitive event:** I know, I know, nice oxymoronâ€”but it really is. It's a tournament, so you want to play hard, but Mini-Master has high variance due to it being reliant on the contents of a single booster (at least initially). So a Pro Tour Champion battles on the same footing as the newly converted player making it to his or her first **Magic** event.

**Where do You Play?**

Well, you get to play at your local store. Check the store locator to find out if your local store is participating (it probably is). Here's how you find it on the store locator:




1. Enter your address or zip code in the search field below
