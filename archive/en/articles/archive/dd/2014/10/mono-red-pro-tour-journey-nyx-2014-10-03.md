Throughout the years, no matter how many changes occur in the environment, there has been one archetype that has persisted in Standard: the fast red deck. Sometimes it's beatdown, sometimes it's burn, but it has survived in one form or another even as more expansion-dependent archetypes disappear like summer mayflies.




Naturally, this deck was present in the [*Theros* block](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptjou14), and with *Magic 2015* it gets two strong boosts in the form of [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). With *Khans of Tarkir* thrown in the mix, it picks up [War-Name Aspirant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Name+Aspirant) and [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker).




While the mono-red deck loses some choice elements with the rotation, it likely more than makes up for it with new additions, and it would be a foolish bet to think that there's a chance it will disappear. It will surviveâ€”the question is what form will it take in the new metagame.
