 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






Hi there, everybody! I am Nate Price, the community manager for *Magic: The Gathering Arena*. You may have seen me clicking through my turn while paying attention to Twitch chat during our weekly *MTG Arena* gameplay streams.


Anyway.


I absolutely love watching people play games. I got started working with Wizards as a member of the event coverage team over a decade ago. I have had the pleasure of watching the best players in the world prove how aggressively medium I am at *Magic* on a daily basis. Even when I'm not doing that, I am avidly consuming some other form of gaming content. I literally have a monitor on my desk that is only there for me to have a rotating cast of streamers on at all times.


I love this stuff.


And that's why I couldn't be happier to announce that we are finally going to be letting people start creating content for *MTG Arena* starting the evening of March 22. The game will go into downtime the morning of March 22 and will go back up with the next major update that evening (all times Pacific).


NDA Drop â€“ Evening of March 22
==============================


I have been working toward this day since before we announced *MTG Arena* to the world. Dropping an NDA is simple. Getting ready for that, however, is a different beast.


First, we wanted to make sure that the game was at a level where it would both be reasonably high-quality (we are still in beta, after all) and would also have enough content to be, you know, *fun*. That's why we are coupling the NDA drop with our next major update to the game.


The new update will include a collection reset, some visual polish updates, a slew of bug fixes, and the *Amonkhet* block card sets. More details on the update are coming later next week, so I'll stop at that. I don't want to steal any more of Chris Clay's thunder.


Now, I am not a digital game designer. I have done absolutely nothing to make sure that all the sweet stuff in next week's update comes to pass (fortunately for you). No, dear community, my efforts have been put toward something much dearer to me: supporting all of you out there who are interested in creating content for *MTG Arena*.


Content I will gleefully devour.


Creator Kits
============


Dropping an NDA is useless if you don't help people make content for your game. With that in mind, we want to try and support our content creators in a way we, quite frankly, haven't really done before. We have so many passionate fans of our game, and we want to make it as easy and rewarding as possible for you to all help share that passion with the world.


Getting started can be a daunting task, and we want to do our best to help make it much easier. Creator kits are our way of helping to reduce the barriers to entry for new content creators, as well as providing tools to help burgeoning creators increase the quality of their content.


These creator kits are public and free to download (though our [Fan Content Policy](http://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy) does apply). And you can do so right now.

The kits include visuals, stream overlays, and a detailed best-practices guide with advice straight from well-known creators in the community. Each of these creators freely gave their words of wisdom so that any prospective creators out there could learn some of the lessons that they themselves learned the hard way. As The Professor says in the guide, "One person's success is everyone's success."


Ultimately, that is what this is all about: building communities. Creator kits were designed to help provide a path into our community of content creators.


Helping Creators for the Long Haul
==================================


Our content creators are some of the most passionate fans of our game, and they have all done incredible work helping to spread that fervor to their own fans and communities. We think it's about time we stepped up our game and did our best to contribute in any way we can to the long-term success of some of our most ardent supporters (and well-meaning critics).


Starting in April, *MTG Arena* creators will be able to apply to join a more formalized program for content creators. Creators in the program will be eligible for support and benefits aimed at helping grow their audiences, improve the quality of their content, and hopefully set them up for success. I'll have more details on our creator program efforts in the near future. It's something I've been working on (and getting creator input on) for a long time, so I can't wait to share more!


T-Minus One Week
================


It's going to be an exciting year for *Magic*. We've been around for 25 years, and we are ecstatic to have all of you be a part of this year of celebration. We want to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the content creators who have been sharing the game they love with the world these past years. We could never have gotten to where we are without you, and we couldn't ask for better ambassadors for our game.


One more week until the NDA drops. Only one more week until all of you content creators out there, both present and future, are able to start sharing our newest game with your communities. Honestly, at this point, I can't wait to see where things go from here.


Show me what you've got.
