Experience is a sculptor.


The world impinges on us, creates dings and dents in us that mold us into who we are. Life gives our identity shape, and separates our actual path from all the potentials.


The same is true for other planeswalkers, like Ajani. Ajani has gone through some serious life-sculpting lately.

We decided *Shards of Alara* would be a good time to do a web comic about Ajani, because he's the first planeswalker character to appear on more than one planeswalker card. [Flight of the White Cat](/magic/multiverse/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature2/1694) is the story surrounding the ignition of Ajani's planeswalker spark — in effect, his creation story — and it highlights his connection to Alara. Although we saw him first in the *Lorwyn* set, Ajani is actually a Nacatl leonin native to Naya, the shard of Alara suffused with red, white, and green mana. As the web comic narrates, after Ajani discovered his brother was killed, Ajani's first planeswalk was to the "adjacent" shard of Jund. On Jund Ajani met the planeswalker [Sarkhan Vol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol), who showed him a new kind of magic (namely, the volcanic, fiery red magic of Jund) that allowed him to open up and externalize his inner rage about his murdered brother. Experience hammered away at Ajani, awakening multiple new character traits in him all at once, creating the ongoing sculpture of his life.

We want to show this kind of progression for many of the planeswalker characters, although not every path will be the same. Some planeswalkers may grow in stature and get more powerful as they learn more and more about different types of magic. Some planeswalkers may shift in color alignment, repudiating some of their past beliefs and adopting new ones in response to dramatic life changes. Others will continue on undaunted, hewing closely to their previous trajectory, forging their own path through life in the absence of experiences sensational enough to warp their perceptions or powers. There are as many possible paths as there are planeswalkers.


* Ajani Vengeant vs. Ajani Goldmane

So which is which? Between [Ajani Vengeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant) and [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane), which happens first?


[Ajani Vengeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant), despite its card releasing later, actually represents Ajani as a younger cat-man, just after his spark ignites. He's full of rage and righteous vengeance, letting nothing stand in his way as he discovers who was behind his brother's death (which is still a mystery). [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) actually represents Ajani later in life, a bit calmer and wiser, his magic use perhaps less ostentatious but more devoted toward the development of the souls of others. You can see in [Flight of the White Cat](/magic/multiverse/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature2/1694) how Ajani's early magic, before he was a planeswalker, anticipates this later stage in his life — his healing magic, for example, only helps others, not himself. But it takes many years for life to mold him into that shape — first he has to crash through the emotions of his brother's death.


Check out the art of the two Ajani Vengeant cards. This is the one you saw at prerelease and release events for *Shards of Alara*:


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf10_ajanipromo.jpg)And here's the version you'll find in Shards of Alara booster packs:


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/stf/stf10_ajanifull.jpg)Both of them show Ajani as a young Nacatl leonin, gripped by a seething fury over the death of his brother, Jazal. He looks youthful here, a fierce cat of the jungle, his armor simple and primitive. Compare those to the [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) card art.
