![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a775.jpg)"I think I have played Ben more than any other player at high level events..." mused Gary. Never one to miss a chance for a barb, Ben asked dryly, "How's your record?"  
 Stuff like that rolls off Gary's back though and he merely answered, "I think 2-3-1—not sure."

The two players have both seen their fair share of success in a variety of tournament types from Grand Prix to the Pro Tour to the defunct Masters Series but today they are clinging onto a shred of hope for a shot at Sunday and a decent money finish. They were both 5-4-1. When asked how his Extended deck for tomorrow was shaping up Gary laughed and asked, "Why? Do you have one I could borrow?"

### Game 1

After much shuffling—perhaps a tad too much—the game was finally underway. "Good luck," Gary offered his foe and he came back with a cryptic, "Have a great time."

Ben made the first play on the draw with a [Deftblade Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deftblade+Elite). Gary took a point before he played a 3/3 [Embalmed Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler) courtesy of [Haunted Cadaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Cadaver). Ben frowned and played a man of mystery. Gary decided to get in with his Brawler while Ben didn't have mana access to the Elite. He fell to eighteen and Ben went to seventeen. His [Toxin Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toxin+Sliver) further furrowed the younger player's brow, "This could be going better."

[Dragon Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Shadow) on the Brawler dropped the American to thirteen and Gary attempted a [Lingering Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Death) on the morph but it was [Disruptive Pitmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disruptive+Pitmage) and the spell was spiked. "Same effect," shrugged Gary.

[Aven Farseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Farseer) came out to hold the fort but without any morphs in sight it was going to be an uphill battle. He did take down a [Toxin Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toxin+Sliver) with a pair of [Gempalm Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Avenger)s but Gary had the [Reaping the Graves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaping+the+Graves) to get two creatures back and overwhelm his opponent.

Gary – 1 Ben – 0

### Game 2

Ben mulliganed his openers with a cry to the rafters, "Almighty! What have I done? I pray every night!!!" His second hand was more acceptable and they were off. Ben played a morph and Gary made another 3/3 Brawler with the help of a [Twisted Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Abomination).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a773.jpg)Ben did not have a fourth land and played the mighty [Mistform Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Warchief). It did seem pretty mighty when he double blocked the Brawler on the next turn and used the Warchief's ability to become a bird and returned it with his [Raven Guild Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven+Guild+Initiate). Gary played a [Toxin Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toxin+Sliver).

The Warchief returned and Gary kept attacking. He cycled [Sunfire Balm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunfire+Balm) to save his morph and played a [Withered Wretch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). 

The [Mistform Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Warchief) powered out a [Gempalm Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Avenger) to hold the ground. It traded with the [Toxin Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toxin+Sliver) and Gary tried to go to the air with [Death's-Head Buzzard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s-Head+Buzzard) after cycling a [Twisted Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Abomination). Ben put a stop to that with a [Shoreline Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shoreline+Ranger) and Gary built up his forces with a [Corpse Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Harvester).

It was Ben's turn to control the air now and he played a face-up [Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven) after swinging in to take Gary to twelve. Another Death's-Head mucked up that plan but Ben pressed on with both his fliers. Gary blocked each flier and when Ben cycled a Gempalm things got interesting. Gary sacrificed his Buzzard in response, using the [Corpse Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Harvester)'s ability. The Buzzard's ability killed the second buzzard but when that bird's trick went on the stack Ben responded with an [Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer) to save his Aven. Gary found a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and another Harvester.

He used the extra mana to pay for a [Crowd Favorites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crowd+Favorites). Gary was on the ropes and had to play a [Wingbeat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingbeat+Warrior) in the hopes of eating the freshly replayed Aven but Ben had the [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) for the win.

### Game 3

Once more there was a turn three Brawler from Gary and Ben played a morph. Gary swamp cycled for his fourth land and cast [Lingering Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Death) on the morph. Ben played a [Daru Encampment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Encampment) and swung in and played a morph. Ben played another morph and let his [Frontline Strategist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontline+Strategist) go.

Gary got in for three more and played a [Death's-Head Buzzard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s-Head+Buzzard). Ben island cycled for land number five and played a [Mistform Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Warchief) after pulling the game even at fourteen-all.

The [Embalmed Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler) changed the life totals to 13 – 9 in Gary's favor and another morph was sent to the front lines. Ben played a potentially juicy [Aven Farseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Farseer) and passed the turn. Gary sent in the team and unmorphed a mid-combat [Daru Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Lancer) but Ben was ready with the [Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer)—and got a 3/3 bird soldier in the process. Gary lost tremendous tempo and when Ben played a Seaswift he could no longer even mount a reasonable attack. He tried to set up a win for the next turn with a [Celestial Gatekeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Gatekeeper) but Ben was able to finish him off with [Choking Tethers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choking+Tethers).

**Final Result:** Gary – 1 Ben – 2
