I am sorry, Mr. Editor, I fully intended to bring you a breaking story from here in Valencia, Spain, where we have been furiously working to get everything ready for the live webcast of Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. I hope you will accept this note to explain why I was not actually able to write this week's edition of The Week That Was. 

I landed yesterday afternoon and spent most of the day wandering around in a jet-lagged haze trying desperately NOT to fall asleep. I was well past the twenty-fourth hour of being awake—I had not been able to fall asleep on the plane at all—but I knew that going to sleep any time before a "normal" bedtime would be potentially disastrous.
