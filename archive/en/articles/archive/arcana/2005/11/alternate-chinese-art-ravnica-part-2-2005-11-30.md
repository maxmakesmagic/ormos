Since the city-plane of Ravnica, especially the Golgari and Dimir guilds, are full of undead, there were several cards in the *Ravnica* set that needed retouching for the Chinese market. [Earlier this month](/en/articles/archive/alternate-chinese-art-ravnica-part-1-2005-11-14) we took a look at two *Ravnica* cards that had alternate art commissioned for their Chinese printings. Today we take a look at a couple more.

[Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) takes on an interesting new look with the hood and glowing eyes instead of his bald skull. He loses the raw, bony malice of the original art -- when you're looking for a brutally efficient assassin, go with the guy with the jawless skull and vacant eyesockets -- but he does gain a kind of Jawa-esque mystery in the Chinese version.

In its Chinese printing, [Recollect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recollect) gives up the whole "Alas, poor Yorick" concept for a more abstract scene in which the Golgari elf contemplates a magical bauble of the past. 

There are three other *Ravnica* cards with alternate Chinese art, which we'll investigate in a future Arcana.
