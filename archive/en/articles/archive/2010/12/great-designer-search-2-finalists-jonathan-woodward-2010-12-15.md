### Commentary:


My design priorities were twofold: Clarify the color-based identities, and motivate gameplay by developing Devon's invasion idea.


Utopia focuses on aspects of each color that do not necessitate a fight to the death:  

• White (community): creatures entering the battlefield; lifegain.  

• Blue (scholarship): card draw; activated abilities.  

• Black (ambition): gold; mercenaries.  

• Red (art, passion): flameweaving; one-shot mana generation.  

Green (growth): +1/+1 counters; proliferate; putting lands onto the battlefield.


I featured these mechanics in a common charm cycle for which each set of choices "tells a story" of what it means to belong to a color in Utopia. The rare win condition enchantments emphasize the values of each color.


For the invasion theme, I chose Jay Treat's idea of hybrid invaders. The hybrid border will make them easily distinguishable – it's almost as if they've invaded the booster pack! Hybrid contrasts with the natives' mono-colored themes, but still allows the invaders to use the colored effects that the natives avoid. Finally, with hybrid, a single invader card can fit into twice as many possible decks; two additional common cycles may suffice for Limited. I gave them a tribal ability that counts whether you control at least one other invader, which encourages including invaders in a deck only if there are enough to support each other. I named them "Anunnaki," after the upstart Sumerian deities, as I wanted a unique creature type for this new tribe.  

Incidentally, I wasn't sure how we were supposed to express which cycle was inspired by a card designed by someone else. In my case, the rare alternate win condition cycle was suggested by Babblefish, and the first card for it designed by Kharg.
