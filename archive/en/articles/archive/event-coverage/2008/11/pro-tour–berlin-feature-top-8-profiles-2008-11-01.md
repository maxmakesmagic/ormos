 Four Jitte and one Big Mike (Mycoloth) to just attrition them out.

**Age:** 25


**Hometown:** Hof

I tested with some friends.

Faeries, because it wins versus Elfball.

It evolved a lot.

Early disruption, good sideboard.

**Jan Doise**


**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Leuven, Belgium


**Occupation:** Process Engineer


**Number of Times Playing on the Pro Tour:** 15-20


**How did you qualify for Pro Tour-Berlin?** Pro Points


**Number of GP/PT Top 8s:** 3 GP, 1st Pro Tour


**Other previous Magic accomplishments:** Belgian National Champion 2002


**How did you prepare for Pro Tour- Berlin? Who did you prepare with?**  

Tested 4-5 evenings and emailed a lot with all the Belgians, Frank Karsten and Zac Hill.


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Elves! We had it about three weeks before the Pro Tour, didn't look back and tuned it to perfection.


**How did your deck evolve during your testing?**   

As mulliganing a lot seemed the deck's biggest problem, I took out cards that made you mulligan more (Distant Melody, Chord of Calling). Mirror Entity proved to be the best win condition.


**What deck did you think was going to be the most-played archetype in Berlin?**  

Zoo.


**How was your deck designed to beat the most-played archetype?**  

Essence Warden/Wirewood Hivemaster/Wirewood Symbiote are creatures that Zoo loses to if they don't kill it.


**What is the worst matchup for your deck?**  

Decks with a lot of hate against Elves. If you really want to beat it, it's not too hard (Chalice of the Void, Darkblast, Trinisphere...)

"Tezzerator"  

Tezzeret wins against everything almost by himself.


**How did your deck evolve during your testing?**   

We tried different colors, and ended up with Blue / Red splashing green for Ancient Grudge. We cut the white, which we had for Condemns. Last minute, we added Riptide Laboratory.

Elves. It's just the best deck – very synergistic, consistent and fast! Martin Juza told me and I trust him.


**How did your deck evolve during your testing?**   

The version changed only a little bit from the original version and the board got tuned.

Zoo for sure, and a lot of Elves
