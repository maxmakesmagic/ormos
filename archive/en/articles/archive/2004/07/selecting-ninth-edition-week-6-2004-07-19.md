Welcome to the sixth week of [Selecting *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/home)! [Last week](/en/articles/archive/selecting-ninth-edition-week-5-2004-07-12) saw the battle of [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) vs. [Rewind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind) and [Confiscate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscate). Though the dialogue was heated on both sides on the message boards, the actual result was a blowout!

### Card Vote #6


In another twist, this vote offers you three choices to pick from. In honor of Red Week you’ll be choosing between [Balduvian Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balduvian+Horde) from *Alliances*, [Goblin Goon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Goon) from *Legions*, and [Rathi Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Dragon) from *Tempest*. All of these cards offer enormous bodies for their casting cost but each comes with a different drawback to make up for it. [Balduvian Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balduvian+Horde) only loses you 1 card from the hand to [Rathi Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Dragon)’s two cards already in play, but it’s a random card. Meanwhile [Goblin Goon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Goon) offers the largest body of all three, but comes with the requirement to gain creature superiority.


Three cards enter, one leaves! Which will it be?

### Sketch Vote #2


For this week’s sketch vote it’s time for a facelift for Blue’s iconic fat flier, [Mahamoti Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mahamoti+Djinn). Pick whichever you like best and the winning sketch will be fleshed out into the final art for FatMoti’s *Ninth Edition* appearance!


This week’s vote pits Paolo Parente against Greg Staples.
