[Grand Prix Ottawa](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpott14) is done and dusted, and that means it's time to take our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Eleven of the Top 25 were in action, navigating their way through the vagaries of *Khans of Tarkir* Limited. It's a format where players frequently get to play all of their good cards, thanks to the excellent mana fixing available, but that certainly didn't stop the top pros from showing their edge over the field—seven of the eleven gained Pro Points, and two made it all the way to the Top 8.


Shahar Shenhar warmed up for the defense of his World Championship title by finishing 5th, taking him past Ben Stark and Paul Rietzl to No. 14. Just behind him in Ottawa was 6th-place finisher Sam Black, who is this week's biggest mover in the chart, up three to No. 11. Next in line was William Jensen. Last season, he made an astonishing *eight* trips to the GP Top 8 tables, but here he had to settle for 14th. That was enough for 3 Pro Points, and No. 7 in the rankings—now ahead of Eric Froehlich and Yuuya Watanabe, neither of whom were in action last weekend.


Just outside the Top 16 in Ottawa was [Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk) Champion Ari Lax. His 12–3 record was enough for 17th place, and 3 Pro Points, which allowed him to open a small gap over Jensen. Lax remains at No. 6. Also finishing in the Top 32 in Ottawa was Andrew Cuneo, who moves up a place to No. 22. That left Reid Duke and Owen Turtenwald to claim a Pro Point each, finishing 36th and 41st, respectively. Duke used that point to sneak past the inactive Shaun McLaren into No. 3, while Turtenwald could hardly improve on his No. 1 spot. He does, however, now have a double-digit Pro Points lead over No. 2 Jérémy Dezani, who is tied for the least number of Pro Points this season among the Top 25.


Next up are Grand Prix Strasbourg (*Khans of Tarkir* Limited) and San Antonio (Standard) before we kick into overdrive for the ultimate week in the *Magic* calendar—Worlds Week!


With World's Week taking place from Tuesday to Sunday next week, we'll be back with the next update to the rankings on December 8.
