What do these *Tenth Edition* creatures have in common?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1396_spellshaped.jpg)They are all creatures "shaped" by spellshapers in *Future Sight*: [Cloudseeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudseeder), [Skirk Ridge Exhumer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Ridge+Exhumer), [Sparkspitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparkspitter), and [Llanowar Mentor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Mentor). 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1396_spellshaper_spitter.jpg)**Magic Online** creates tokens when you activate these spellshapers, but you might use spare copies of the creatures from *Tenth Edition* as their tokens in the tabletop world.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1396_spellshaped_tokens.jpg)[Sliversmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliversmith) makes a [Metallic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Sliver) token, which of course doesn't appear in *Tenth Edition*. A vanilla, artifact Sliver would have been pretty strange all by itself in a core set!

But the biggest mystery is [Goldmeadow Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Lookout). It creates a token with the name of no existing **Magic** card. *Future Sight* indeed?
