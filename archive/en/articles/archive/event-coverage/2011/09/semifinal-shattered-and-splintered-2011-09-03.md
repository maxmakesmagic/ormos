Samuele Estratti (Pester Twin) vs. Chikara Nakajima (Affinity)
--------------------------------------------------------------


[Sam Black vs. Josh Utter-Leyton](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptphi11/sf2)


Chikara Nakajima had exploded out of his quarterfinal with some outrageous opening hands from his mono-red Affinity deck, leaving Max Sjöblom bruised and battered in his quarter-final despite having made a strong start. Sjöblom had been playing the Blue-Red [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) combo, and Nakajima faced a similar opponent in his semi-final matchup against [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin).

*Newcomer Samuele Estratti with [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Splinter%2BTwin) Combo faces veteran Chikara Nakajima with Affinity here in the semifinals.*

Samuele Estratti was in his first Pro Tour Sunday but had excelled under the light to brush past Andrejs Prost in his quarterfinal. Despite being a relative unknown in his first Pro Tour Sunday, Samuele Estratti had the best Modern record of any of the players in the Top 8 and had played superbly across all three days of the Pro Tour. He would not be an easy opponent for the veteran Japanese player.


 


### Game One


[Launch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Launch)ing the semifinal into life, Samuele Estratti began digging through his deck with the familiar blend of blue cantrips: [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) on the first turn, then [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand) on his second. Across the table, the Affinity madness of Chikara Nakajima made a slow but steady start, turning a [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) on the first turn into a [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) and [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), with the added Infect threat of an [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) on hand.


Adding a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to his pair of [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s, Estratti cast a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), untapping an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) to immediately cast another [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain).


The threat from the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combination was clear, but Nakajima had a reply. Sacrificing all his artifacts to the [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) to make it a 4/4, he activated his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), then cast [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling), hurling the [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) across the table to kill the [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). The Ravager left play, and its modular +1/+1 counters moved onto Nakajima's [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). The beefed-up land nipped into the red zone to put Estratti up to five poison counters, and halfway dead!


Estratti needed an answer, and he found one. As Nakajima activated his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) on the following turn the Italian responded by casting another [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), tapping down the deadly land before it could attack. The Japanese player followed up with a [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), but that was only two artifacts, so Nakajima's [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) would not be big enough to kill the [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) if Estratti could find a [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) to staple to it! Passing the turn, Nakajima hoped for the best.


The Italian didn't immediately cast [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), and it looked like Nakajima had another chance to win the game. Estratti cast two [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), leaving himself with only three lands untapped, then passed the turn back to Nakajima.


The Japanese player drew a card and paused briefly before animating his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) for a second time, only to have Estratti tap it back down again with a third [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch)!


It was all a repeat of the last turn, but this time Estratti had the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) ready. As Estratti enchanted his [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) with the deadly Aura, Chikara Nakajima knew the game was up and conceded defeat.


Estratti 1, Nakajima 0


Sideboarding would help both players in this matchup. Estratti had a whole host of removal to move in, with [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)s to block, [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives); Nakajima could add in a trio of [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb)s to shut Estratti's combo down entirely. Estratti's deck would be moving in more cards, but the Nakajima's [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb)s were high-impact additions.


 


### Game Two


Taking the first turn after Estratti was forced to mulligan, Nakajima began his fightback by spewing forth a [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), and [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest). It was a faster opening than the lonely [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) in the first game, although the Skirge did join the party on Nakajima's second turn. The Japanese player attacked, reducing Estratti to 16 life, but missed a second land drop and passed the turn.


Estratti began whittling down Nakajima's offense, playing a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) then zapping the [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) with a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Back to Nakajima, and without his [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) the Japanese player's assault was stalling. A second attack only put Estratti down to 14, although Nakajima found a second land and was able to cast his [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb). The Orb would eventually disrupt the Italian's combo, but did little to help Nakajima reduce Estratti to 0 life any time soon.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptphi11/sf1_nakajima2.jpg)
*Nakajima verifies the game state.*

Estratti deployed a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) as a blocker, but Nakajima immediately burnt it away with a [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) and attacked again. Nakajima whittled Estratti down to 12, then added a [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) to the assault.


Estratti hid behind a second [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), but there was no sign of the Italian breaking out with his combo just yet—or even of being able to shatter the [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) across the table. A second [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) toasted the [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and Nakajima attacked once again! Estratti scrapped the [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) with an [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) but took another round of damage, dropping to 8.


Samuele Estratti was on the ropes. He could flashback the [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) to smash the [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb), but he only had two cards in hand andneeded them to be a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) and [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin).


Estratti went for it. He crushed the [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) with [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), responded to Nakajima's attack with the [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), and then untapped to cast the inevitable [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) to the roar of his supporters. Deflating slightly, Chikara Nakajima scooped up his permanents for a second time.


Estratti 2, Nakajima 0


 


### Game Three


If ever Chikara Nakajima needed a repeat of the incredible draws he had produced to win his quarterfinal, it was now. Unfortunately for the Japanese player the best he could manage was a lonely [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest). The Affinity offense added more muscle on the second turn, however, with a [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) beating out a tune to produce an [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), and the Ravager brought along a [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) to the party.


[Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ing through his first turn, Samuele Estratti dropped the 0/4 body of a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) between himself and the artifact hordes, but it wasn't enough to deter Nakajima from attacking. Animating his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), Nakajima sent his whole team into the Red Zone, with [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest), [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), and [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) all attacking. Estratti blocked the [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) with his [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) while Nakajima smashed up his [Darksteel Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel) and [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) to add +1/+1 counters to his [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager).


The end result was Estratti dropping to 14 life and picking up two poison counters. Nakajima played a land and a [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), then emptied his hand entirely by laying a [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb)!


Samuele Estratti played a third land and mutely passed the turn back. The [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) shut down any [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) or [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) trickery, but the Italian was still hanging onto his lone [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) as defense.


Nakajima played a second [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) and attacked, sending his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) into the fray. Samuele Estratti counted the artifacts Nakajima had available and deduced that the Japanese player had enough that he could sacrifice everything to add +1/+1 counters to his [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), then sacrifice the Ravager to move those to the [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and win the game with a single high-impact infect attack. The Italian cast a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) and blocked as best he could, but every movement of the Italian's body was selling the story that he believed he was about to lose: he blocked with a resigned "it doesn't matter" air, and then moved his hands to his cards, poised to scoop them up and begin shuffling for the next game.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptphi11/sf1_banner.jpg)
*The anguish of Samuele Estratti*

It was all an elaborate act, of course, and Estratti was trying to sell Nakajima on the idea that he could win that turn. Samuele Estratti still had his [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and would be able to intercept the killing blow to move all the +1/+1 counters from [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) onto his own [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) instead of Nakajima's [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus)! It was worth a try, but Chikara Nakajima was far too old a wolf to fall for a trick like that. Ignoring the Italian's mind games, he simply allowed combat damage to resolve normally, dealing 5 damage and two poison counters to his opponent.


The Italian added a [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) to his [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) on the next turn, but so long as the [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) was out there, his combo was worthless. Passing the turn back, Estratti was tapped out and seemingly helpless, still vainly trying to sell Nakajima on his vulnerability. Nakajima still wasn't interesting in buying anything, and for a second turn the Japanese player attacked and allowed everything to happen normally. That attack dropped Estratti to 4 life and 6 counters before Nakajima added a [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) to his force.


Estratti cast a Kiki-Jiki, the Mirror Breaker, but even the Akki Goblin couldn't help the Italian now. Chikara Nakajima untapped, cast a [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating), and struck back to take his first game!


Estratti 2, Nakajima 1


 


### Game Four


Samuele Estratti began the fourth game of the semifinal with a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), as we've come to expect from blue-red combo decks, while across the table Chikara Nakajima's Affinity deck spewed out [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) and [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum). The Japanese player added the game-breaking [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) to the table on his second turn.


Ramping up his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Inkmoth%2BNexus) and [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus)es on his third turn, Nakajima returned to the red zone although this time Estratti was waiting for him. Casting a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), the Italian blocked the [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), then he untapped and swept the board clean with a [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout).


The [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) had broken the first wave of Nakajima's assault, and Estratti was still sitting comfortably on 14 life after that exchange. His main objective remained the removal of Nakajima's [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb), though, as Estratti simply couldn't win with that artifact on the table!


Nakajima resumed the attack with a lonely [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog), but it was slow going against the Italian's life total. A second attack saw the [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) blocked by a [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), Nakajima having to sacrifice his [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) to keep the **Antiquities** creature alive, although a freshly minted [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) still nipped past to deal a point of damage. Estratti was down to 12, and dying a death of a thousand cuts while he searched for some way of destroying the [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb)!


Yet another attack from Chikara Nakajima reduced Estratti to 10, and the Japanese player added an [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) that threatened to accelerate the clock on his opponent. Estratti reacted by casting a second [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) at the end of Nakajima's turn, then enchanting it with [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). The [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) had once again destroyed his combo win, but the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) could still generate tokens to block with, buying the Italian time.


Nakajima attacked again, dragging his troops back into the red zone. Estratti produced a [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) token and blocked the [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog), dropping to 7 life. The Italian desperately needed to find an [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) or [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) in order to smash the Orb, or this slow grind would surely hand Nakajima another victory.


Samuele Estratti untapped and drew a [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), casting it straight away the Italian knew that any one of the cards he saw on top of his deck could be [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge)... they weren't, but Estratti did find a [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout). He reset Nakajima's offense for a second time, although the Japanese player was able to move two +1/+1 counters onto his [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus), which survived the firestorm thanks to good old flying.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptphi11/sf1_nakajima.jpg)
*...Is this it?*

Back to square one, Nakajima began rebuilding with another [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog). Estratti drew... another [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) that revealed another three cards that weren't [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge). The Italian played a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) as another blocker, and braced to defend himself once again.


Playing cards from the top of his deck as he drew them, Chikara Nakajima added a [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) to his team and attacked again, but made no headway at all against the [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) and [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite)'s splintered twin. Estratti was down to just 7 life, but Nakajima was now bashing his head against a brick wall, and was surely running out of time.


Pulling up a [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) on his next turn, Chikara Nakajima was still unable to get around Estratti's blockers. He needed more creatures, not ways of making his current team attack for more damage, because they were just smashing fruitlessly into Estratti's tokens.


Another turn had passed without Estratti getting any closer to death, and now time had run out for Chikara Nakajima.


Finally drawing an [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), Samuele Estratti smashed his opponent's [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) into a thousand shards. All the pieces of Estratti's combo were already on the battlefield, and with the Orb gone there was nothing standing in his way. A dejected Chikara Nakajima offered his hand in congratulations, while a very relieved Samuele Estratti advanced into the Final of Pro Tour Philadelphia!
