 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 









![Council of the Absolute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Council+of+the+Absolute)
[Council of the Absolute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Council+of+the+Absolute) – *Dragon's Maze* mythic rare. From the [*Dragon's Maze* FAQ](/en/node/633921) : 
  If you name half of a split card with fuse, and then you cast both halves, the cost reduction will apply to the total cost of the spell. This is true even if the half with the chosen name requires only colored mana to cast. 





![Blood Scrivener](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blood+Scrivener)
[Blood Scrivener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Scrivener) – *Dragon's Maze* rare. From the [*Dragon's Maze* FAQ](/en/node/633921) : 
  Any time you are instructed to draw more than one card, you draw them one at a time. For example, if you control [Blood Scrivener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Scrivener) and have no cards in hand and you're instructed to "draw two cards," your first card draw is replaced by drawing two cards and losing 1 life, then you'll draw the second card from the original instruction. In total, you'll draw three cards and lose 1 life. 



![Maze's End ](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/dgm/tiwoirwiixix/crr28ukl0k_EN.jpg)  
**Maze's End**  – *Dragon's Maze* mythic rare. Since we brought up the Gatekeepers on Tuesday and the Guildgates yesterday, it only stands to reason we show off the card that lets you fetch all those Gates. This is the promo card.

![Remote Farm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Remote+Farm)**[Remote Farm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remote+Farm)** – *Mercadian Masques* common. The market-filled Mercadia City stands atop an inverted mountain that dominates the small plane of Mercadia. The filth of the city's burgeoning markets (as mentioned in [Cloud Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Sprite)'s flavor text) explain why Mercadians keep their farms far from the city. Speaking of farms, the ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) generated by [Remote Farm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remote+Farm) can be used to activate [Farmstead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farmstead)'s ability. Combo! 
 


![Cartel Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cartel+Aristocrat)**[Cartel Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartel+Aristocrat)** – *Gatecrash* uncommon. The Orzhov are known for their wealth and greed, but they are also patrons of the arts. They commission architecture, *objets d'art*, and ([at least in some cases](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/238)) performance art extolling the virtues held dear by the guild. Many, such as their aristocrats, maintain extensive museums and private collections. 
 


![2691](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2691)**[Hipparion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2691)** – *Ice Age* uncommon. The horse-like hipparions are real animals—or, rather, they were. The hipparions of Earth roamed across the Northern Hemisphere for millions of years. The [Hipparion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hipparion)s of Dominaria were, as [General Jarkeld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=General+Jarkeld) suggests in the flavor text, not good mounts for warriors. 
 


![Zodiac Pig](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zodiac+Pig)**[Zodiac Pig](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Pig)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* uncommon. According to folklore, the Jade Emperor of China invited animals to race across a river to be placed in the zodiac. Pig, who was sometimes depicted as lazy and sometimes just as a bad swimmer, came in last and claimed the twelfth and final position. 
 


![Flock of Rabid Sheep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flock+of+Rabid+Sheep)**[Flock of Rabid Sheep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flock+of+Rabid+Sheep)** – *Unglued* uncommon. As a card from an Un-set, [Flock of Rabid Sheep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flock+of+Rabid+Sheep) is legal in every sanctioned format that allows silver-bordered cards... which is zero! However, if you are putting together a deck in, say, Modern or Commander that requires a creature with the Sheep subtype, [you are in luck](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=you+are+in+luck).
