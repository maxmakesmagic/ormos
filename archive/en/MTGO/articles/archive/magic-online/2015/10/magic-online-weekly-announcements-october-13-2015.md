**There Will Be No Downtime for October 14, 2015**


Over the past several weeks, users have experienced lag as *Magic Online* returns from downtime. To avoid the negative impact this issue has on our players, we will be postponing this week's downtime and working on a fix that we can use going forward. Because of this, **redemption will be postponed until our next downtime**.


The Wednesday, October 21 downtime will occur as normal.

* [Kiora, Master of the Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths)’s second loyalty ability does not properly put all cards into the player’s Revealed Cards area.
* When a card with the devoid ability is given a color (perhaps by a [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), it appears with distorted art.
* Converge cards do not indicate how many colors of mana were spent to cast the spell.
* Cards put into the graveyard with [Kiora, Master of the Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths)’s second loyalty ability do not properly trigger the second ability of [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant).
* The prompt box displays the incorrect color during the “scry-like” step in the new mulligan process.
* Several *Battle for Zendikar* promo cards appear with the incorrect set symbol.
* [Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower)’s triggered ability incorrectly allows a player to select an face down exiled land card.
* When [Chasm Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chasm+Guide)’s triggered ability is triggered by [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), it will appear with incorrect art on the stack.
* Cards that are exiled by [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) incorrectly show association arrows while in the Exiled Zone.
* In the Collection scene, the filter for the *From the Vault: Angels* set appears out of place (above *Battle for Zendikar* instead of with the other *From the Vault* sets).
* When [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear.
* The Ingest keyword ability displays extraneous text in the game log when resolving.
* The landfall ability of [Emeria Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Shepherd) is not optional.
