As always with a new Limited format, in the early days, you get some wildly differing opinions with regards even to the basics. In *Kaladesh* Limited, some people are trying to avoid mana trouble at all costs, while others like to be quite liberal with splashes. We collected some of these opinions …

**2016 World Championship finalist Márcio Carvalho:** It depends. If I got Prophetic Prism, I'll splash a Cloudblazer or Welding Sparks. In a green deck, with Wild Wanderer and Attune with Aether, anything is possible.

**Hall of Famer Bram Snepvangers:** Obviously, it depends on the deck. If possible, I usually splash something.

**Pro Tour Prague 2006 quarterfinalist Quentin Martin:** In Sealed Deck, pools are deep enough and the format is so aggressive. I wouldn't splash if I could help it.

**24-time Grand Prix Top 8er Martin Jůza:** Absolutely splashing. I mean, if you can afford it. But splashing's often worth it. Usually, you need to be green, but any deck can do it with Prophetic Prism/Aether Hub. I like that R&D made it so that you can't splash Gearhulks though!

**Grand Prix Rimini 2016 champion: Arne Huschenbeth:** Splashing, yes definitely. There are so many super strong uncommons like Restoration Gearsmith or Cloudblazer. Plus, the format isn't super aggressive.
