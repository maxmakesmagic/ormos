Ignacio Ibarra Del Rio and Marc Lalague had a chance to meet earlier in the final swiss round of the Grand Prix. However, their match never concluded, as both players preferred drawing in when one of the threats that could leap-frog one of them in the standings lost their match.


Now, the two get the chance to resolve their games. Who would win after their third – and final – match of the day? Would it be Ibarra Del Rio's white-red aggressive deck, or Lalague's removal-fueled blue-red strategy?



### The Games



Admittedly, it's pretty hard to call the first game, by all rights, "a game." This is primarily due to Ibarra Del Rio getting more than enough creatures on board to finish off Lalague before he could draw a second land, a result of a rough keep on a mulligan to six.

The second game didn't start out any better as both players shipped their seven back. "I've still yet to see a hand with more than one land!" Lalague exclaimed. This time, however, it was Ibarra Del Rio's turn to mulligan into oblivion, as he went to five while Lalague kept a plaable hand. "I keep," Ibarra Del Rio said with a shake of the head. His frustration was revealed when he missed a second land, but found one on the third turn to [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) Lalague's [Crackling Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Triton).


The third game got off to an even start from both players, with Ibarra Del Rio leading with Calvary Pegasus into [Spearpoint Oread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearpoint+Oread), and Lalague sifting through cards with scry lands and [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker). [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) kept Lalague from falling behind to an [Ill-Tempered Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ill-Tempered+Cyclops), and [Fanatic of Mogis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) gave Ibarra Del Rio a reason to keep his [Spearpoint Oread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearpoint+Oread) back on defense.

A second [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) on [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary) when Ibanna Del Rio cast the 3/3 was thwarted by Favor of the Gods, allowing him to keep his 3/3 on the offense. However, despite the Emissary's power, Lalague kept coming out with bigger creatures. While Ibanna Del Rio had a few draw steps to out-match Lalague's plays, three lands in three draw steps left him without any outs.


While the first two games were decided by a glut of spells over lands, this game ultimately ended due to a glut of lands over spells. With no spells left, Ibanna Del Rio offered the handshake.
