The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 14, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by so many previews. We're almost to the full reveal! Just two more days!


Today's Previews
================


For the previews not already found on DailyMTG, look no further than this section here. Well, click on the links below, but, no further than that. After that, you're good for the day.

Scale birds means it's big. Scale buildings means it's really big.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* – TechRaptor Kaladesh Preview Cards](http://techraptor.net/content/magic-gathering-techraptor-preview-cards) | TechRaptor | Brandon Bobal

The theme of this one is inventions and inventors. Which is pretty much the theme of *Kaladesh*. That and Cloudblazer. The themes of *Kladesh* are inventions, inventors, and [Cloudblazer](https://twitter.com/blakepr/status/774252942723383296). Says me. The rest of our marketing team just frowns at me when I say that, though. And they think the banner is too much. They're just upset because [Cloudblazer](https://twitter.com/blakepr/status/774252942723383296) is in all caps. As is the entire banner.


1. [Spark of Creativity](https://pp.vk.me/c637328/v637328050/d136/V6kNYhCg60k.jpg)

Check out the translation for this unique red spell that can either deal damage or let you play an extra card [on Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/52q6ed/kld_%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0_creative_spark/) And, yes, the English version does say “play,” so this can let you play a land you reveal.


1. [Magic the Gathering: Kaladesh: Exklusives Kartenpreview (Disappearing Act)](http://gamezoom.net/artikel/MTG_Kaladesh_Kartenpreview-37041) | Game Zoom | Dominik Figl

I've seen a lot of talk about the death of blue and how this is strictly worse than [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) and etc., etc. But having played with this card in *Kaladesh* Limited, I can tell you that blinking and bouncing is part of what white-blue wants to be doing. Sure, you probably aren't playing this card in Standard, but that's fine. And if I ever get to play this and bounce a [Cloudblazer](https://twitter.com/blakepr/status/774252942723383296)? Well, I'll do a little lap around the room. Especially if that happens on camera this weekend during the [Loading Ready Run pre-prerelease](https://twitter.com/James_LRR/status/774663522839990274).

Geek and Sundry presents two Gremlin-themed cards here. One reprint and one, um, Gremlin.


1. [Captured by the Consulate](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/kaladesh-story) | *Kaladesh* Story page

Did you know that our [set pages](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/kaladesh-story) now contain links to all set-related stories? True story! And when those stories are related to cards, the cards get shown with the story's icon. Today's revealed card happens to be one you haven't seen yet...

Artificers! Many, many Artificers.


Also keep an eye on Polygon today. There’s a chance they might have a few vroom, vrooms to show off.


Today's Must
============


1. [From Underdog to Regular Dog: My World Championship Report |](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/from-underdog-to-regular-dog-my-world-championship-report/) ChannelFireball | Brian Braun-Duin

Posted late yesterday, this thorough and engaging report from the champ himself on his road to claiming that trophy. It's funny, engaging, full of humility, and jokes about Brad Nelson. It's one of the most entertaining and fun reports I've read in a while. And it just happens to be by the World Champion about his World Championship.


After All of That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
==================================================


1. [Diversity in Gaming part 2](https://www.patreon.com/posts/e064-diversity-2-6762496) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

I missed part 1 due to my vacation last week, but that's what part 2s are for! The Commanderin' guys visit with [Shivam Bhatt](https://twitter.com/elektrotal) to talk about, well, what the title says. Diversity in gaming. Sometimes it really is that simple. You can also see [part 1 here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/e063-diversity-1-6714837).

Let's not forget about Legacy. Brown walks through a few potentially Legacy-playable *Kaladesh* cards before delving into the recent trends in the metagame, including some shake-ups from some *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* and *Eldritch Moon* additions to the format.

We're getting closer to *Magic*'s Extra Life's event this weekend, a program set up to raise money for Seattle Children's Hospital. The event starts this Saturday at 8 a.m. on [Twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) and runs for 24 hours. We'll be showing off an Innistrad *Dungeons & Dragons* adventure, a donation Sealed event, a Commander event, some Legendary Cube, and more. The event will even be hosted by Marshall Sutcliffe, Kenji Egashira, Matt Tabak, and Ryan Spain. You can donate or find out [more information here](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=29451).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Blue-Black Zombies](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-mocs-2016-09-11)

Continuing our series of *Magic Online* Championship Series standouts that do well through the upcoming rotation, we have the Innistrad-heavy Blue-Black Zombies deck piloted by C\_E.L to a very spooky 13th place on Sunday (yes, for regular readers, we went from 3rd place yesterday to 13th today—turns out [Collected Company](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) does not survive rotation).


The deck loses virtually nothing in the transition, unsurprisingly. [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) is clearly very strong in the deck, but there are other discard options at two mana, like [Wharf Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wharf+Infiltrator). The sideboard loses a few friends in [Languish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) and [Dragonlord Silumgar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar), but the Dragonlord is a one-of. [Languish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) might be a loss, depending on how the metagame shapes up, but it's unlikely to be a fatal one.


Back in the old days, when Block Constructed was a supported format, the best Block Constructed decks would often transition well to the next Standard. Well, Blue-Black Zombies is definitely one of the best hypothetical *Shadows over Innistrad* block decks in the hypothetical world where Block Constructed is still a thing.
