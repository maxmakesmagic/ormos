Welcome to our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Last weekend was busy for many players looking to join their team captains at the World *Magic* Cup in December. It may yet be significant that the likes of Justin Robb (Australia), Alessandro Portaro (Italy), and Yohan Dudognon (France) won their WMCQs, and their haul of pro points in Nice, France, in December could catapult them onto our Top 25 leaderboard. For now, however, the rankings remain unchanged—the Qualifiers themselves don't award pro points.



So who might be gearing up for a push this coming weekend? The aforementioned Justin Robb will be among the favorites for Grand Prix Sydney, where a rapidly maturing *Magic 2015* Limited format will be on show. Using the advanced topological device known colloquially as a "map," there aren't many of our Top 25 within easy reach of Sydney. For the Europeans, it truly is halfway across the world, and there's plenty of loyalty miles to be had for any North Americans willing to make the trip.



The most likely travelers to Sydney might have been the Japanese trio of Yuuya Watanabe (No. 7), Yuuki Ichikawa (No. 14), and Kentaro Yamamoto (No. 25), plus Hong Kong's finest Lee Shi Tian (No.17). However, they may well prefer the Modern format on display at Grand Prix Kobe. Japanese fans of the Modern-format wunderkind Patrick Dickmann will be disappointed to learn that he's skipping Kobe, but he fully intends to visit Japan this season for a future Grand Prix.



So, most likely, next week will see France's Jérémy Dezani holding steady as the world's No.1. But the only way to know for sure is to join us again right here, at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
