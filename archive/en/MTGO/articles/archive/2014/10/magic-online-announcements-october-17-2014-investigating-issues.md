 David works on the Magic community team as a content specialist. He spends his days writing about Magic Online and trying to play too many colors at once in Limited. 






**4:05 p.m. PT:** *Magic Online* is now online again after this unplanned downtime. Some players who were in events when the system went down are reporting having their cards locked, preventing them from being traded. We plan to fix this issue for the affected players during the October 22 downtime.

**2:35 p.m. PT:** The issue affecting our systems has been resolved. We are in the process of bringing *Magic Online* back up. The current ETA for *Magic Online* is 3:45 p.m. Pacific.

*Magic Online* experienced an issue around 2:00 a.m. Pacific time that resulted in players being unable to connect, or stay connected to the system. We have been working to resolve this issue throughout the night, and work continues still. Players who were in events affected by this issue will not need to file reimbursement. We will grant entries back to these players automatically.


As of 9:40 a.m., we have restricted login so only our internal teams are able to access the game. Players are not able to access *Magic Online*, and those who were logged into the system have been automatically logged out.


We are hoping to reschedule any PTQ Prelims that were/will be impacted by this issue. Our ability to do so will be dependent upon the time of the issueâ€™s resolution.


We will continue to keep this post updated with further details as they develop.
