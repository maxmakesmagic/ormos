 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 






When I hear about origin stories, I think about superheroes. Characters like Spiderman, Superman, and Batman. These characters have origin stories. These characters have their stories told with pictures—with comic books. Naturally, when Blake told me he was looking for an origin story from me for Origins Stories Week, my thoughts went to comic books. I started digging and found a way to bring you my origin story in the way an origin story should be told.



Enjoy!
