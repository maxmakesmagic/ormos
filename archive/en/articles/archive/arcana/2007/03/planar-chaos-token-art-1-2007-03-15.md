When new cards create creature tokens, unique art is commissioned for the tokens’ representations in ***Magic** Online*. *Planar Chaos* adds five new pieces of art for those digital tokens. Today we look at three of them.

  
### Ape token

[Pongify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) is a transformation spell that turns a creature into a 3/3 Ape. Here’s the ape you’ll see when you cast [Pongify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) on ***Magic** Online*.

### Cat Warrior token


Jedit Ojanen of Efavra, *Planar Chaos’s* alternate-history legend, never decided to leave his tribe of cat warriors like the original Jedit Ojanen did. Here’s the art of the loyal, forestwalking tokens his card creates.

The larval stage of a Deadly Insect, *Planar Chaos’s*
[Deadly Grub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Grub) creates a monstrous 6/1 Insect creature token after it vanishes. Here’s the art of that scary grown-up token.
