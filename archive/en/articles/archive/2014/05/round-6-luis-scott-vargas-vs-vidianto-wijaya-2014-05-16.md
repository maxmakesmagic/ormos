 Luis Scott-Vargas is one of the most well-known players in **Magic**'s storied history. The most-recognizable face of one of the biggest teams in **Magic**, Team ChannelFireball, Scott-Vargas has at multiple points in his career been considered the best player on the planet. Nowadays, **Magic** has had to take a step back in his life, but he remains one of the best players in any tournament he enters. While his Hall of Fame status provides him access to the Pro Tour, Scott-Vargas is well short of the number of points required to have a reasonable chance of making it to the World Championship later this year. He needs a strong performance this Pro Tour to gain enough points to put him back on track. On the plus side, if he fails to make it to the Top 8 here in Atlanta, he's got a spot reserved for him in the coverage booth on Sunday.




 His opponent this round is Vidianto Wijaya, winner of Grand Prix Denver 2012. Wijaya managed back-to-back Top 100 finishes at both Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* and *Theros*. In Dublin, he was paired up against Raphael Levy of Team Revolution, who invited him to join the team after their match. Wijaya has proven to be a world-class gaming talent, and he's well on his way to another Top 100 finish this far through the tournament where he sits at 4-1.






*Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas has an incredible reputation and resume of impressive finishes, but Vidianto Wijaya has some impressive finishes of his own, including a win at Grand Prix Denver 2012.*
