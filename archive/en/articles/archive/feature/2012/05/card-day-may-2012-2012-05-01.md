![Archwing Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archwing+Dragon)**[Archwing Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archwing+Dragon)** – *Avacyn Restored* rare. The mountains of Stensia are a treacherous place to go exploring, as the travelers in the lower left of the [Archwing Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archwing+Dragon) illustration are learning.
 ![Runeboggle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Runeboggle)**[Runeboggle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeboggle)** – *Guildpact* common. When [Runeboggle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeboggle) resolves, its caster gets to draw a card even if the controller of the targeted spell pays ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif). However, if the targeted spell gets countered by something else before [Runeboggle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeboggle) resolves, [Runeboggle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeboggle) itself will be countered for having no legal targets, and its controller will *not* draw a card. Did you follow that?
 ![27162](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=27162)**[Life // Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=27161)** – *Apocalypse* uncommon. Although all split cards are named so they make sense when you say "and" between their titles, they tend to fall in two categories. Some, like [Stand and Deliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=20574) are common phrases. Others, like [Night and Day](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26691) and [Life and Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=27162) are opposites. R&D's favorite, of course, is [Research and Development](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=107375).
 ![Scrabbling Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scrabbling+Claws)**[Scrabbling Claws](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws)** – *Mirrodin* uncommon. When [Scrabbling Claws](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws) was printed, it was very similar to [Phyrexian Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Furnace), which already existed. But the Phyrexians didn't exist on Mirrodin, so a new card had to be made. But when *Scars of Mirrodin* came out, the Phyrexians got to Mirrodin after all.
 ![Legacy Weapon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Legacy+Weapon)**[Legacy Weapon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon)** – *Tenth Edition* rare. The *Tenth Edition* version of [Legacy Weapon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy+Weapon) contains references to seventeen other cards. To see them all, [read this Arcana from 2007](/en/articles/archive/legacy-weapon-answers-2007-07-17).
 ![Standardize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Standardize)**[Standardize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standardize)** – *Onslaught* rare. When [Standardize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standardize) was printed, the creature type "Wall" still had rules baggage that kept creatures from attacking. Since then, that effect has been moved to the keyword "defender," so Walls can now technically attack. But [Standardize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standardize) still has its restriction!
 ![King Suleiman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=King+Suleiman)**[King Suleiman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Suleiman)** – *Arabian Nights* rare. In *Arabian Nights*, there was a four-card cycle of Djinns and a four-card cycle of Efreets. Neither cycle had a white card, presumably because [King Suleiman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Suleiman) was holding them off. To this day, the only Djinn or Efreet in white is [Ruham Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruham+Djinn) in *Invasion*. (If you don't count [Changelings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?text=+%5Bchangeling%5D).)
 ![Goldnight Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goldnight+Commander)**[Goldnight Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldnight+Commander)** – *Avacyn Restored* uncommon. In one of his Making Magic articles, Mark Rosewater [said that](/en/node/655111) he made [Goldnight Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldnight+Commander) to give a little boost to the red/white decks.
 ![4034](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4034)**[Brassclaw Orcs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4034)** – *Fifth Edition* common. The flavor text for the *Fifth Edition* printing of [Brassclaw Orcs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4034) mentions Sarpadia. This is a reference to its original appearance in *Fallen Empires*, where three of the four versions of the Orcs ([here](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1938), [here](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1940), and [here](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1966)), quoted *Sarpadian Empires, Vol. IV*. The [fourth one](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1937), which doesn't mention Sarpadia, has the illustration that made it into *Fifth Edition*.
 ![Platinum Emperion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Platinum+Emperion)**[Platinum Emperion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* mythic rare. [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) first appeared in *Mirrodin* and it said this: "You can't lose the game and your opponents can't win the game." When **Magic** returned to the plane in *Scars of Mirrodin*, a new platinum creature was called for. And [Platinum Emperion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion) fit the bill!
 ![Gisela, Blade of Goldnight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gisela%2C+Blade+of+Goldnight)**[Gisela, Blade of Goldnight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela%2C+Blade+of+Goldnight)** – *Avacyn Restored* mythic rare. Gisela is the leader of Flight Goldnight and was one of the few witnesses to the battle between Avacyn and Griselbrand. Her despair at seeing Avacyn trapped in the Helvault would not go away until Avacyn's return.
 ![96829](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=96829)**[Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96829)** – *Guildpact* uncommon. If you run acoss an [Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) that shows someone in a pitched battle in a city street, you've got a special promotional version that came with an issue of the **Magic: The Gathering** comic book.
 ![Moonsilver Spear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Moonsilver+Spear)**[Moonsilver Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonsilver+Spear)** – *Avacyn Restored* rare. The [Moonsilver Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonsilver+Spear) is prominently held in the art of [Avacyn, Angel of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+Angel+of+Hope), which explains where all these Angels are coming from all of a sudden.
 ![Copperhoof Vorrac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Copperhoof+Vorrac)**[Copperhoof Vorrac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperhoof+Vorrac)** – *Mirrodin* rare. The tusks of [Copperhoof Vorrac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperhoof+Vorrac) show up again in *Scars of Mirrodin* as the horns held by [Copperhorn Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperhorn+Scout).
 ![Maalfeld Twins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Maalfeld+Twins)**[Maalfeld Twins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maalfeld+Twins)** – *Avacyn Restored* uncommon. The necromancer "Gisa the Mad" quoted in the flavor text of [Maalfeld Twins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maalfeld+Twins) is the twin of the equally mad necromancer Geralf, as referenced on [Geralf's Messenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger) and [Geralf's Mindcrusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Mindcrusher).
 ![Gustcloak Runner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gustcloak+Runner)**[Gustcloak Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Runner)** – *Onslaught* common. When Jay Moldenhauer-Salazar made *Onslaught*-centric chess-themed decks [for Daily MTG](/en/articles/archive/picking-pieces-2002-11-28), he used [Gustcloak Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Runner) and [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) to represent the pawns on the grounds that they're Soldiers.
 ![25871](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=25871)**[Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=25871)** – *Planeshift* common. According to the flavor text, the *Planeshift* version of [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=25871) depicts the death of [Darigaaz, the Igniter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darigaaz%2C+the+Igniter), when Darigaaz sacrificed himself to save the crew of the skyship *Weatherlight*. Learn more about Darigaaz's story [here](/en/articles/archive/darigaaz-legendary-dragon-2007-05-16).
 ![Commando Raid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Commando+Raid)**[Commando Raid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commando+Raid)** – *Onslaught* uncommon. *Onslaught*'s [Commando Raid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commando+Raid) essentially turns creatures into versions of [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) from the same set.
 ![Predator's Gambit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Predator%27s+Gambit)**[Predator's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Gambit)** – *Avacyn Restored* common. The art in [Predator's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Gambit) shows a vampire that has been forced into the position of being hunted, rather than the hunter. But that might not last, because the vampire is getting mad!
 ![Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Terminus)**[Terminus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus)** – *Avacyn Restored* rare. From the [*Avacyn Restored* FAQ](/en/node/633691): "Each player chooses the order for his or her own creatures. This order isn't revealed to other players."
 ![Flowering Lumberknot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flowering+Lumberknot)**[Flowering Lumberknot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowering+Lumberknot)** – *Avacyn Restored* common. From the [*Avacyn Restored* FAQ](/en/node/633691): "If the creature [Flowering Lumberknot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowering+Lumberknot) is paired with loses soulbond, [Flowering Lumberknot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowering+Lumberknot) will remain paired but won't be able to attack or block."
 ![Descent into Madness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Descent+into+Madness)**[Descent into Madness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descent+into+Madness)** – *Avacyn Restored* mythic rare. From the [*Avacyn Restored* FAQ](/en/node/633691): "First you choose the permanents and/or cards from your hand that will be exiled. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Then all the chosen permanents and cards are exiled simultaneously. Players who choose after you will know what permanents you'll be exiling when they choose. They'll know how many cards you'll be exiling from your hand, but they won't see those cards."
 ![Bonfire of the Damned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bonfire+of+the+Damned)**[Bonfire of the Damned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonfire+of+the+Damned)** – *Avacyn Restored* mythic rare. From the [*Avacyn Restored* FAQ](/en/node/633691): "[Bonfire of the Damned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonfire+of+the+Damned) targets only the player. Creatures with hexproof that player controls will be dealt damage by Bonfire of the Damned if it resolves."
