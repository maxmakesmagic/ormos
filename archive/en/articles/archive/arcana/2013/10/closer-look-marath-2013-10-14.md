Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 







Last week I introduced you all [to Marath](/en/node/650231), one of the new Commanders in the upcoming *Commander* (2013 Edition.) Now it's time to take a closer look at its art. I won't dive into the art description, because while it provides a few interesting tidbits, it leaves a lot up to [Tyler Jacobson](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Tyler%20Jacobson%22%5D). But I do love the art here and there are a few things you might not notice in the scaled down version.

Here's a blown up version of the art, check out his feet where vines grow up from the earth. I also love the variety in the antlers on its head; it's a very unique looking beast.
