S*cars of Mirrodin*, as you may have gathered, involves a return to the setting of *Mirrodin,* a plane conveniently named "Mirrodin." It also features the return of the Phyrexians, the villainous forces from some other sets.

*Mirrodin* was released in October 2003. And this website had been a going concern for about two years at that point, which means that there's a wealth of information about Mirrodin just waiting for someone to dig it up. So let's begin!

### Mirrodin Environments

Mirrodin has changed since the days of *Mirrodin*, but it's still worthwhile to look at what the plane used to look like. In this series of five arcanas, the Mirrodin style guide showed off different parts of Mirrodin.

* **[Mirrodin Environments: Blue](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-blue-2003-10-06)** (October 6, 2003)

* **[Mirrodin Environments: Green](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-green-2003-11-19)** (October 19, 2003)

### Random Fun

As the *Mirrodin* block went on, Arcana showed various entertaining and educating aspects of the cards and art. Here are some of them!

As long as we're going through the archives, here are a few tidbits about the Phyrexians that you might find interesting.
