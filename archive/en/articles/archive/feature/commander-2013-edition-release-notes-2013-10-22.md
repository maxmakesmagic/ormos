The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new **Magic: The Gathering** set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed. Notably, none of the cards that have been released in previous **Magic** products are listed.

---


**New Cards and Format Legality**


There are fifty-one cards within the ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* (2013 Edition) decks that are completely new to the **Magic** game. These cards are legal for play in the Vintage and Legacy formats only. They aren't legal for play in the Standard or Modern formats.


The other cards in this release are legal for play in any format that already allows those cards. That is, appearing in this release doesn't change a card's legality in any format.


For more information about **Magic** formats, please visit [Wizards.com/MagicFormats](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/resources/formats-sanctioned). For information about the format legality of a specific card, please visit [Gatherer.Wizards.com](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx), search for the card, and check the "Sets & Legality" tab.





---


**Overview**


Created and popularized by fans, the Commander variant is usually played in casual Free-for-All multiplayer games, although two-player games are also popular. Each player starts at 40 life, and each player's deck is headed by a legendary creature designated as that deck's commander. A player's choice of commander determines which other cards can be played in the deck.


A recommended banned list for the Commander format is maintained by the rules committee at [MTGCommander.net](http://mtgcommander.net/rules.php), not by Wizards of the Coast. On **Magic Online**, the Commander format follows that banned list.





---


**Commander Deck Construction**



* Commander decks are exactly 100 cards, including the deck's commander.
* The deck's commander must be a legendary creature.
* Commander is a "singleton" format. That is, other than basic lands, each card must have a different English name.
* A card can't be included in your deck if any mana symbol in its mana cost or rules text is a color not in your commander's color identity (see below). A card also can't be included in your deck if it has a color indicator defining it to be a color not in your commander's color identity.
* A commander's color identity includes its colors, as defined by its mana cost or color indicator, and also the colors of any colored mana symbols in its rules text.
* Color identity is established before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander becomes a different color.
* The colors of colored mana symbols found only in reminder text aren't part of a commander's color identity.
* A land card with one or more basic land types can't be included in your deck if it could produce mana of a color not in your commander's color identity.
* During the game, if mana that isn't a color in your commander's color identity would be added to your mana pool, that much colorless mana is added to your mana pool instead.




---


**Using Your Commander**


Commanders play a prominent role in games, often appearing on the battlefield multiple times.



* Your commander begins the game in the command zone, a game area created for the Commander format and now also used for nontraditional **Magic** cards (including Vanguard, Plane, and Scheme cards) and for emblems created by Planeswalkers. The other ninety-nine cards are shuffled and become your library.
* You may cast your commander from the command zone. Each time you do this, it costs ![2 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150519185605im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif) more to cast for each time you previously cast it from the command zone that game.
* If your commander would be put into your graveyard from anywhere or be exiled from anywhere, you may choose to put it into the command zone instead.

In addition to the normal rules regarding winning and losing the game, the Commander format has one other rule: A player who has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game.



* Players should keep track of combat damage dealt to them by each commander over the course of the game.
* This rule includes a player's own commander, which can deal combat damage to its owner if the commander is controlled by another player or if combat damage gets redirected to that player.




---


**Alternative Mulligan Rule**


The Commander variant uses an alternative mulligan rule: Each time a player takes a mulligan, rather than shuffling his or her entire hand of cards into his or her library, that player exiles any number of cards from his or her hand. Then the player draws a number of cards equal to one less than the number of cards he or she exiled this way. Once a player keeps an opening hand, that player shuffles all cards he or she exiled this way into his or her library.





---


**Leaving the Game**


Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after a player leaves the game (because that player lost the game or conceded).



* When a player leaves the game, all permanents, spells, and other cards owned by that player also leave the game.
* If that player controlled any abilities or copies of spells that were waiting to resolve, they cease to exist.
* If that player controlled any permanents owned by another player, the effects that gave control of them to the player who left end. If this doesn't give control of them to a different player (perhaps because they entered the battlefield under the control of the player who left), they're exiled.




---


**Rule Change: The "Planeswalker Uniqueness Rule" and the "Legend Rule"**


Two rule changes introduced with the ***Magic** 2014* core set impact how cards in this release function.


Under the previous rules, if there were two or more legendary permanents with the same name on the battlefield or two or more Planeswalkers that share a subtype (such as "Jace") on the battlefield, they would all be put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action. These rules have changed. The new rules are as follows:


704.5j If a player controls two or more Planeswalkers that share a Planeswalker type, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "Planeswalker uniqueness rule."


704.5k If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "legend rule."



* Notably, if another player controls a creature that's a copy of your commander, neither that creature nor your commander is affected. They both remain on the battlefield.




---


**Oversized Commanders**


Each ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* (2013 Edition) game pack comes with three oversized premium commander cards that correspond to traditional cards in the game pack. Only one of these can be the deck's commander during a given game.



* You must also have the traditional **Magic** card version of your commander.
* When the commander is in a public zone, such as the command zone or the battlefield, you may substitute the oversized card for the traditional **Magic** card.
* If your commander is in a hidden zone, such as your library or hand, use the traditional **Magic** card.
* The oversized cards are only for fun and aren't required for Commander game play.




---


**New Ability Word: Tempting Offer**


Tempting offer is an ability word that appears in italics on a cycle of sorceries. These cards have a beneficial effect, then give opponents the option to also enjoy that effect if they allow you to repeat it. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)



> ![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/gMr6XVYdUP_EN.jpg)Tempt with Glory  
> ![5 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150331031459im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_5_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20160519004405im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif)  
> 
> Sorcery  
> *Tempting offer*—Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control. Each opponent may put a +1/+1 counter on each creature he or she controls. For each opponent who does, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.



* Your opponents decide in turn order whether or not they accept the offer, starting with the opponent on your left. Each opponent will know the decisions of previous opponents in turn order when making his or her decision.
* After each opponent has decided, the effect happens simultaneously for each one who accepted the offer. Then, the effect happens again for you a number of times equal to the number of opponents who accepted.




---


**Legendary Creatures with "Mana Rewards" Abilities**


Some legendary creatures in this release have an effect that gets bigger the more mana you spent to cast them.



> ![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/KVpEYaZkC3_EN.jpg)Prossh, Skyraider of Kher  
> ![3 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165507im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_3_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528034551im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Red Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150518222449im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/red_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)  
> 
> Legendary Creature—Dragon  
> 
> 5/5  
> 
> Flying When you cast Prossh, Skyraider of Kher, put X 0/1 red Kobold creature tokens named Kobolds of Kher Keep onto the battlefield, where X is the amount of mana spent to cast Prossh.  
> 
> Sacrifice another creature: Prossh gets +1/+0 until end of turn.



* The amount of mana you spent to cast the creature is usually equal to its converted mana cost. However, you also include any additional costs you pay, including the cost imposed for casting your commander from the command zone.
* You can't choose to pay extra mana to cast a creature spell unless something instructs you to.
* If the creature enters the battlefield without being cast, no mana was spent to cast it. If the effect includes X, X will be 0.




---


**Cycle: Curses**


Introduced in the *Innistrad* set, Curses are a kind of Aura that enchant a player and have a negative effect. This release includes a cycle of Curses that cause something to happen when the enchanted player is attacked.



> ![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/e1GfMgVYzQ_EN.jpg)Curse of Predation  
> ![2 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150519185605im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)  
> 
> Enchantment—Aura Curse  
> 
> Enchant player Whenever a creature attacks enchanted player, put a +1/+1 counter on it.



* A Curse spell targets the player it will enchant like any other Aura spell, and a Curse stays on the battlefield like any other Aura. If the enchanted player gains protection from the Curse's color (or any other characteristic the Curse has), the Curse will be put into its owner's graveyard.
* Each of the Curses can be attached to any player, including the player who cast the Curse.
* Curse is an enchantment type, not a creature type (or any other kind of subtype).
* The ability won't trigger when a creature attacks a Planeswalker controlled by the enchanted player.
* The Curse subtype has no inherent rules meaning, but two cards in the *Innistrad* set (Bitterheart Witch and Witchbane Orb) refer to Curses.

### CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES



> ![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/z9CBbIuo76_EN.jpg)Act of Authority  
> ![1 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165508im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20160519004405im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20160519004405im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif)  
> 
> Enchantment  
> 
> When Act of Authority enters the battlefield, you may exile target artifact or enchantment.  
> 
> At the beginning of your upkeep, you may exile target artifact or enchantment. If you do, its controller gains control of Act of Authority.



* For either ability, if you are the only player who controls an artifact or enchantment, you must choose one of them as the target. However, you may choose to not exile it when the ability resolves.
* If you choose to not exile a permanent with the second ability, you'll retain control of Act of Authority.

> ![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/LFNWcwIevq_EN.jpg)Bane of Progress  
> ![4 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150525105735im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_4_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)  
> 
> Creature—Elemental  
> 
> 2/2  
> 
> When Bane of Progress enters the battlefield, destroy all artifacts and enchantments. Put a +1/+1 counter on Bane of Progress for each permanent destroyed this way.



* Bane of Progress's ability destroys all artifacts and enchantments, including those you control.
* If an artifact or enchantment isn't destroyed (perhaps because it has indestructible or it regenerated), it won't count toward the number of +1/+1 counters put on Bane of Progress. However, if an artifact or enchantment is destroyed but doesn't go to its owner's graveyard due to a replacement effect (like the one Rest in Peace creates), it will count.

> ![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/EKWJxOxQlI_EN.jpg)Curse of Chaos  
> ![2 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150519185605im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)![Red Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150518222449im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/red_mana.gif)  
> 
> Enchantment—Aura Curse  
> 
> Enchant player  
> 
> Whenever a player attacks enchanted player with one or more creatures, that attacking player may discard a card. If the player does, he or she draws a card.



* Curse of Chaos's ability will trigger only once per attacking player per combat phase, no matter how many creatures that player attacks with.




---



> ![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/e6pGkzXlBa_EN.jpg)Curse of Inertia  
> ![2 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150519185605im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)![Blue Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150519185605im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/blue_mana.gif)  
> 
> Enchantment—Aura Curse  
> 
> Enchant player  
> 
> Whenever a player attacks enchanted player with one or more creatures, that attacking player may tap or untap target permanent of his or her choice.



* Curse of Inertia's ability will trigger only once per attacking player per combat phase, no matter how many creatures that player attacks with.
* Even though the attacking player chooses the target of the ability, the ability is still controlled by the player who controls Curse of Inertia. Notably, a creature with hexproof controlled by the player who controls Curse of Inertia could be chosen, even though another player may be choosing the target.

> ![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/cmd13/EGrq3PXmrF_EN.jpg)Darksteel Mutation  
> ![1 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165508im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20160519004405im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif)  
> 
> Enchantment—Aura  
> 
> Enchant creature  
> 
> Enchanted creature is a 0/1 Insect artifact creature with indestructible and loses all other abilities, card types, and creature types.



* Darksteel Mutation has received minor errata to clarify its functionality. The updated Oracle wording appears above.
* Darksteel Mutation overwrites the printed power and toughness of the enchanted creature, as well as any characteristic-defining abilities that define power and/or toughness.
* Darksteel Mutation overwrites any previous effects that set the enchanted creature's power or toughness to a specific value. Any such effects that start to apply after Darksteel Mutation entered the battlefield will work normally.
* However, Darksteel Mutation does not overwrite effects that change the enchanted creature's power or toughness without setting it to a specific value (such as the ones created by Giant Growth or Glorious Anthem). It also won't overwrite the effect of counters.
* The enchanted creature will be only an artifact and a creature, not any other card types. It will be only an Insect, not any other creature types.
* In some rare cases, the creature may have subtypes other than creature types before becoming enchanted with Darksteel Mutation. If it had any other artifact subtypes (such as Equipment), it will retain those. If it had any subtypes other than artifact types and creature types (such as Shrine), it won't retain those.
* The creature will keep any supertypes it previously had. Notably, if Darksteel Mutation is enchanting a legendary creature, that creature will continue to be legendary. Also, if it's enchanting a commander, that creature will continue to be a commander.
* Darksteel Mutation doesn't affect the enchanted creature's colors, if any. It will continue to be whatever color or colors it was before Darksteel Mutation entered the battlefield.
* Darksteel Mutation causes the enchanted creature to lose all abilities except indestructible at the time it becomes enchanted. Any abilities the creature gains after that point will work normally.

* You can activate Derevi's last ability only when it is in the command zone.
* When you activate Derevi's last ability, you're not casting Derevi as a spell. The ability can't be countered by something that counters only spells. The ability isn't subject to the additional cost of casting commanders from the command zone.

* You don't have to control either target.
* If the same player controls both creatures when the ability resolves, nothing happens.
* If one of the creatures is an illegal target when the ability resolves, the exchange won't happen. If both creatures are illegal targets, the ability will be countered.

* The active player chooses a permanent first, followed by each other player in turn order. Each player will know what previous players have chosen when making his or her own choice. Then the doom counters are put on all the chosen permanents simultaneously.
* None of the permanents are targeted. A player can choose a permanent with protection from artifacts, for example.
* If a permanent with a doom counter isn't destroyed by Eye of Doom's last ability (perhaps because it has indestructible or it regenerated), the doom counter will remain on that permanent.

* The number of creatures each player controls is evaluated only as blocking creatures are declared. If, at that time, the defending player doesn't control the most creatures or isn't tied for the most, Hooded Horror can be blocked.
* Once Hooded Horror is blocked, it doesn't matter if the defending player controls the most creatures. The block won't be undone.

* Creatures that didn't attack during the combat phase when Illusionist's Gambit resolved aren't required to attack in the additional combat phase, although they may. Those creatures can attack you or a Planeswalker you control.
* If, during a player's declare attackers step, a creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack.
* If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack.

* If Jeleva leaves the battlefield, the exiled cards will remain exiled indefinitely. If Jeleva enters the battlefield again, it won't be associated with the cards the "other" Jeleva exiled. The new Jeleva will exile a new set of cards. Only those cards can be cast using Jeleva's last ability.
* If you cast an instant or sorcery card using Jeleva's last ability, you do so while that ability is resolving. If you choose not to (or you can't), you won't get a chance to cast it later unless the ability triggers again.
* When casting an instant or sorcery card this way, ignore all timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. However, you can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the card has ![X Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150421062918im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/X_mana.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.

* Marath, Will of the Wild has received minor errata. The text "X can't be 0" was inadvertently omitted from the card. The correct Oracle wording appears above.
* You announce the value of X as you activate the ability, and all instances of X in the activation cost are equal to the announced value.

* Mystic Barrier affects only what players and Planeswalkers each player may attack with creatures he or she controls. It doesn't affect what players may be targeted by spells or abilities or other interactions.
* Mystic Barrier doesn't affect creatures that enter the battlefield attacking.
* In some formats, you may need to disregard teammates sitting between you and the opponent seated nearest you in the chosen direction. In formats like Emperor, other rules may prohibit you from attacking that player.
* If two Mystic Barriers are on the battlefield with two different chosen directions, you may not attack a player or Planeswalker unless that player or the controller of that Planeswalker is the opponent seated nearest you in both directions. (This happens most often in two-player games.)

* Oloro's first ability works only if Oloro is on the battlefield.
* If Oloro is your commander, its last ability will trigger at the beginning of the upkeep step on your first turn.
* Oloro's second ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life is gained.
* You decide whether to pay ![1 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165508im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif) as the second ability resolves. If you do, you'll draw a card and each opponent will lose 1 life.
* If two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Oloro's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or Planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* In some unusual cases, you can gain life even though your life total actually decreases. For example, if you are being attacked by two 3/3 creatures and you block one with a 2/2 creature with lifelink, your life total will decrease by 1 even though you've gained 2 life. Oloro's second ability would trigger.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, lifegained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.

If you spend this mana to cast your commander, it enters the battlefield with a number of +1/+1 counters on it equal to the number of times it's been cast from the command zone this game.



* The "number of times it's been cast from the command zone" includes the most recent time. For example, the first time you cast your commander from the command zone in a game, if you spent mana from Opal Palace's last ability to do so, it will enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter.
* The color identity of your commander is set before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander is in a hidden zone (like the hand or library) or an effect changes your commander's color.
* If your commander is a card like Kozilek, Butcher of Truth, that has no colors in its color identity, Opal Palace's last ability produces no mana.

For example, say Serene Master is enchanted with Lightning Talons, which gives it +3/+0, and it blocks a 5/5 creature.

* Protection from a player is a new variant of the protection ability. It means the following:
	+ True-Name Nemesis can't be the target of spells or abilities controlled by the chosen player.
	+ True-Name Nemesis can't be enchanted by Auras or equipped by Equipment controlled by the chosen player. (The same is true for Fortifications controlled by the chosen player, if True-Name Nemesis becomes a land.)
	+ True-Name Nemesis can't be blocked by creatures controlled by the chosen player.
	+ All damage that would be dealt to True-Name Nemesis by sources controlled by the chosen player are prevented. (The same is true for sources owned by the chosen player that don't have controllers.)

* Spells and abilities that would cause a player to gain life still resolve, but the life-gain part has no effect.
* Abilities that trigger whenever a player gains life can't trigger and effects that would replace gaining life with another effect won't apply because it's impossible for players to gain life.
* If an effect sets a player's life total to a specific number and that number is higher than the player's current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than the player's current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
* To choose a target at random, all possible legal targets must have an equal chance of being chosen. There are many ways to do this, including assigning each possible legal target a number and rolling a die.
* The target is chosen at random as you put the last ability on the stack. Players can respond to this ability knowing who the target is.
* If you control Witch Hunt, you are not a legal target. If there are no legal targets available, the ability is removed from the stack and you retain control of Witch Hunt.
