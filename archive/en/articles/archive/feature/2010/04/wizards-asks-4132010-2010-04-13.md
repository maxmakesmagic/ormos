*What are you hoping to open at the Rise of the Eldrazi Prerelease?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** Unlike my answer about board sweepers a couple of weeks ago (I was talking about All Is Dust, by the way, as many of you guessed), I'll keep this fair and stick to [cards that have been previewed](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/riseoftheeldrazi/spoiler).

Tom LaPille has [already talked about](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/85b) my quest to cast Hand of Emrakul on turn three (which there are multiple ways to do, two that use only commons!). But that's not *one* card exactly.

I'm tempted to pick Mark Rosewater's [preview from yesterday](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/86), Broodwarden, which gives all my Eldrazi Spawn +2/+1. But smashing with a swarm of 2/2s will always be Plan B.

Ultimately, I've got to go with the biggest, craziest creature in *Rise of the Eldrazi*: Emrakul, the Aeons Torn.

Sure, it's the Prerelease card, so I'll walk away with at least one copy. Sure, it costs fifteen mana, so I might not even be able to cast it. But when I do, it is going to be unforgettable.

Have fun at the Prerelease!
