It was his first Top 8, and nobody was happier for Philippe Gareau than his roommate Pascal Maynard.

I caught Gareau just before the start of the quarters and asked for a quick run-down of the key points of his draft. It had started auspiciously with a mighty blue rare.


“Not only is [Niblis of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niblis+of+Frost) a great card, but I first-picked a blue rare in both my previous drafts today. There was no way I wasn't taking this one.” Second pick gave him [Smoldering Werewolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoldering+Werewolf) over the on-color [Wretched Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Gryff). “I think the Werewolf is the more powerful card, and I like Blue-Red. I'm not eager to take emerge cards without support.” He speculated on Emrakul's Boon third, then passed on a [Lashweed Lurker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashweed+Lurker) in favor of [Curious Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curious+Homunculus). “I hate Blue-Green. I won't draft it. At this point I was still hoping to be Blue-Red, and then I got the two [Geist of the Archives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+the+Archives). Unfortunately the red was getting cut.” He wound up in white on the strength of a late [Steadfast Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steadfast+Cathar) and [Spectral Reserves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Reserves).


His shift was rewarded in pack two where he was offered his choice between [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) and [Faith Unbroken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith+Unbroken), with more blue cards behind that might table. “It was a tough choice. [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) is absurd, I had two of them in my last draft, but ultimately I needed a way to deal with a creature that was already on the table.” He took a [Wretched Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Gryff) out of a relatively empty pack, then [Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Spirit) over [Subjugator Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subjugator+Angel). “I never want expensive spells. Six mana is a lot. With two [Geist of the Archives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+the+Archives) I'm going to be filtering lands to the bottom of my deck.” He got himself a pair of [Dawn Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Gryff)s and his deck was starting to take shape as a classic Blue-White Skies. Pack two closed out strong with a [Chilling Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chilling+Grasp) eleventh. “I was so happy to see that card. I needed it.”


The task for pack three was upping the aggression. “I needed to get rid of these Curious Homunculi because I wasn't going to be playing enough spells to justify them.” He started with [Sleep Paralysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleep+Paralysis), then got a gift of [Bygone Bishop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bygone+Bishop). A pair of Devilthorn Foxes jumped into his pile, along with an [Angelic Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Purge) and an [Explosive Apparatus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Apparatus) to help him control the board. “I was able to keep my curve low. I love playing aggressive tempo decks in this format, especially when I can go down to sixteen land.”


Three rounds stand between him and the trophy.
