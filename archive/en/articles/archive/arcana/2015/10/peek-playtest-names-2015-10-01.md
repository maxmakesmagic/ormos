 Yichao is a writer of words for plays, television, theme parks, and—most recently—Magic: The Gathering. He loves Cube Draft and corgis. 





In case you didn't know, when a set is in design, most cards have temporary playtest names that designers assign. These names rarely make it through the design process intact—and some playtest names are exceptionally silly on purpose!


Check out these playtest names for some *Battle for Zendikar* cards. Can you guess what cards they eventually turned into? (Hint: Some are basically impossible. All are fairly hilarious.) The answers are below the art.


1. Walking on the Ceiling
2. Indiana, Kor Explorer
3. Team High Five
4. Library Turtle
5. Inefficient Massacre
6. Gathering of Allies
7. Eldrazi Historian
8. Syncodrazi
9. Aggressive Gladeheart
10. Apple Tree
11. Odd Todd
