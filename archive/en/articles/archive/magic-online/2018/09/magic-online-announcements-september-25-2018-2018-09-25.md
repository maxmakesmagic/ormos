*Guilds of Ravnica* Coming September 27
---------------------------------------



*Guilds of Ravnica* is almost here! This means that we'll be rolling out some fun things on MTGO to celebrate starting September 27. That's right, a whole day early. We want you to have time to check out the cards before you head to your local prerelease! Check out [this article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/guilds-ravnica-magic-online-edition-2018-09-19) by Alli Medwin for details.

Targeting Icons
---------------



We're giving the targeting icons on *MTGO* a new look so it is easier to see what is targeting what or who. Check out [this article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/target-targeting-2018-09-25) by our client developer Christopher Bellach to see the process behind creating new icons, and how we did it!

*Core Set 2019* Redemption
--------------------------


M19 Regular redemption sets are currently out of stock and we will be starting the reprint process, which will take several weeks. We will announce the restock here the week before they are available. Thanks for your patience.

When we come up from downtime tomorrow, the Treasure Chests will be updated with new contents. Check out the bottom of the [announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/guilds-ravnica-magic-online-edition-2018-09-19) for the new full contents and change list.
