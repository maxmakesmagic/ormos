With roughly 4,000 players already preregistered for Grand Prix Las Vegas, this event is going to be the largest **Magic: The Gathering** event ever, blowing all expectations out of the water. While Cascade Games is excited to be running the largest **Magic** tournament ever, they are also aware that they must still provide an excellent experience for all who attend the event. With that in mind, Cascade Games has announced that it will cap the event size at 4,500 players to ensure the best possible experience.


Online preregistration was available through the [Cascade Games website](http://www.cascadegames.com/events/933). Players were highly encouraged to take advantage of online preregistration. Online preregistration remained open until 9 p.m. PT June 20, 2013, or until 4,400 players are preregistered, whichever came first.


It will allow Cascade Games to secure a minimum of 100 seats for players who have opted for on–site registration on Friday. On-site registration will start at 9 a.m. PT as announced previously and will be handled on a first-come, first-serve basis.


In the event some players may not be able to secure their seat in the Grand Prix, side event *Modern Masters* drafts will also be organized on-site.


If you are not going to be playing in Grand Prix Las Vegas, be sure to tune into the live web coverage at [twitch.tv/magic](/en/events/coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93amsterdam-standard-qualifier-season-top-8-decklists).
