What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Grand Prix Los Angeles Top 5 Moments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpla16/top-5-moments-2016-05-22) | Wizards of the Coast

Covering everything from a thirteen-year-old Top 8 competitor to the breakthrough of a mill deck to Fish winning the whole thing, [Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpla16) was quite the event. Relive the top moments with this article, or check out the [video replay of the event here](https://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball/v/67956720).


1. [Grand Prix Charlotte Top 5 Moments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcha16/top-5-moments-2016-05-22) | Wizards of the Coast

While [Grand Prix Charlotte](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcha16) was marred by some technological misfires (to put it lightly), it was still a tournament to remember. From Mike Sigrist dominating his second Grand Prix in a row to the crazy things [Boom // Bust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boom+%2F%2F+Bust) can do, to Sam Black's rampage to the Top 8 with [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow), it turned out to be a memorable tournament for more reasons than computers threatening our very existence once again.


1. [Bard "Jund Guy" Narson Goes to Charlotte ([15] Brad Nelson's Jund)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcha16/bard-narson-goes-to-charlotte-2016-05-21) | Wizards of the Coast | Jacob Van Lunen

This might just be the greatest deck tech ever written. That's all you need to know about this funny (and yet informative) look at Jund with Bard Narson, er, Brad Nelson.


1. [Intro to Momir Basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtafhLQl2eo) | The Mana Leek

Why Momir Basic? Why now?


Well, it turns out it's the format of choice for the [Community Super League](https://communitysuperleague.com/) this week, which virtually ensures some weird, wacky games. But it's also a weird, wacky format that not everyone is familiar with. For a format built around getting random creatures, there's a surprising amount of strategy and gameplay (that goes right out the window when you get [Eater of Days](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eater+of+Days)). This video will get you started.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Preparing for *Eternal Masters*: Five Budget(ish) Options for Legacy](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/preparing-for-eternal-masters-five-budget-ish-options-for-legacy) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Legacy cards can be a touch difficult to obtain, and that's why *Eternal Masters* exists. But, even before we start looking at the full *Eternal Masters* set to see what goodies we get (the full [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/eternal-masters) is out on Friday, but we have previews every day this week), SaffronOlive looks at some of the better options in Legacy for players who maybe can't get their hands on a ton of older cards.


1. [The Perils of ASAP](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13288&writer=Jadine+Klomparens&articledate=5-23-2016) | TCGPlayer | Jadine Klomparens

In today's *Magic* lesson, Jadine teaches us the art of patience in a *Magic* game and how, like in dating, making moves too soon can get us killed.


1. [The Four Metagames](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32970_The-Four-Metagames.html) | StarCityGames.com | Jennifer Long

Jennifer Long, aka Ms. Mulligan, joins the StarCityGames.com content lineup to talk about the four different kinds of metagames you can prepare for—and how to prepare for each one.


1. [Green-Blue Infect Is the Best Deck in Modern](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/bluegreen-infect-is-the-best-deck-in-modern/) | ChannelFireball | Owen Turtenwald

Bold claim, Mr. Turtenwald. Bold claim.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Congratulations to thirteen-year-old Ethan Brown for Top 8ing GP LA](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4kl1bp/congratulations_to_13_year_old_ethan_brown_for/)

It's true. At half the age of many of the other Top 8 competitors (and nearly a third the age of the oldest), Ethan Brown made it all the way to the finals of Grand Prix Los Angeles. We've had a few kids make runs, but this has to be one of the youngest going the furthest we've ever seen.


So there's another thing thirteen-year-olds are better than me at.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Grand Prix Los Angeles Champion](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpla16/top-8-decklists-2016-05-22)

Merfolk is always there. Hanging out. Putting up a Top 8 now and then. Running over the odd player unlucky enough to have Islands in play. But rarely is it the star.


After this weekend, Simon Slutsky put the fish permanently in the spotlight.


The deck, for the most part, is unchanged over the past few years. [Tidebinder Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) and [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) are the most recent additions, and neither of those are in Standard anymore.


So what changed? The format seemed ripe for it. Nahiri control, the newest hotness, can be soft to Merfolk (Islands plus Kira plus [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves)), and anyone trying to take advantage of newly unbanned [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) or [Sword of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek)/[Thopter Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Foundry) would find themselves drowning in Islandwalk.


But when across the country Merfolk didn't even place in the Top 8 at [Grand Prix Charlotte](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcha16), it's hard to say this represents the new world order. Instead, it represents the new normal in Modern: just about any one of a dozen decks can win on any given day.
