 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






Here’s what we have so far:


![Name To Come - 2WU - Instant - Remove target creature from the game and draw cards equal to its power. At the beginning of your next upkeep, return it to play and discard cards equal to its toughness.](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/ymtc3_nametocome.jpg)


The next step is to give this little card a name. And [last time we spoke](/en/node/624366), I asked all of you to submit names that tied all the elements of the card together. After poring through over *four thousand* entries we ended up with the following ten choices (hand selected by **Magic**’s very own Creative Team). You have until the site updates Sunday night to choose one of the following:


**What should the name of the card be?****A.** Astral Pilgrimage**B.** Astral Sojourn **C.** Dreamless Sleep**D.** Dust of Dreams**E.** Journey Through Dreams**F.** Somnomancy**G.** Tranceport**H.** Trial of Sands**I.** Vanish into Memory**J.** Wander in Dreams  
Please remember that the goal is to choose a name that you feel connects all the individual elements of the card. 

 As always, enjoy.
