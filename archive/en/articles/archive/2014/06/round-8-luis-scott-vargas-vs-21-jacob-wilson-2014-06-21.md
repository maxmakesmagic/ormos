[_metadata_:description]:- "Luis Scott-Vargas needs little introduction. This Hall of Famer has a staggering eleven grand prix top 8s including four wins and five pro tour top 8s including two wins.

A strong finish here at Grand Prix Chicago would certainly help his Pro Point total and put him in a better position to make Gold, or even Platinum status by the end of the year."

 Luis Scott-Vargas needs little introduction. This Hall of Famer has a staggering eleven grand prix top 8s including four wins and five pro tour top 8s including two wins. Despite being one of the most exceptionally skilled *Magic* players in the world, LSV has been having a difficult year. A strong finish here at Grand Prix Chicago would certainly help his Pro Point total and put him in a better position to make Gold, or even Platinum status by the end of the year.
