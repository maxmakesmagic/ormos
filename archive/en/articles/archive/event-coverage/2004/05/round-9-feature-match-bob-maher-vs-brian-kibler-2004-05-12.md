Bob Maher, the newly-appointed [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut), took his undefeated record into battle with Brian Kibler in Round 9. Maher's black-blue deck is nothing short of insane, loaded with removal, card advantage in the form of multiple [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)s and [Thieving Magpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Magpie), and all-around solid creatures. Kibler's red-white deck is also good, and luck gave him a [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) in the very last pack. Kibler's main deck [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma) (due to the five black drafters at the table) could blindside Bob. ### Game 1


![Seismic Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seismic+Assault)Kibler came out quick in Game 1 with [Canyon Wildcat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Wildcat) and [Ridgeline Rager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ridgeline+Rager). Bob dropped his Magpie and blocked Kibler's 2/1, losing the Bird to [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock). [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) brought the Pie back for more, but Kibler had [Pyrotechnics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrotechnics) for it the second time.


Maher went to work on Kibler's hand, first with a [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), then with a [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats) once Kibler was down to one card. That card? [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon).


"How's that taste?" asked Bob. Kibler said nothing, simply playing out the [Seismic Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Assault) he drew. Bob's next draw was better, however: a [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) that put the Magpie out for a third go-round.


Bob kept hitting with the Magpie and playing good spells--[Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), [Giant Cockroach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Cockroach), [Abyssal Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Specter). Kibler was twiddling his thumbs with just the [Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault) and a [Standing Troops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standing+Troops) (his [Aven Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Flock) was hit with [Dark Banishing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Banishing)--another platinum hit from Maher).


The tables turned when Kibler, still ahead in life 17-14, drew the [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma). Maher had been playing the card advantage game, and was clearly way ahead there, but hadn't really been trying to develop a potent board. Suddenly he found himself with 5 [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s in play facing down [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma) and [Seismic Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Assault).


Maher took five from [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma), attacked Kibler down to 12, then played [Primeval Shambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Shambler) and [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin). The race was on. Kibler played [Diving Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diving+Griffin) and had one card left--most likely a land.


Maher fell to 4 from the [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma) and then went for the throat. He [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon)ed the [Standing Troops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standing+Troops), [Vicious Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Hunger)ed the Griffin (going to 6), and attacked with everything, pumping the Shambler twice. That would be 12 damage, killing Kibler unless he had a land. Of course he did, and discarded it to kill the [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), surviving at two life.


But now Bob would not die to [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma)--the [Vicious Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Hunger) gave him a one-point cushion. Kibler needed to peel a land to win.


Hid did peel a landâ€¦ but he didn't win.


I guess he got excited, because as soon as his main phase began, he clicked on the [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) in his hand, and the [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) slid into play. Talk about your classic misclick.


Maher 1 - Kibler 0


### Game 2


The second game was very, very good, and I suggest watching the replay if you get the chance. It involved Bob [Coercion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coercion)ing the [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma) out of Kibler's hand, and then fighting through both [Circle of Protection: Black](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Black) and [Seismic Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Assault) to win the game. But as great a game as it was, it cannot hold a flame to the Kibler misclick. Neil Reeves, at the event as spectator, commented that this might now be remembered as the "Kibler Played a Land Invitational," and said that if Maher wins, he should ask to have Kibler sitting atop a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) worked into his card art somehow.


I'll leave you with the last bit of the chat log from that fateful Game 1:
