*What's your favorite Goblin of all time, and why?*

![Mons Johnson](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_MonsJohnson.jpg)**Mons Johnson:** Tough question, because there are so many good Goblins. And by good Goblins, I mean powerful ones! Not so much the ones that are nice and comforting ....

Once, playing in an Extended tournament, my opening hand consisted of a single Goblin card and six [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s. Needless to say, I won that game ... because the Goblin was [Goblin Recruiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter)!

I am a big fan of [Goblin Recruiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter). It won me more games than any other Goblin, because, well what can possibly be better than putting all your Goblins on the top of your deck?!

On the other hand I really like [Ib Halfheart, Goblin Tactician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ib+Halfheart%2C+Goblin+Tactician). He's the complete package. He's reasonably powerful, the art is superb, and the flavor text still amuses me to this day. So, we'll call it a draw. :)
