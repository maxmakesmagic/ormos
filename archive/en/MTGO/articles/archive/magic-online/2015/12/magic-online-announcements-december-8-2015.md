**Announcing January MOPR Promos**


The January MOPR period runs from December 30, 2015, through January 27, 2016. Here are the promo cards:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/DpA9wFU4aU.png)![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOPR_mother_of_runes_temp.jpg)

|  |
| Event Promo[Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage) | Store Promo[Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) |

Please note, these *Magic Online* promos will have the art shown above, but will use *Magic Online* expansion symbol and a *Magic Online* frame instead of the expansion symbol and frame shown.


Play in one or more events during the MOPR period, and you’ll get a non-premium [Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage). Five or more and you’ll get an additional premium [Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage). Spend at least $20 total in the *Magic Online* Store during this MOPR period, and you’ll get a non-premium [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes). By spending $40 or more, you’ll get an additional, premium, [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes).


And remember, this means it's your last chance to get the December MOPR promos, like this [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOPR_anticipate.png)
In the *Magic Online* Player Rewards (MOPR) program, *Magic Online* players are rewarded for participating in tournaments of a sufficient size, as well as making purchases in the *Magic Online* Store.

***Legendary Cube* and *Commander (2015 Edition)* Known Issues**


**Gameplay**


* Cardset | [Caged Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caged+Sun)’s mana ability incorrectly doesn't trigger when a land is tapped for an ability that produces more than one mana.
* Cardset | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability.
* Cardset | All legendary creature cards in all zones owned by a player who controls a [Heroes' Podium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) incorrectly receive the power/toughness bonus from its first ability.
* Cardset | [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi)'s ability does not cause creature cards to be exiled instead of being put into the graveyard.
* Cardset | [Myriad Landscape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)’s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield.
* Cardset | [Kurkesh, Onakke Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurkesh%2C+Onakke+Ancient) does not copy activated abilities of artifacts that sacrifice as part of their activation cost.
* Cardset | Cards cast with conspire that require a player to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast, such as [Life's Legacy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life%27s+Legacy) and [Momentous Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall), incorrectly look at the power and toughness of the last creature clicked for conspire.
* Cardset | [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)'s prompt box text incorrectly suggests that the caster must cast all appropriate exiled spells. This is a display issue only. The Cancel button allows the player to continue without casting remaining spells.
* Cardset | Copying [All Suns' Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) sometimes causes a crash.
* Cardset | Casting [Ray of Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command) without paying its mana cost, via a spell or ability such as cascade or [Mizzix's Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzix%27s+Mastery), incorrectly requires the player to pay the mana cost.
