Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. These days, he spends less time globetrotting around the world for Grand Prix and more time in Renton, WA, working as the organized play content specialist for Wizards of the Coast. 





Between the Sealed Draft and Standard Constructed portion of today, players were treated to a tour of the fourth floor of Wizards of the Coast after lunch. This is rarely something offered here at the headquarters, around two or three times each year for select groups of players for special events.


The 2015 Super Sunday Championship is one such occasion. While I can't give you the complete look inside Wizards of the Coast—something about secrets and ninjas and assassinated in my sleep and whatnot—I am able to give you a glimpse at portions of the tour. Enjoy!

*As you reach the end of the loop at the top of the Wizards of the Coast building, the murals shift to the modern *Magic* look. Nicol Bolas looms near one of the largest meeting rooms on this floor.*

*But in the lobby features my favorite mural of the building: an incredible depiction that includes the realm of Nicol Bolas, Jace, and much much more.*
