And then there's [Ascendant Evincar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascendant+Evincar), which depicts Crovax after he's become the evincar of Rath. But that's not all the cards that depict this former *Weatherlight* crewman's bloody history -- not even close.![enfeeblement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=enfeeblement)[Enfeeblement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enfeeblement) shows Crovax despairing over his betrayal by [Selenia, Dark Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selenia%2C+Dark+Angel).![Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Slaughter)[Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter) shows him killing [Mirri, Cat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirri%2C+Cat+Warrior) soon after becoming a vampire.![Death Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Death+Stroke)[Death Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Stroke) shows Crovax slaying Selenia in revenge, sealing his doom and fulfilling his curse.![Gerrard's Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gerrard%27s+Verdict)And [Gerrard's Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Verdict) depicts [Gerrard Capashen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard+Capashen) killing the now cruel and genocidal evincar Crovax.There are plenty more.
