Newsletter and Sign-up
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/newsletter_aug_2013.png)
The **Magic Online**  Newsletter contains a wealth of personalized information you can't find anywhere else. Published monthly, the newsletter is a quick snapshot of your **Magic Online**  history, and a top news and announcements list of info you shouldn't miss.
In each issue you'll find personalized stats, such as:
* A lifetime total of booster packs you've won
* MOPR promo cards you've earned through both store and event activity
* Current MOCS season qualifier points
* A personalized factoid

The factoid is a very cool feature that gives you a look at your play habits and choices from a data perspective. For example, a recent factoid listed your three most underdrafted common cards from ***Magic**  2014*. These factoids might surprise you, or even inspire new thinking or suggest new strategies.

[Weekly Articles on MTGOnline.com](/en/articles/archive/2013-07-12-0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------


[Top](#top)

Every Monday we publish a new article on [MTGOnline.com](http://www.mtgonline.com). This is where you will find all the details and schedules for big events, like the upcoming [Face the Hydra Challenge](/en/articles/archive/heros-path-standard-format-and-face-hydra-challenge-2013-09-23-0)  and the [*Theros*  Championships](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-theros-championships-2013-10-07-0).


From time to time, a member of the **Magic Online**  R&D team will stop by and take us behind-the-scenes to explain an aspect of the huge system that is **Magic Online**. Most recently, Jon Loucks offered a look at the some of the processes and challenges the team tackled while [bringing the new card set *Theros*  to **Magic Online**](/en/articles/archive/putting-rd-theros-2013-09-30-0).


You're also going to find articles on the future of **Magic Online**  here, too. We're always working on **Magic Online**, squashing bugs, providing live support in-game, and participating in events alongside players (check out this [year's Community Cup](/en/articles/archive/can-you-defeat-wizard-2013-08-26-0)  as an example). But we're also mapping out the future of **Magic Online**, assessing the big picture--the familiar places we've been, and the envelope-pushing places we want to go. For example, Chris Kiritz recently brought us up-to-speed on the [status of the Wide Beta Client](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-wide-beta-update-2013-10-08-0), including the important move to bring in external resources to help address game stability, plans for **Magic Online**  leagues, and a look ahead to the official release and change over to the new client.

If you're looking for a weekly digest of what's happening in **Magic Online**, the [**Magic Online**  Announcements](http://community.wizards.com/group/magic-online/blog)  on the new community site is the one-stop-shop you need. It collects upcoming event info, **Magic Online**  Store product changes and new set releases, and changes to the Banned and Restricted List. You'll also learn about the next promo cards for [**Magic Online**  Championship Series (MOCS)](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/12182012c) seasons, [**Magic Online**  Player Rewards(MOPR)](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=magic/online/rewards/welcome) and [Thursday Night **Magic Online**  (TNMO)](http://www.wizards.com/magic/digital/magiconline.aspx?x=mtg/digital/magiconline/calendar/2013#thursdaynightmagiconlinetnmo). For example, the new promo card for MOCS Season 11, Scrubland, and the October MORP promo cards, [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and [Nighthowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nighthowler) were revealed in the [September 24 announcements](http://community.wizards.com/content/blog/3933556).


One of the valuable pieces of information you'll find in the Weekly Announcements is downtime and release notes for **Magic Online**  and its clients. When bugs are fixed, or if there are issues we're currently working on, these can be found here. Use the Wednesday downtime notes to plan ahead for extended downtimes and possible client updates that requires a download.


[The **Magic: The Gathering**  community site](http://community.wizards.com/magic-the-gathering), where the Weekly Announcements live, is also a great resource for players. You'll find a variety of topics being discussed, and it's a great place to engage with other players outside of a competitive match.
