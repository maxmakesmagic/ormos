**Shahar Shenhar, World Champion Two Years Running:** [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai). I think any deck with access to blue and white will want it, and Blue-Black Control may splash for it. It conveniently survives a [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate).

**Patrick Chapin, Pro Tour *Journey Into Nyx* Champion:** [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent). It's a very efficient creature and exactly what a number of decks were looking for.
