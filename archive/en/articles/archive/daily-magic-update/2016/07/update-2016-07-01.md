The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 1, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by freedom. Also the Fourth of July, which is a holiday in the United States. As such, there will be no Daily Update on Monday, but there will be plenty of previews. We'll publish the rest of our articles—including the next episode of Access *Magic*—slightly later here on DailyMTG (8:30 a.m. PST, about 45 minutes later than our content normally shows up) while we enjoy our three-day weekend.


Today's Previews
================


Throughout preview season, I'll use this space to highlight the day's previews that can't be found on DailyMTG. Worried you might miss something? We'll make sure to have it here.


1. PureMTGO drops two cards!

PureMTGO, by pure luck and my lack of reading comprehension skills, had two cards to show off today, both with a touch of Eldrazi flavor. Check out a [Werewolf that might be Pauper-ready](http://puremtgo.com/articles/eldritch-moon-spoiler-ulvenwald-captive), plus, [baptism by Emrakul](http://puremtgo.com/articles/state-program-july-1st-2016).


1. [Hareruyamtg.com](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/category/detail/2971)

Previewed yesterday (so you can see it in the [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/eldritch-moon) if Japanese isn't your strong suit), but also today because of time zones, Hareruyamtg.com previewed a terribly interesting card, one that's received a bit of attention for its Eternal format applications.

Our friends in China previewed Stromkirk Occultist (yes, that's the English name) just last night. You can check out a translation on [the Reddit thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4qpx0i/emn_can_anyone_translate_this_spoiler/).


1. [*EMN* Previews!](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snacktimewithmikeandant-07012016-snack-time-35-emn-previews/) | Snack Time with Mike and Ant | Mike Linnemann and Ant Tessitore

Flavor previews, we've got your flavor previews here! Mike and Ant share a pair of exciting reprints with awesome updated flavor for an increasingly mad Innistrad.


1. [Field Research](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/emmahandy-07012016-field-research/) | Gathering Magic | Emma Handy

Things have been pretty dark this week as we've explored Emrakul's madness spreading across Innistrad. But today, for the first time, do we see a bit of—hope? Is that what the word is? I seem to have forgotten it. But maybe this is a ray of sunshine coming in. Could this mean a turning of the tides? I'd check back for next week's previews to see the answer.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* Sunset Show](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-343-shadows-over-innistrad-sunset-show/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Kenji Egashira

With Luis Scott-Vargas's child coming just a few days ago, you're going to be seeing a lot of pinch hitters across the web for one of the most prolific content creators around. Here, you get Kenji Egashira discussing moving away from *Shadows over Innistrad*–focused Limited alongside Marshall. It'll have to do.


(We love you Kenji—and [congratulations](#nine)!


1. [Luis Revisits the Best Game He's Ever Been a Part Of](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/luis-revisits-the-best-game-hes-ever-been-a-part-of/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas and Marshall Sutcliffe

This has nothing to do with *Eldritch Moon*, but this is cool enough to override that. In fact, it's one of the most interesting pieces of content I've seen in a while. I'll admit my interest is piqued because it's a match that features basically all of my favorite cards of all time—[Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), [Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum), [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), and [Esper Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm)—and results in an incredibly exciting match and sequence at the end. This was before I was on Pro Tour coverage, but I fondly remember watching this very match from home. It's incredibly interesting, exciting *Magic*, and I highly recommend watching this matchup between two Hall of Fame pros (Gabriel Nassif and LSV) playing two all-time great Standard archetypes—Five-Color Cruel Control and Black-White Tokens.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [Magic Madhouse Pro Series Grand Finale](https://www.magicmadhouse.co.uk/pro-series-blackpool-i76)

The culmination of the Magic Madhouse Pro Series takes place this weekend, and there's a [snazzy trophy on the line](https://twitter.com/magicmadhouse/status/748448621260079105)! The event, which features Standard on Saturday and Modern on Sunday, will be broadcast on [twitch.tv/magicmadhouse](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmadhouse) all weekend. British accents guaranteed. Sad Brexit jokes likely.

================


1. [Craig Wescoe starts brewing](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13364&writer=Craig+Wescoe&articledate=7-1-2016)

Instead of one deck today, I'm going to leave you with this article by Craig Wescoe on TCGPlayer that starts brewing in earnest for some of the exciting cards we've seen this weekend. He's got [Triskaidekaphobia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskaidekaphobia) and Tree of Perdition, Elder Deep-Fiend (not "fried") and [Kozilek's Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return), Lone Rider and [Soul Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden), plus Thalia, Heretic Cathar and basically everything.
