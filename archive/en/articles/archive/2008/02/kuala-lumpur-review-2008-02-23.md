The calendar says 2008, but it seemed like 1998 all over again. Hall of Famer Jon Finkel steamrolled the field at [Pro Tour窶適uala Lumpur](/en/events/coverage/magic-back) en route to his third career PT championship, coming nearly 10 years after his first victory. It marked the 12th Pro Tour Top 8 of Finkel's career and the first since 2003.


Podcaster Richard Hagon pulled double duty in Kuala Lumpur. Along with his regular audio coverage, Rich filled in for Randy Buehler on the Tournament Center video segments and the Sunday Top 8 webcast. A regular member of the coverage team at Pro Tours and European Grand Prix, Hagon brings the game to your computer like no one else. His blend of storytelling, news gathering, and analysis gets to the heart of the game while still remaining accessible and inviting to **Magic**  players who aren't regulars on the tournament scene. Listen in as Hagon boils down the three days of Pro Tour窶適uala Lumpur into these highlight clips.
