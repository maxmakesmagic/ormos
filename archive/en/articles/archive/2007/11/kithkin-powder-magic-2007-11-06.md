As Jeremy Jarvis [described](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/423) earlier on this site, part of the look and feel of kithkin was established through the look of their magic. Kithkin use a lot of powders and dusts to perform their spellcraft, which in turn necessitates a lot of containers—urns, jars, lockets, and pouches. Check out this image from the *Lorwyn* style guide for a look at some of the equipment kithkin might use to carry their magical materials.

It's part bird, part pottery! The mage's wind-defying power comes from the powders he has stoppered up in all those jars and urns.

The versatile removal power of [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) all comes down to a circle of fine particles, shown here trapping a frustrated flamekin in its center.

A circle of powder can have healing properties, too. Below, a [Kithkin Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Healer) nurses a young kithkin back to health with an inscribed pattern made from specially-prepared dust.
