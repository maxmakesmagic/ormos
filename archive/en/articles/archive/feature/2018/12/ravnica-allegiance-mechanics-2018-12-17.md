Good news, Planeswalker! Even though tensions are ramping up, Ravnica hasn't descended into total chaos yet. A few months ago, *Guilds of Ravnica* gave us a look at five of the ten guilds, and *Ravnica Allegiance* rounds out the group by featuring Orzhov, Gruul, Simic, Azorius, and Rakdos. Even if your chosen guild has stepped out of the spotlight this time around, there are great cards in all colors, not to mention powerful artifacts and lands.


Each guild has its own signature mechanic, and this article gives you a first look at how they play. Let's dive in!


The Cult of Rakdos and Spectacle
================================

Nobody makes it clear that the populace isn't going to control itself quite like the Cult of Rakdos. They are showmanship, violence, and anarchy blended into a chaotic smoothie. It's time to drink up, kids. The spectacle is here.

*Spectacle*, the new Rakdos keyword, gives spells an alternative cost. You can cast a spell for its spectacle cost if an opponent lost life during the turn. On some cards, the alternative cost is a discount, a reward for hurting your opponents. For other cards, such as Rix Maadi Reveler and Rafter Demon, the spectacle cost is higher, but there's an additional reward for paying that cost. Paying a spectacle cost is always optional, even if an opponent lost life that turn.


There are several ways for an opponent to lose life. Damage causes loss of life, as well as effects that have an opponent lose life directly. In addition, if an opponent pays life for any reason during a turn, that also counts. If their life total went down during the turn, they lost life. Note that the opponent could also gain life in the same turn, but that doesn't stop you from casting a spell for its spectacle cost. For example, if an opponent starts at 12 life, is dealt 3 damage, and later gains 5 life all in the same turn, your spectacle costs are a go.


Spectacle itself doesn't change when you can cast a spell. Just because an opponent loses life on their turn, it doesn't mean you can cast either of the two barrels of fun pictured above. As creatures without flash, they're confined to your main phase unless something else says otherwise.


Even if you pay a spectacle cost, the mana cost and converted mana cost of the spell don't change. Rix Maadi Reveler's converted mana cost is 2, either way you pay. It also doesn't matter how much life the opponent lost or even how many opponents lost life. The spectacle cost remains the same.


If the Rakdos love anything, it's ticket sales, so sharpen your knives and make sure your insurance is up to date. The circus is in town.
