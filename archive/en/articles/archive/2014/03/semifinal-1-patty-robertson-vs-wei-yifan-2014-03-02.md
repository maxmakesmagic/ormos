Both players have successfully piloted their Esper control decks to the semifinals, bagging themselves a healthy prize check, a handful of Pro Points as well as the much-coveted invitation to Pro Tour Journey to Nyx in the process. This also meant that at least one Esper control deck would make it to the finals and both players would need to outplay the other if they wished to advance further.


**Game One**  


 


 


After throwing back his initial seven, Wei found himself stuck on two Islands but had just enough mana to stop Robertson's [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) with [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate). After cycling [Quicken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicken), he managed to draw a crucial [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment), allowing him to scry into two successive Plains.


 


 


 


When Robertson baited out [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) using [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), that gave him free reign to slam [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) onto the battlefield, prompting an instant concession from Wei. Even in a deck stacked with solutions, it was not possible to come back from this dire situation.

**Game Two**


 


 


 


Wei went on the offensive and ran out [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) over two successive turns. However, Robertson was at the ready with [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) and [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve).


 


 


 


Upon reaching six mana, Robertson presented his own copy of Jace and Wei allowed it to resolve, preferring to draw three cards using [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). He untapped to plop [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) onto the table, leaving two mana up for [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay).  [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) would not be easy to deal with post-board, for a couple of [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)s have surely been boarded out, and Wei pummeled at his opponent's life total four by four.


 


 


 


Robertson had [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to access Wei's grip of cards, currently consisting [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling), [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay) and [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve). After a few moments of deliberation, Robertson decided to remove [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve).


 


 


 


Nothing else resolved for a few turns thereafter, with [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)s and [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve)s stopping all the crucial spells. Now that both players were out of countermagic, Robertson restocked his hand with a [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for six new cards, and proceeded to drop Elspeth, protecting it against [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) with yet another [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay).


 


 


 


With Wei holding two utterly useless [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)s, he watched as Robertson's horde of Soldier tokens and [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) flood the board. Despite gaining a bunch of life from the [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa), that did not stop him from extending his hand as Robertson eventually ravaged through his life total.
