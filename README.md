# ormos

Ormos is an archive of the missing daily Magic: The Gathering website content from the distant past to the present which got lost over website moves.

## How do I find an article?

You can:

- browse the [archives](/archive) directly
- look up articles by [author](by-author)
- try Github search
- or clone the repository and use a file search tool.

## You don't have _very important article_!

This archive is currently a work-in-progress - please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/maxmakesmagic/ormos/issues) and I'll see whether I can prioritise that article if it's been scraped.

## _article_ is all messed up / looks funny / is broken!

These articles were translated automatically using custom scripting from scraped versions of the Wizards website - it's very possible something's gotten lost along the way. Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/maxmakesmagic/ormos/issues) and I'll look into whether the problem can be solved programmatically or not.
