*What's your favorite land in **Magic**?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** Some people might give it a bad rap, but what nobody appreciates is that [Sorrow's Path](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorrow%27s+Path) is actually—

![Sorrow's Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sorrow%27s+Path)  
Ha, no, just kidding. [Sorrow's Path](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorrow%27s+Path) is neck and neck with [Wood Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wood+Elemental) on the Worst Cards Ever list. As for my actual favorite? Honorable mentions go to [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth) for powering up so many things, [Gods' Eye, Gate to the Reikai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods%27+Eye%2C+Gate+to+the+Reikai) for its charm, [Zoetic Cavern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zoetic+Cavern) for sheer weirdness, and [Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunhome%2C+Fortress+of+the+Legion), for enabling many, many extra points of damage to be dealt.

But the favorite slot has to go to [Mosswort Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge), and to a lesser extent its cyclemates, including [Windbrisk Heights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Heights) and [Spinerock Knoll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinerock+Knoll).

I once saw director of **Magic** R&D Aaron Forsythe cast a [Nova Chaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser) and piggyback off its 10 power to pop out a [Deepfire Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepfire+Elemental) from underneath [Mosswort Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge) for the [Nova Chaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser) to champion—and that kind of craziness is pretty typical when you can cast a spell for free at instant speed.
