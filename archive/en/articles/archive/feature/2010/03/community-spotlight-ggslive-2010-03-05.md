[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/act400_ggslive.jpg)](http://www.ggslive.com/)There's a new kid in town, if "kid" means "web site" and "town" means "world of event coverage." ggslive.com (short for "Good Games Live," if that helps you pronounce it) has been providing its own video coverage of events. And now seems like as good a time as any to mention them, since they've got the Midwest Masters Series this weekend.


The [Midwest Masters Series Open](http://www.magicmastersseries.com/node/5) this weekend is in Minneapolis, and the video coverage will be on [ggslive.com](http://www.ggslive.com). Check them out!
