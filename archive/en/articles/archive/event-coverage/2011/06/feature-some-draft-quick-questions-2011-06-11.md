***1) About how high would you pick Porcelain Legionnaire and Thundering Tanadon?*** 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Porcelain Legionnaire
 | 
Thundering Tanadon
 |

**Paul Rietzl:** I don’t think I’ve ever had either of those in any of my decks. I want to try to be blue/black at all times. I guess the Legionnaire’s all right, but as far as I’m concerned, my opponents can play their Tanadons against me all day long.


**Kazuya Mitamura:** I don’t really like either.


**Lukas Jaklovsky:** The Legionnaire is like a second pick or so and the Thanadon is like seven. I don’t really like it.


**Lucas Florent:** The Legionnaire could be a first pick in a really light pack, but it’s usually like second or so. The Tanadon is usually like five, six, or seven.


***2) If you’re drafting infect, what two colors would you generally like to be?*** 


**Shuhei Nakamura:** Only green-black.


**Yuuya Watanabe:** Blue-black.


**Jonas Köstler:** Black-green. Green has the best creatures and black has proliferate.


**Gaudenis Vidugiris:** Green-black—they have all the good cards.


***3) So...Hexplate Golem: Thumbs up or thumbs down?*** 


**Paul Rietzl:** I am not a big fan of the Hexplate.


**Yuuya Watanabe:** Ehhhh, thumbs down.


**Jonas Köstler:** Thumbs up.


**Gaudenis Vidugiris:** Thumbs downish. It’s solid if you have a Treasure Mage, and I guess if you have a Grand Architect. Or if your deck just doesn’t have anything and needs a way to win.


***4) Will you play Parasitic Implant?*** 


 


![Parasitic Implant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Parasitic%20Implant&options=)

 

**Shuhei Nakamura:** Yeah, I’ll play it. It’s one of the cheapest black removal spells in the set. I’ll play one, but two is too much.


**Lukas Jaklovsky:** I guess I would.


**Lucas Florent:** Yes I would.


**Kazuya Mitamura:** I think it’s playable but slow.
