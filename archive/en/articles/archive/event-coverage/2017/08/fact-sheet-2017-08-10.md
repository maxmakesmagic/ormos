FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
--------------------



* [Format](#-tabs-1)
* [Structure](#-tabs-2)
* [Judges & Notes](#-tabs-3)

* [Modern Constructed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern)
* Deck lists are required
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* All players with an X-3-0 record (or better) advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**

Pro Points earned at this event count toward the *Ixalan* cycle for the Pro Tour Players Club.









Byes
----


Grand Prix tournament byes can be earned either through a player's yearly [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/Information) total or by winning a Grand Prix Trial.


Byes earned through Planeswalker Points are calculated using the Planeswalker Point totals from all reported events as of the Tuesday immediately before the Grand Prix. Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix.


Winners of a Grand Prix Trial tournament are awarded two byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds. For complete information about Grand Prix byes and their corresponding competitive season, please check the [*Magic: The Gathering* Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents/244).


#### Third Round Byes

Side Events
-----------


Along with the main event, there are additional side-event tournaments to play in at a Grand Prix. The Side Events listed in this section are on the schedule of every Grand Prix. For a more robust listing of side events, visit the Grand Prix website. Side events at a Grand Prix have a 3x Planeswalker Points multiplier (or whichever multiplier is appropriate for the event type).


#### Friday


**Last-Chance Trials**  

Earn a valuable Two-Round bye by winning one of the Last-Chance Trials. These are 32-person single-elimination events, starting as soon as 32 players register.


**"Foiled Again"**  

A straight Swiss tournament lasting three or four rounds. Participants get one past promo card for playing, then one additional promo card per match win. Format varies by event.


#### Saturday


**"Rebound" Event**  

Format at organizer's discretion. Players who also played in the main Grand Prix tournament will get a discount for entry.


#### Sunday


**Pro Tour Qualifier**  

The winner of the Pro Tour Qualifier receives an invitation to the same Pro Tour that the Grand Prix feeds. The format depends on the format of the Grand Prix: if the Grand Prix is Limited, the Pro Tour Qualifier will be Standard; otherwise the format of the Pro Tour Qualifier will be Limited. The Pro Tour Qualifier will consist of either an eight-round Swiss tournament with a maximum of 225 players, or eight single-elimination pods of 32 players each; in either case, a Top 8 single-elimination playoff will take place.








Artists
-------


Some of the hottest and most famous artists in *Magic* will be joining us at the Grand Prix. All artists will be available to sign cards, playmats, and more.
