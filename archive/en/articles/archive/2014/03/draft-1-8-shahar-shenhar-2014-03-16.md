Reigning World Champion Shahar Shenhar is looking to kickstart a year that feels like a sophomore jinx. Despite middling finishes at both Pro Tours, Shenhar hasn't lost his killer instinct, and his spirit remains high. I sat in on his first draft of the day, where his 7-2 record meant he needed a 3-0 to have a shot at Top 8.

*Shahar Shenhar* 
 


Things started off auspiciously. His first pack served up [Akroan Skyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard), the set's marquee common. Then came [Glimpse the Sun God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God), one of the best uncommons for aggressive heroic decks, and then a [Nyxborn Shieldmate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Shieldmate), an ideal turn-three play in a deck full of two-drops. Fourth pick he dipped into a second color for [Asphyxiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate) in a pack whose only other notable card was [Archetype of Imagination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Imagination). "I don't like Archetype at all. [Asphyxiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate) is a good signal that black is open, and I don't mind playing aggressive black-white. In Triple-*Theros* draft black-white was usually a control deck, but *Born of the Gods* gives you a lot of strong early plays."


 


The white cards seemed to dry up and Shenhar took [Odunos River Trawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odunos+River+Trawler) fifth followed by [Fearsome Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fearsome+Temper) over [Weight of the Underworld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weight+of+the+Underworld). "I'm not committed to black-white at this point. I know I'm white. Temper is great in red-white. [Weight of the Underworld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weight+of+the+Underworld) is not good, and if I do wind up playing black I'll have chances at other inefficient removals like [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip)." A seventh pick [Elite Skirmisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher) was a good sign that white was the place to be, and the pack wrapped up with some filler cards.


"At the end of pack 1 I'm still open. I have a core of very good white cards, with a late [Elite Skirmisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher) as a signal that white will be open pack three. I could still end up white-green, white-red or white-black."

Pack two didn't start off the way Shenhar had hoped. His opening pack had [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) in white, a fine pick but nothing to get excited about, and three great blue cards: [Ordeal of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa), [Thassa's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary) and [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide). "I can't take a blue card there. Blue's the one color I know isn't open." Next up was a pack with [Boon of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Erebos), [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Spearpoint Oread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearpoint+Oread) and [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict). "Again, I'd rather take a fine white card I'm sure I'll play than something in another color. [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) is hardly a bomb, just a solid card."


 


 


Third pick he considered five cards: [Sentry of the Underworld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentry+of+the+Underworld), [Ill-Tempered Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ill-Tempered+Cyclops), [Chosen by Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod), [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos), and [Titan's Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Strength). "Here I took [Chosen by Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod). My thinking is, if I take Scholar and wind up white-red, that'll be bad. If I take Chosen I can see what comes around." It paid off, as both Scholar and Sentry made the lap. Shahar took the Sentry.


It hadn't started well, but pack two coughed up a series of winners. [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught), followed by [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider), and then [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite). Shenhar also got late [Lagonna-Band Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder) and [Setessan Battle Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Battle+Priest). This was good, as he was long on spells and short on creatures. "I knew going into pack that I had to prioritize creatures, even with those late pickups."


Pack 3 should have been a windfall for Shenhar after the setup in the first pack. First up was a pack with no good white cards besides the legendary [Anax and Cymede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anax+and+Cymede). I asked Shenhar of this was a tough pick.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anax+and+Cymede)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anax+and+Cymede)
"Even at this point, I don't have to play black. I have a few black cards, but my white is good enough that I can afford to switch, especially for a card as powerful as [Anax and Cymede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anax+and+Cymede)." Next he took [Arena Athlete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena+Athlete) over [Leonin Snarecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster), the only white creature in the pack. It was more a calculated risk than a full commitment to red. "This was pretty straightforward. If I take the Snarecaster, there's absolutely no way the Athlete comes back. This way I get a shot at two creatures. The risk is worth it even if I abandon red. But I probably won't"


That was the end of the real decisions. The remaining packs were dismal, and Shenhar could only shake his head as he collected underwhelming curve-fillers like [Satyr Rambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Rambler) and [Anvilwrought Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor). Still, he was optimistic.


"Obviously pack three was the worst. I'm playing a few suboptimal cards, but I've got fifteen creatures and my spells are great. It sucks having to play [Griffin Dreamfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Dreamfinder) but even that can get an early [Fearsome Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fearsome+Temper) if I get blown out."


It wasn't the deck he'd hoped for, but he figured that 3-0 was still a real possibility.
