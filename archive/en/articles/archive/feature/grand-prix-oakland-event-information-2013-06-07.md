[ChannelFireball.com](http://www.channelfireball.com/) proudly presents Grand Prix Oakland! 

 A short trip across the bay from San Francisco and the hometown of Pro Tour champion Luis Scott-Vargas, Oakland plays host to its third Grand Prix. The weekend will feature special events for every kind of **Magic** competitor—from the casual player to the top-level professional. In addition, three **Magic** artists and a dozen of the largest vendors from around the country will be on hand to fill your every **Magic** need! 

 Never experienced a Grand Prix? No problem! There will be a free instructional seminar Friday afternoon with [Team ChannelFireball](http://www.channelfireball.com/) members LSV and Ben Stark to prepare you for the main event. Team members will also be gunslinging ***Magic** 2014*  Sealed Deck throughout the weekend to help you hone your skills. All this and more will make Oakland the perfect event to experience your first Grand Prix! 

  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

* Deck lists are required.
* If product is not stamped or preregistered, deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the Swiss Sealed Deck.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 matches will have no time limit.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

(For Grand Prix Oakland, the cutoff date will be August 21.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:

**Trial winners**
  
 Winners of a Trial tournament are awarded 2 byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds.
