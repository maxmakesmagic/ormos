Attentioooooon! And welcome to a budget week of ReConstructed!


This week, it's time to see how many soldier-based pop-culture references and puns I can fit into one ReConstructed article. Oh, and work on a pretty cool budget deck too.


Which deck? Oh yes. You absolutely read that right. *Soldiers.*

It's time to crank it like Soulja Boy, as we take a look at building a pretty neat, fun, and budget Standard deck.


Clamoring to see what we have to work with? All right...chin up, shoulders back. Let's see what we're made of!

Budget Rules
============


Ready to rush into the decklist? At ease, Soldier! First, let's cover my rules for building on a budget so we're all clear about what I'll be working on today.


Let's take a quick look at my general rules for budget deck building:



* I will not add any new rares or mythic rares to the decklist. I'd rather make the deck extra budget-y and then let you season to taste with delicious rares than cook it so rare you won't eat it at all.
* The one exception to the above is mana fixing. You'll get a lot of mileage out of acquiring a mana base: lands can go in many decks and are one of the crucial elements. Your cards probably aren't going to help you if you can't cast them!
* I try not to make substitutions. Budget doesn't need to mean making a worse version of a current deck—it just means building toward an archetype that has easier-to-obtain cards. Cards like [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) and [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) simply can't be replaced in decks that need them.
* Budget doesn't mean bad. I'm not setting out to make a deck we know will be suboptimal through this process. There have been plenty of highly successful low-rare decks throughout *Magic*'s history, and there are certainly ways to follow in their footsteps.

If you want more explanation on any of those points, check out the beginning of [my first budget article](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/205).


Now, with that down, it's time to move on...just like anybody thinking about making another Rambo movie. Let's roll out!


The Battle Plan
===============


So, what is going on here?


This deck is an aggressive White Weenie strategy at its core, augmented by some light green touches like [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales). It aims to hit hard and finish off the opponent before he or she can get too much rolling.


But a real interesting part of this deck is the Soldier subtheme. It takes advantage of [Preeminent Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preeminent+Captain). There aren't exactly a lot of [Soldier tribal cards in Standard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+[%22Soldier%22]&format=+[Standard]) (if I was adding more rares, I would also consider [Obelisk of Urd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Urd))—but this one packs a punch. Any time you can put free creatures onto the battlefield *and* let them attack right away, that's something to pay attention to! It's time to wipe some dirt off your Soldiers.


There isn't a lot of subtlety here—and that's okay. There are still places to reevaluate and tweak.


The keys to improving this deck are going to be finding the best Soldiers for it to play with and reevaluating its spell mix. Are those spells the kind of thing that this deck wants?


Well, I suppose it's time to march on toward working on the deck. Let's go!


Deck Breakdown
==============


Which cards are worth bringing into the platoon and which are going to get cut from the squad? Let's run through each card, one by one, and determine what's worth keeping around.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Preeminent Captain)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preeminent Captain)
**Preeminent Captain**


As just described, this is our Soldier tribal enabler. While there aren't any Emrakul-sized Soldiers hanging out to just slam onto the battlefield, this deck plays out like a beatdown deck. And any extra speed, or what essentially amounts to "mana generation," is going to be quite welcome. We're definitely going to want to keep all of the copies of the soldier man...err, Kithkin here.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Abzan Falconer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan Falconer)
**Abzan Falconer**


It's not a Warrior for all of those Warrior decks you've drafted in *Khans of Tarkir*—but your Limited deck's loss is our gain, as [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer) being a Soldier finally pays off!


The Falconer hits three key axes of our deck: it's a Soldier, it interacts well with +1/+1 counters, and it's a useful creature on its own. Sending your creatures to the air is excellent in a deck mostly focused on the ground like this one, and slinging it down off of a [Preeminent Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preeminent+Captain) trigger provides quite the falcon punch! I definitely want to keep all four of these.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phalanx Leader)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx Leader)
**Phalanx Leader** 


This is a defining card for this deck. Whether or not you want to play [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) is a deceptively huge question.


On one hand, [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) provides this deck some of its craziest draws. You can kill on turn four with the Leader if you curve out and have [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) and enough ways to target the Leader. And if you have [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer) it even sends your team to the skies! That's pretty potent.


On the other hand, playing [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) commits you to a bunch of other cards. If you put the Leader in your deck, suddenly you need a bunch of cheap spells to target him. Before you know it, you're knee deep in sixteen one- and two-mana tricks.


The question really isn't solely *is [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) good*?—because in your good draws, he is *quite* good. The question is also *is supporting the Leader worthwhile*?


I could definitely see building it either way. But, in general, I would err on the side away from Leader. It really forces you to play a bunch of cards that are only okay instead of just more creatures to help with your curve. Let's go for not following the Leader here.


Instead, there is another card that makes for a pretty good fit.


In a world with [dual lands that gain you life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+[%22Land%22]&set=+[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&text=+[%22gain%22]+[%22tapped%22]) and [Radiant Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Fountain), [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate) suddenly looks a lot more attractive. Pair that with [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) to make him double-jump in size each time you gain life, and you really start getting somewhere! (Although it's not for this deck, you should see what happens when you have Pridemate and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) rolling!)


While the Pridemate also takes synergies to get him to work, his synergies can come from lands in the deck—which doesn't eat into our spell slots, unlike [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader). That makes me a lot happier looking at the big picture of our deck.


Conveniently a Soldier with 2/2 stats and room to grow, I'm going to for four [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate)s.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Paragon of New Dawns)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon of New Dawns)
**Paragon of New Dawns**


This is a pretty unique fit for this deck—you don't exactly see [Paragon of New Dawns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon+of+New+Dawns) running around Standard tables everywhere—but it actually accomplishes a few nice goals.


For one, it's a Soldier. Nice and on theme! It can snap right onto the battlefield with [Preeminent Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preeminent+Captain). And it's great you can do that, too, because this is an "anthem" effect that pumps your entire team! All of the creatures in this deck are white, meaning this makes all of your creatures better so you can hit extra hard. Although it does cost four mana, this is a good fit for this deck. I'd actually like to move up to the full four copies.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archetype of Courage)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype of Courage)
**Archetype of Courage**


As a 2-power first striker that makes your team better and is a Soldier, the Archetype is at least worth looking at. It's a little below the curve at its stats, but if it's going to win fights it could be worth it.


However, looking at this deck's creatures, I get less and less excited by the Archetype. Falconer can already fly pretty easily, and Captain has first strike already. While making your opponent's creatures lose first strike isn't useless, there isn't enough first strike to really say that's meaningful.


Instead, I'd rather trade [Archetype of Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Courage) for something with better stats that also works better with our curve: [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin). Like [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer), it's also a Soldier in a world of Warriors, and Bond-Kin's ability grants a group of your creatures first strike. The Bond-Kin can also grow and works well with [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales). That makes cutting the Archetypes and playing the full four Hounds a pretty easy switch for me. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hardened Scales)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened Scales)
**Hardened Scales** 


Although it isn't as maximized in this deck as in a  [really counter-heavy Abzan deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/rc/fistful-counters-2014-09-30), the Scales are still put to good use. [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales), well...*scales* well the more you have, making extra copies non-redundant. And in conjunction with something like [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate), it can really make your creatures out of control.


Also: It's just a really fun card.


I'm happy to stick with four here.



**Ajani's Presence, Defiant Strike, Feat of Resistance, and Ranger's Guile** 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/rc20141111_4cards.jpg)
With [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) gone, suddenly the deck doesn't really need any of these cheap, middling tricks. It can focus on playing one stronger card instead a bunch of these cards.


The one card that jumps out at me is [Reap What Is Sown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+What+Is+Sown). This spreads three counters, both pumping your team in combat and also turning on your [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin) and [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer)...and, oh yeah, being strong with [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) too. I'm happy to play four of those.


After that, I just want to plug gaps in what the deck is trying to do. I'm going to add in four copies of [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) as an answer to anything troublesome, and so you can just keep punching through. One of the big benefits of [Preeminent Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preeminent+Captain) is that it lets you tap out to kill your opponent's creature and still add pressure to the board. These kinds of cards take advantage of that. I'd rather have the versatility of [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) than [Devouring Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light), especially considering you can [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) to remove blockers before they can block and soak up some damage.


After that, I just want to fill a few spots on the creature side. There are enough counters floating around to make [Chronicler of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronicler+of+Heroes) a card you can play. You don't want a ton of it, but when it "cantrips" (meaning it draws you a card) it's good and keeps your hand stocked for the Captain.


The final card I want is two copies of [Loyal Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loyal+Pegasus). This deck is just missing a one-drop, and although [Sunblade Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblade+Elf) is an option, I don't plan on playing that many ways to play it on the first turn, and I also want my creatures to be white to take full advantage of [Paragon of New Dawns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon+of+New+Dawns). It's got soul, even if it's not a Soldier.


With all of those changes made, that brings the decklist to:

Boom! And there you have it: a fun, budget, aggressive Soldier deck for Standard.


While they probably aren't going to take down a Grand Prix any time soon, these little Soldier boys and girls make for an enjoyable deck to play at [FNM](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/friday-night-magic) and will definitely get some people to turn their heads and check out what you're doing.


If I was to de-budgetize it, I would look into both [Obelisk of Urd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Urd) as a way to pump up most of your creatures (especially if you also want to add [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm)!), and also—although very obvious—[Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos). You could also potentially go back to the more heroic route with [Fabled Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) at your side. (And [Fabled Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) in a deck with [Obelisk of Urd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+of+Urd) is a beating!)


Another route to consider is to add in black and begin to go Abzan. Anafenza is, conveniently, a Soldier, and that lets you look at some black removal and other options.


Regardless of whatever route you take, though, there's plenty of fun to be had here. Enjoy!

Soldiering On
=============


I'll admit: I didn't expect to write an article about a deck with [Preeminent Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preeminent+Captain). And yet, here we are. I love these budget weeks!


...And hopefully, you do as well. If you have any comments at all, I'd love to hear them. Feel free to [send me a tweet](http://www.twitter.com/GavinVerhey/) or a question on [my Tumblr](http://gavinverhey.tumblr.com/) and I'll be sure to see it. It's great to know if this kind of format of working on budget decks is working for you all. Let me know!


There's no challenge this week, as in two weeks I'll be back with something a little less usual. But keep on building and having fun!


And of course, I'll return next week with a take on Standard Mardu for Mardu Week! I wouldn't let the speed of the dragon slip by me like that.


Have fun playing this week, and I'll talk with you again next week!
