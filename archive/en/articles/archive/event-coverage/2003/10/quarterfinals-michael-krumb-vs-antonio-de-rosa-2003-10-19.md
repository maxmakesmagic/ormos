Derosa, in a rare act of sportsmanship, offered a pregame handshake and a meaningful “good luck” to Krumb, who accepted.

And then, “I’m good looking, you’re ugly.” Derosa said.

Krumb chose to draw, both players kept, and Derosa led off with a forest and a Liar’s Pendulum.

“In honor of Ken Krouner,” he said.

“Cathodian,” he names. “Yes,” Krumb guesses correctly.

Said Cathodian attempted to come out on the third turn, but it was met by Annul. So was Derosa’s fourth turn Icy Manipulator. But Krumb spent his fourth turn still without land number three, while Derosa was on fire. He named Frogmite with his Pendulum and a Viridian Joiner entered play.

Controversy erupted the next turn when Derosa named LEEDEN MYR with his Pendulum and Krumb said, “What card?” The card was discovered to be Leaden Myr and Krumb demanded Oracle Text. As the players had previously postulated, it was the black one. Krumb said no way, but Derosa had tricked him badly! He laughed his way into another card.

Krumb has some stuff like Neurok Spy and his own Leaden Myr, but Derosa seemed to hit every time with the Liar’s Pendulum. Upkeep, “Mountain.” “No.” And there it was.

Derosa charged in with the Frogmite from earlier and a freshly summoned Vulshok Berserker, dropping Krumb to fourteen. He tried to fight back with Nim Replica, but Derosa tricked him again with the Pendulum, drawing into a backbreaking Vulshok’s Battlegear. The Italian Stallion equipped the same-named Berserker, taking a break only to wreck Krumb’s blocking plan with a Shatter.

Krumb arrested the Berserker and hit Derosa to 16 with the Spy, but Derosa was far from out of gas. He moved the equipment to the Joiner, hit the Krumb to 2, then drew another card of the Pendulum by naming Glissa Sunkeeper.

“I didn’t think Glissa Sunkeeper was a card.”  
 “Sorry, I don’t speak English.”

Krumb made only a half-hearted attempt to get Derosa a game loss for naming a non-real card (It’s actually Glissa Sunseeker). They shuffled up for game two, with no sideboarding action on either side and Derosa bantering all the way.

Derosa, on the play again, keeps his hand, and drops Liar’s Pendulum on turn one. The players shared a quick chuckle, but Krumb’s turn two Leaden Myr is announced with a bit of anxiety. Derosa comes back with Elf Replica, and surprisingly enough, Krumb’s turn three is “Land, go,” despite his four mana available.

Italians, though, are people of action, and Derosa swings in with the Replica and a Vulshok Berserker for two straight turns, dropping Krumb to 10. Somber Hoverguard returned serve, but it was staring across at Glissa Sunseeker. Krumb’s defensive Goblin Dirigible met the most ignoble end. “Tap six, kill your artifact, Triskelion.” Krumb didn’t bother letting Derosa have the glory of an attack step. He packed, and wished the CMU-Togitter (If that’s what you call them) good luck in the semis.
