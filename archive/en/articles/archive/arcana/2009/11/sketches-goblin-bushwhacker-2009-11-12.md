M ark Tedin is a **Magic** veteran who's still at it, with a [body of work](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Mark+Tedin%22%5d) spanning from Alpha clear to *Zendikar* (and beyond?).

**Art Description**

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Let's look at the art description for [Goblin Bushwhacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker):


> Color: Red creature   
>  Location: Rocky mountainous area   
>  Action: A goblin warrior leans precariously headfirst off of a cliff face or large boulder, ready to ambush someone out-of-frame. The goblin has a sword, spear, or other long melee weapon, and has precariously anchored himself to the rock face using ropes and spikes.   
>  Focus: The goblin warrior   
>  Mood: Upper ground advantage
>

**Sketch**

Next, Mark submitted a sketch to show the creative team how he planned to interpret that description. Here's the sketch he sent:

There's the goblin, ready to ambush his quarry. And on the right, you can see where Mark worked in a little bit of storytelling: this particular goblin has been bushwhacking people from this particular spot for a while, and he's keeping a tally. The creative team gave Mark the thumbs-up to proceed.

And here's how [Goblin Bushwhacker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker) looks when it leaps out of packs of *Zendikar*.
