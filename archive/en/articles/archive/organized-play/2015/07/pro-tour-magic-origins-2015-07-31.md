When will Decklists be Published from this Pro Tour?
====================================================



In order to ensure a fair and balanced tournament, we will be withholding all decklists until the last round of Swiss. That's Round 16 on Saturday, at which point our behind-the-scenes crew will be diligently working on adding Standard Constructed decklists to written feature matches from Rounds 4–8 and Rounds 12–16, as well as any Standard feature articles that talk about a deck. If you see the following note at the top of any article:




> 
> *Decklists will be published once Round 16 begins.*
> 
> 
> 



. . . you'll know to check back later in the weekend for updated 60-card goodness.



The Top 8 decklists are published shortly after the end of Saturday, and the top Constructed decklists will be published near the end of Sunday. Remember that we're processing, troubleshooting, and staging what is likely to be over 100 decklists on Sunday, so thanks for your patience as we go through everything that we plan to publish!
