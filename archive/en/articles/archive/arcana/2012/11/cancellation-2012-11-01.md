In *Return to Ravnica*, the standard way to counter a spell is [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel).

[Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) has been in several sets since it was first introduced in *Time Spiral*:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1094_cancel_TSP.jpg)[Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=113523) | Art by [Mark Poole](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Mark%20Poole%22%5D)

When it first appeared, [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) was naturally compared to the original [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397). This wasn't just because it was the same effect for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) instead of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif). The wizard in Mark Poole's artwork was making the same arcane gesture as in the very first [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397)!

After that, it became clear that [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) was the new standard "Counter target spell" option. It appeared in *Tenth Edition* and every core set since, and also made periodic appearances in expansion sets. Here it is in *Zendikar*:

When [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) appears in an expansion, it usually takes on characteristics appropriate to the setting. The *Return to Ravnica* version is *Azorius*, for example. And the *Shards of Alara* version appears to be from the Bant shard:

There's one more piece of [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) artwork in the files, but it's not from any expansion or core set.

That's the art from the textless version of [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) that was given out by **Magic** Player Rewards in 2009. Here's what the card looked like:
