 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 





Without missing a beat, Gerard Fabiano continued his friendly banter from the previous Top 8 match.


"Want some?" he asked, waving his cologne about toward Ian Robertson.


Robertson was a regular around his local Pro Tour Qualifier circuit, and he seemed in good spirits for his for grand Prix Top 8 appearance. "No, no. I don't need a disinfectant," Robertson joked back with a smile.


If nothing else, Fabiano can always take the edge off a match and make **Magic** feel fun.


As in the quarterfinal games before [Arena Athlete](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena+Athlete) and [Elite Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher) led another quick start for Fabiano, who had removal for the first creature Robertson played on turn four. Robertson's lack of early blockers was a serious problem: Blink and you would have missed the Game 1 win from the New Jersey native.


The second game was similar to the first: Fabiano playing out his hand of creatures – [Cavalry Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus), [Elite Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher), Heliod's Emissary, and Areno Athlete – aggressively, Robertson missing crucial blockers. And again, Fabiano drove home to victory with removal when Robertson's creatures appeared too late.

"Good game," Robertson offered with a handshake before he quickly moved on. Fabiano didn't have time to chat with his opponent afterwards for this match.


**Gerard Fabiano defeated Ian Robertson, 2-0**
