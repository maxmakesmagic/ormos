Since the beginning of **Magic**, "time" has been synonymous with power, and only thirteen cards have been printed with the word "Time" in the title:

![Time Spiral](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Time+Spiral)[Time Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) (Alpha)  
[Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) (Alpha)  
 Timetwister (Alpha)  
[Time Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Elemental) (*Legends*)  
[Time Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Bomb) (*Ice Age*)  
[Sands of Time](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sands+of+Time) (*Visions*)  
[Time and Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+and+Tide)(*Visions*)  
[Time Ebb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Ebb) (*Tempest* and *Portal*)  
[Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) (*Tempest*)  
[Time Spiral](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Spiral+) (*Urza's Saga*)  
[Time Stretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stretch) (**Odyssey**)  
[Seedtime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedtime) (**Judgment**) [Timesifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=+Timesifter) (**Mirrodin**)Of these thirteen cards, three (Spiral, Walk, and Twister) are currently restricted in Type 1 (and therefore banned in Type 1.5), with another one (Vault) that was at one point banned outright in Type 1. That means that statistically, a card with "Time" in the title has a 31% chance of being banned in some format.

There are also eight cards with "Yawgmoth" in the title; two ([Yawgmoth's Bargain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Bargain) and [Yawgmoth's Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Will)) are currently restricted in Type 1. Presumably, if a card is ever printed called "Yawgmoth's Time Mox", it will go away very quickly.
