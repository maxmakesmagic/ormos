### Matthew Hunt


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Engineer


**Hometown:** Bath, United Kingdom


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Won the PTQ in Cardiff which was the final PTQ ever, I think.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Blue-Red Ulamog. It's fun, plays [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) and a ton of counterspells. Why play anything else? Also, Chandra's pretty good.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


No idea. Maybe a few cards in the sideboard need switching up.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


Ulamog not really. [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) is the best.

### Lauri Vuorela


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Supply chain coordinator


**Hometown:** Stockholm, Sweden


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


I lost the semifinals of two Game Days.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Bant Eldrazi, basically a [Cryptolith Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Rite) deck with main deck [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)s. Magnus Lantto and Oliver Tiu played it at the MOCS and I liked the way it played.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I'm not sure, maybe play something else instead of the Nissa, because she didn't really perform during the weekend.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer). As long as [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) hangs around at least.

### Oscar Christensen


**Age:** 20


**Occupation:** Substitute teacher


**Hometown:** Copenhagen, Denmark


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Gothenburg 2013 winner, Super Sunday Series finalist 2015, positive record against Christoffer Larsen.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Green-White Tokens, the best deck of the format. I haven't really played this Standard format before so the choice was obvious to me.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I would put a Plains into the sideboard so I could bring it in whenever I cut some copies of [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa).


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


All of the four-ofs.

### Jonas Friberg


**Age:** 21


**Occupation:** Chef


**Hometown:** Stockholm, Sweden


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Top 8 at Grand Prix Barcelona 2016.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Grixis Control. It fits my play style and it has room for one-ofs to tune.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I would add a [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) to the sideboard, not sure what to take out.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller).

### Julien Henry


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Reims, France


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Played Pro Tour Oath of the Gatewatch, came in tenth at Grand Prix London 2015.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Bant Company. Very high power level and has game against everything.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I would not play [Clip Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clip+Wings).


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds).

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Three Grand Prix Top 8s, Top 8 at the World Magic Cup 2015, two-time Two-Headed Giant champion with Oscar Christensen.

Green-White. Should have played Martin Müller's Mono-Blue.

Nothing performed very well.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa).

### Adam Bajerowicz

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


—


**What deck did you play and why?**


Bant Company because it is a good deck against Green-White Tokens and against control.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I would not change anything.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone). It won many games for me.

### Raphaël Lévy


**Age:** 34


**Occupation:** Publisher at Jits Magazine


**Hometown:** Toulouse, France


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Magic Pro Tour Hall of Fame. Thanks a lot to my sponsors: TCGPlayer.com, Fantasy Sphere, and Cartapapa.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Green-White with [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) in the main deck. It's the only deck I managed to win games with prior to the tournament.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Maybe cut the [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist)s, they were pretty underwhelming.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller)!
