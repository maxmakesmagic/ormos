| Everyone,
I had an interesting idea last night. What if instead of using counters, we simply remove the card from the game? Then it stays out of play until the next one is played. At that point it comes back into play.
I know this sounds crazy at first, but I’ve thought about it all last night and it solves a whole bunch of problems. Yes, there’s going to be memorization issues, but man oh man is it cleaner.
Just think about it. |
