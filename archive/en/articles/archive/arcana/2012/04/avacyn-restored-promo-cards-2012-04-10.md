The website has been taken over by *Avacyn Restored* previews! You've probably noticed. So this seems like a good time to look at some of the alternate-art promotional cards that will be available at special events!

### Prerelease

The [*Avacyn Restored* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) is April 28-29. If you remember nothing else, please remember that. But if you'd like to remember a few extra things, perhaps you'd like to know what promotional card will be available to everyone who plays in one, while supplies last.

And remember that select *Avacyn Restored* Prereleases will feature [the Helvault](/en/node/662906), where participants get to open the Helvault and share a mysterious prize. Check with your local store about preregistration!

### Launch Weekend

*Avacyn Restored* will go on sale Friday, May 4, kicking off Launch Weekend. And if you go to the May 4th [Friday Night Magic](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm), there will be a special card available, while supplies last.

### Game Day

Once *Avacyn Restored* is on sale, the big event is the [*Avacyn Restored* Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/gameday). While supplies last, everyone who participates will get an extended-art Latch Seeker:

And if you get Top 8, you'll get a Killing Wave!

### Buy-a-Box Card

And finally, there's the "Buy-a-Box card." You get it for being one of the first twenty people to buy a Booster Box of *Avacyn Restored* at a participating store. It's a foil alternate-art Silverblade Paladin!
