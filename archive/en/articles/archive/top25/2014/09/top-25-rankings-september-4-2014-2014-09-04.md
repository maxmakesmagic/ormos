Welcome to our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers were center stage last weekend, with 72 new additions to the National Teams coming to Nice in December for the ultimate nation-on-nation showdown. Those Qualifiers don't give out pro points, however, meaning that our early season leaderboard remains unchanged for this week. Things could change over the next seven days, with Grand Prix Salt Lake City next on our globetrotting schedule.



Our top six players right now are relatively stable, with Jérémy Dezani showing a 6-point lead over former Player of the Year Owen Turtenwald. Reid Duke would only need a single point more than Turtenwald in Salt Lake City to move up a place. Duke has been in excellent form, recently reaching the finals of the [StarCityGames](http://www.starcitygames.com/index.php) Invitational, where he lost to Tom Ross, who made it back to back championships. Maybe it won't be long before we see Ross step back up to the highest level of competition, with a [Pro Tour Top 8](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/pthon09/top8) already to his name.



Behind Reid Duke at No. 4 is William Jensen, but even a win in Salt Lake wouldn't see him claim the No. 3 berth from his close friend. The most recent [Pro Tour champion](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15), Ivan Floch of the Slovak Republic, sits 7 Points further back, while another European Pro Tour champion, Stanislav Cifka of the Czech Republic, is on 56 Points at No. 6.



Below those six, however, there's a frantic scrum for position. Whereas 26 points separate Jeremy Dezani from Stanislav Cifka, the next five places on the chart are covered by barely 0.2 points! The closeness continues down the field, as Rookie of the Year Jared Boettcher could vault all the way from his current No. 19 to No. 7 with a win this coming weekend.



In short, we can expect several changes seven days from now, which is precisely why you should join us once again for another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
