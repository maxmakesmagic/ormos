![Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shatter)**[Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)** – *Ice Age* common. The art for the *Ice Age* version of [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) appears to involve killing some kind of metallic mechanical man wearing a funnel for a hat. That guy looks kind of familiar.
 ![Mageta the Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mageta+the+Lion)**[Mageta the Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mageta+the+Lion)** – *Prophecy* rare. Regardless of his name, [Mageta the Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mageta+the+Lion) is not actually a lion. In fact, he's a Human Spellshaper. "The Lion" is merely a nickname or sobriquet to indicate his ferocity in battle.
 ![Reaper King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reaper+King)**[Reaper King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King)** – *Shadowmoor* rare. The [Reaper King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King) is one of the only **Magic** characters to personally respond to an [Ask Wizards question](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-january-2008-2008-01-01) (scroll down to January 8)! The only other one we can think of is [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Akroma%252C%2BAngel%2Bof%2BWrath), who answered [a whole week of questions](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-june-2006-2006-06-01) from June 12-16, 2006.
 ![Little Girl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Little+Girl)**[Little Girl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Little+Girl)** – *Unhinged* common. [Little Girl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Little+Girl) was designed to be the smallest vanilla creature possible. When it was playtested, R&D found that it was a little weak (no surprise there!), but adding an ability would have ruined the gag. So she stayed the way she was.
 ![Untaidake, the Cloud Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Untaidake%2C+the+Cloud+Keeper)**[Untaidake, the Cloud Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untaidake%2C+the+Cloud+Keeper)** – *Champions of Kamigawa* rare. Untaidake is the tallest mountain in Kamigawa, stretching impossibly far into the sky. It's so tall that it transcends mere "Mountain"-ness, so that its mana can only be used for the most powerful and legendary creatures.
 ![B-I-N-G-O](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=B-I-N-G-O)**[B-I-N-G-O](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=B-I-N-G-O)** – *Unhinged* rare. The numbers on the grid in [B-I-N-G-O](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=B-I-N-G-O) are laid out so that it takes some effort to give it +72/+72. Otherwise, they'd almost certainly be a [Magic Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square). We've got kind of a reverse-trivia today!
 ![Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lord+of+Atlantis)**[Lord of Atlantis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. Although "lord" has historically been the catchall term for a creature that gives +1/+1 to a particular type, [Lord of Atlantis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) was the only one until *Planeshift*'s [Lord of the Undead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Undead) that was actually called a "Lord" in its name.
 ![Gaea's Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gaea%27s+Liege)**[Gaea's Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Liege)** – *Time Spiral Timeshifted* rare. This slot in the *Time Spiral Timeshifted* set was a choice between [Gaea's Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Liege) and [Endless Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Wurm). Finally, the development team decided that the wurm was too similar to [Spectral Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Force) (as a giant creature) and [Auratog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog) (as something that eats enchantments), so the Liege got the call.
 ![Rings of Brighthearth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rings+of+Brighthearth)**[Rings of Brighthearth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rings+of+Brighthearth)** – *Lorwyn* rare. Many of the cards in *Lorwyn* and *Morningtide* had their parallels in *Shadowmoor* and *Eventide*. Compare the hands holding these rings, for example, to the composition of [Manamorphose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose).
 ![Joven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Joven)**[Joven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joven)** – *Homelands* uncommon. The cards from *Homelands* convey their intricate network of relationships through their flavor text. [Joven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joven)'s is said by [Chandler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandler), who has a quote by [Reveka, Wizard Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Reveka%252C%2BWizard%2BSavant), who quotes Halina, who doesn't have a card, but also appears on cards ranging from [Veldrane of Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veldrane+of+Sengir) to [Dwarven Pony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Pony).
 ![Martial Coup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Martial+Coup)**[Martial Coup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martial+Coup)** – *Conflux* rare. When the shards began to merge in *Conflux*, the inhabitants faced threats they'd never seen before. In the art for [Martial Coup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martial+Coup), several different Bant armies are banding together to fight a rampaging beast from Naya.
 ![Rolling Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rolling+Earthquake)**[Rolling Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Earthquake)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. [Rolling Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Earthquake) is nearly a functional reprint of [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake), except that it involves Horsemanship, which was the *Portal Three Kingdoms* version of Flying. As a result, [Rolling Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Earthquake) is much more powerful in an environment that includes all **Magic** cards, because Horsemanship hardly ever comes up!
 ![Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Venarian+Gold)**[Venarian Gold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold)** – *Legends* common. Years after [Venarian Gold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold) first appeared, Mark Rosewater adapted it to create *Planeshift*'s [Sleeping Potion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleeping+Potion), which was also inspired by [Skulking Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skulking+Ghost).
 ![Mercurial Kite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mercurial+Kite)**[Mercurial Kite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mercurial+Kite)** – *Scourge* common. The ability to tap creatures with combat damage was blue in *Scourge*. Just a few sets later, though, it became the green [snake mechanic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5BKashi-Tribe%5D) in *Champions of Kamigawa*.
 ![Ring of Ma'rÃ»f](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ring+of+Ma%27r%C3%BBf)**[Ring of Ma'rûf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Ma%27r%C3%BBf)** – *Arabian Nights* uncommon. The spiritual ancestor of the Wishes from *Judgment*, the [Ring of Ma'rûf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Ma%27r%C3%BBf) was, like most of the cards in *Arabian Nights*, based on a story told by [Shahrazad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shahrazad) to her husband to keep from being killed. Ma'rûf, incidentally, was a childhood friend of [Ali from Cairo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ali%2Bfrom%2BCairo).
 ![Crag Puca](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crag+Puca)**[Crag Puca](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crag+Puca)** – *Eventide* uncommon. Pucas in **Magic** are based on the mythical Celtic creatures variously spelled "pooka", "phouka", "phooka", "pwca", or almost anything else within reason. They're essentially mischievous shapeshifters, where "mischievous" can mean anything from "playful" to "homicidal" depending on the story.
 ![Wooden Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wooden+Sphere)**[Wooden Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooden+Sphere)** – *Seventh Edition* uncommon. Although it had been around since the days of *Limited Edition Alpha*, the venerable [Wooden Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooden+Sphere) never had flavor text until *Seventh Edition*. The "thousand limbs" the flavor text is talking about are tree branches.
 ![Sanctum Plowbeast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sanctum+Plowbeast)**[Sanctum Plowbeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Plowbeast)** – *Alara Reborn* common. Plowbeasts have an interesting history in the *Shards of Alara* block. In *Shards of Alara*, they're [Yoked Plowbeast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yoked%2BPlowbeast) (and mono-white), then in *Conflux* they've gone rogue and [Vagrant Plowbeast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Vagrant%2BPlowbeast) (and become green-white). Finally, they're captured be Esper mages in *Alara Reborn* and pick up some filigree to go along with their touch of blue!
 ![Cascade Bluffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cascade+Bluffs)**[Cascade Bluffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cascade+Bluffs)** – *Eventide* rare. The cycle of dual lands in *Shadowmoor* and *Eventide* was originally part of *Future Sight*'s future-shiften cards, when [Graven Cairns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graven+Cairns) provided a glimpse of things to come. The allied-color cycle (including [Graven Cairns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graven+Cairns) itself) showed up in *Shadowmoor*, while the enemy-color ones had to wait until *Eventide*.
 ![Llanowar Reborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Llanowar+Reborn)**[Llanowar Reborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Reborn)** – *Future Sight* uncommon. The rich, verdant landscape seen in the art of [Llanowar Reborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Reborn) has overgrown the destroyed, desolate Llanowar seen in the [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Forest). Bonus fact: It was made into a [Wallpaper of the Week](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-llanowar-reborn-2007-04-27)!
