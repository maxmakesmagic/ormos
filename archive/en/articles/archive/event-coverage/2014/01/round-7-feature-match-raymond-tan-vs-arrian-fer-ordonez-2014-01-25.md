Raymond is an emerging Pro who made the top 8 of two Grand Prix last year. By now, he's very comfortable at the feature match table. At stake in this game is a secure spot in Day 2.


Despite a mulligan by Arrian, Raymond was facing an equally if not more painful land flood. Swamp after Swamp came down for Raymond, all the while a second Island remained elusive.


Still, some early skirmishes played out above the board as Arrian's [Shipbreaker Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipbreaker+Kraken) met [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), then [Stymied Hopes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stymied+Hopes). Meanwhile, Raymond's [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) and [Wavecrash Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton) traded blows with [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) for life totals at 14-13 in Raymond favour. Until [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) on [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) that is.

*Arrian having [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) work out.* 

Though Raymond found [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) soon enough. Arrian had also deployed [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus) and [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary), and the following [Sea God's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+God%27s+Revenge) was lethal.


Game 2 was more of the early game standoff as Arrian's [Setessan Battle Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Battle+Priest) faced [Wavecrash Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton). Action begun as [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary) met [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) from Raymond, then Raymond's own [Thassa's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary) met [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict).


Raymond opted for the unconventional play of [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) on his own Emissary to set up for the long game. [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) on Battle Priest allowed Arrian to push some damage, but when he tried to up the stakes with [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon), it was his [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall).


This was the perfect setup for [Thassa's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary) to be bestowed on Waveclash Triton, a play three turns in the making, but which took Raymond all the way with a supporting cast of [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide)s.

*Raymond all cool with [Thassa's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary) on Triton.* 

The rubber game was more of an anti-climax as Raymond mulligan'd and stalled on two lands for multiple turns. In the post-game analysis, his peers pointed out his play of putting [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) on top of his library off a turn 1 [Temple of Mystery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Mystery) could have been the fatal error.


**Arrian wins 2-1 and is a lock for day 2.**
