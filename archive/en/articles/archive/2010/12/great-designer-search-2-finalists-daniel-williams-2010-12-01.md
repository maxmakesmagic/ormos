I made a major change to my theme this week by choosing to focus on instants and spells with flash. My old mechanics started as an attempt to convey surprise and speed, but it has become clear to me that they were no fulfilling that role adequately. I think the new theme should be more fun to play and will truly do this setting justice.


Green is represented on Deadsands by settlers, hunters, trappers, and frontiersman. Green is also represented by the Najash, a reclusive tribe of snake people that is focused on stopping the technological and industrial expansion of the frontier.


Showdown was left out of this submission because it still needs more work and I'm not sure if it belongs at common. My last attempt at the mechanic was "*Showdown-* If you cast the most spells this turn, GREATER EFFECT". This version was designed to go with the new theme.
