M**agic Online**'s upcoming expansion, *Vintage Masters*, introduces the [Power Nine](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/432) at a special rarity. So how often will you see one of the Power Nine in your booster pack?


To answer this, we need to start out by understanding the size and rarity distribution of *Vintage Masters*. Here's the breakdown by quantity at each rarity:


Special: 9  

Mythic rare: 30  

Rare: 105  

Uncommon: 80  

Common: 101


That's right, the Power Nine are so powerful and so format warping in Limited that we had to put them in their own rarity above mythic rare, a rarity we're calling Special.


Now here's the relationship between each of these:


In each booster pack you'll see:


* 10 common
* 3 uncommon
* 1 rare or mythic rare
* 1 premium foil card (any rarity, including the extremely rare premium foil Power Nine card); OR 1 Power Nine card

You will open a Power Nine card about once in 53 packs. A specific Power Nine card is about twice as rare as a specific mythic rare.


That's an oversimplification of what is a surprisingly complex system that goes way over my head. I think of it as Erik Lauer–level math, which far surpasses Trick Jarrett–level math. I'm just here to tell you about how awesome the set is and how awesome it will be to play with the Power Nine on **Magic Online**!
