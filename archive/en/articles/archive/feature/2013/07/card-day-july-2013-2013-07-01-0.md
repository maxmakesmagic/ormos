Card of the Day - July, 2013

By Mike McArtor




 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 









![1737](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1737)  
**[Marsh Gas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Gas)** – *The Dark* common. After the cataclysmic ending of the Brothers' War—between Urza (who became a Planeswalker) and Mishra (who worked with the Phyrexians!)—Dominaria was cast into darkness. Huge dust clouds blotted out the sun, which eventually would lead to, well, an *Ice Age*. But before then, the plane found itself in *The Dark*. The story of *The Dark* was tied into that of *Ice Age* a few years later with Jeff Grubb's popular novel [*The Gathering Dark*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gathering_Dark). 
 


![Phyrexian Tribute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Tribute)  
**[Phyrexian Tribute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Tribute)** – *Mirage* rare. Even if you're new to **Magic**, you've probably heard of *New Phyrexia*, but that name implies there was an Old Phyrexia, right? Right! (It was called Rath.) [The Coalition's war against Phyrexians](https://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/phyrexiavsthecoalition/productinfo) was the central conflict to **Magic**'s first major plotline, which followed the crew of the airship *Weatherlight* across several of the game's earliest blocks. (Spoilers: The Coalition won!... ish.) 
 


![Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Door+of+Destinies)  
**[Door of Destinies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies)** – ***Magic 2014*** Core Set rare. According to [Comprehensive Rule](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules) 205.3m (July, 2013, edition), there are 224 creature types for you to choose from when you play [Door of Destinies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies), from [Advisor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Advisor%22%5D) to [Zubera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Zubera%22%5D). That is obviously more than we can list here, so go check out [this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/mistform-ultimus-watch-magic-2013-edition-2012-08-15) from last year, whose list is still up to date! 
 


![Slaughter Games](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Slaughter+Games)  
**[Slaughter Games](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Games)** –  *Return to Ravnica* rare. You can't spell "slaughter" without "laughter!" According to the *Return to Ravnica* world guide, "The Rakdos guild may be a demon-worshipping death cult, but it throws the best parties on Ravnica." It also notes that every human member "is a sadist with the soul of an entertainer. Or vice versa." Their fêtes, it turns out, are simply to *die* for. 
 


![Tribute to Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tribute+to+Hunger)  
**[Tribute to Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribute+to+Hunger)** – *Innistrad* common. Alas, poor Marella! The *Innistrad* world guide has quite a bit to say about the plane's vampires, but our space here is limited. They are not truly undead, for example, although they have some undead traits (such as agelessness and skin cold to the touch). Vampirism is neither a virus nor a curse, but what the vampires themselves somewhat euphemistically call a "condition of the blood." 
 


![Stun Sniper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stun+Sniper)  
**[Stun Sniper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stun+Sniper)** – *Alara Reborn* uncommon. There are [twenty-four Human Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Human%22%5D+%5B%22Archer%22%5D) in **Magic** spread across all five colors. The most common ability shared by Archers is to [tap to deal damage to a creature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Human%22%5D+%5B%22Archer%22%5D&text=+%5Bcreature%5D+%5Bdeal%5D+%5Bdamage%5D). Tapping a creature damaged in this way is a red ability going all the way back to [Falling Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falling+Star), from *Legends*. 
 


![Thirst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thirst)  
**[Thirst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst)** – *Mirage* common. The third part of Mark Rosewater's discussion of *Mirage*'s design [on his Drive to Work podcast](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/garfield-play-2013-07-22) went up Friday. Coincidence? Well, yes. But it works out nicely! And if you'd like to learn even more about the creation of *Mirage*, R&D's Bill Rose [wrote an article about it](/en/articles/archive/three-year-mirage-2003-04-18)... way back in 2003! 
 


![Hunt the Weak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hunt+the+Weak)  
**[Hunt the Weak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunt+the+Weak)** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* common. Hey you, [let's fight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701082/quotes?item=qt0140144)! [Fight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5Bfight%5D+%5B%28each%5D+%5Bdeals%5D) is a [relatively recent addition](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/161d&page=3) to the list of keyword actions, but the ability goes allllll the way back to 1994, with the card [Arena](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=97042), first available with [the novel of the same name](/en/articles/archive/arena-2013-06-18). 
 


![Manaweft Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Manaweft+Sliver)  
**[Manaweft Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaweft+Sliver)** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* uncommon. You probably know what "mana" means in the context of **Magic**. But is "weft" an invention of the creative team? Nope! It's [a weaving term](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weft) for the yarn or thread carried by the shuttle across the warp. Hmm... lots of jargon there. In other words, it's the yarn or thread that makes up half a weave in cloth. So our little Sliver buddy here (and its Sliver kin) weaves mana together for your benefit! 
 


![Regathan Firecat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Regathan+Firecat)  
**[Regathan Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regathan+Firecat)** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set*  common. The "–n" ending of "Regathan" implies it is a possessive adjective, so what then is Regatha? Well, it's a plane of the Multiverse, first seen on a card with *Planechase* (2012 Edition)'s [Mount Keralia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=226515). You can learn all about the plane by reading *[Fuel for the Fire, Part II](/en/node/626671)* and *[The Purifying Fire](/en/articles/archive/purifying-fire-2010-04-18)*. Oh, and yes, in case you were wondering, there **is** a tie between Chandra (face of M14) and Regatha. But you'll have to read to find out what! 
 


![Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blood+Bairn)  
**[Blood Bairn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn)** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set*  common. A "bairn," as the art and flavor text suggest, is a child. Today, this word is chiefly Scottish, and has been considered as such since the early part of the 18th century, but it traces back to Old English (and Old Norse) and has been in use since at least the 12th century.
 


![Armored Cancrix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Armored+Cancrix)  
**[Armored Cancrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Cancrix)** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set*  common. So, "Cancrix" is fun because it's not an actual English word but you can see where it came from: the Cancrix is a Crab, which ties in with the constellation [Cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_%28constellation%29), whose name traces back to the Latin "cancer" ([crab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_%28genus%29)), borrowed from the Greek "karkinos" (crab, tumor, constellation), *which in turn* traces back to the [Proto-Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) root "qarq–" (hard). Whew! And "-rix?" In **Magic**, it's a combining form [previously seen on Beasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5Brix%5D+!%5BMatrix%5D+!%5BGrixis%5D&subtype=+%5B%22Beast%22%5D). 
 


![Seraph of the Sword](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seraph+of+the+Sword)  
**[Seraph of the Sword](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seraph+of+the+Sword)** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set*  rare. The English word "seraph" is an assumed singular version of the Hebrew plural word "seraphim," which came to English from Latin (via Greek). You probably know (or can guess from the creature type) the seraphim are a choir (or kind) of angel. Our singular word seraph's first known appearance is in Milton's [*Paradise Lost*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost), from 1667 ([Book 5](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_5/), in case you're curious). 
 
![Witchstalker](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/gddkdnxVyS_EN.jpg)  
**Witchstalker** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* rare. Which Witch does the Witchstalker stalk? Well, prior to **Magic** 2014's release, there are [twelve blue and/or black Witches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5BWitch%5D+!%5BHunter%5D+!%5BNephilim%5D+!%5BEngine%5D&type=+%5B%22Creature%22%5D&color=+%40%28%7C%5BU%5D%7C%5BB%5D%29) in **Magic**. It seems most likely, though, that this fearsome Wolf is stalking fellow M14 card, Bogbrew Witch.

![Mindsparker](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/eHKYT4nmVe_EN.jpg)  
**Mindsparker** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* rare. If you want to play this guy, you'll be interested to know there are [twenty-four](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&color=%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BU%5D&set=+%5B%22Magic+2014+Core+Set%22%5D&type=%7C%5B%22Instant%22%5D%7C%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D) white or blue instants or sorceries in ***Magic** 2014*. In pre-M14 Standard, there are [156](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=%7C%5B%22Instant%22%5D%7C%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D&color=+%40%28%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BU%5D%29&format=+%5B%22Standard%22%5D). And pre-M14 Modern? [646](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=%7C%5B%22Instant%22%5D%7C%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D&color=+%40%28%7C%5BW%5D%7C%5BU%5D%29&format=+%5B%22Modern%22%5D).

![Lifebane Zombie](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/03VQSghGg1_EN.jpg)  
**Lifebane Zombie** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* rare. White hate and green hate are nothing new in black, of course, but the first, last, and only time we saw an ability similar to this was [Talara's Bane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talara%27s+Bane), from *Eventide*.

![Tidebinder Mage](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/S85q1UfZFG_EN.jpg)  
**Tidebinder Mage** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* rare. Prior to Tidebinder Mage, there were [twelve permanents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5Bdoesn%27t%5D+%5Buntap%5D+%5Bfor%5D+%5Bas%5D+%5Blong%5D+%5Byou%5D+%5Bcontrol%5D+%5Btap%5D+%5Btarget%5D) that tapped another permanent and kept it pinned down. Eleven of those had to stay tapped themselves, but [Dungeon Geists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungeon+Geists) was a little different!

![Fiendslayer Paladin](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/dsCIKj3nlB_EN.jpg)  
**Fiendslayer Paladin** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* rare. This Paladin has a lot of work ahead of him. There are [twenty-two black or red Fiends](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Bfiend%5D&type=+%5B%22Creature%22%5D&color=+%40%28%7C%5BB%5D%7C%5BR%5D%29) in **Magic**.

![Kalonian Hydra](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/8Z371vdE7f_EN.jpg)  
**Kalonian Hydra** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* mythic rare. Kalonian Hydra also appears in [***Magic** 2014*—*Duels of the Planeswalkers*](/en/articles/archive/magic-2014%E2%80%94duels-planeswalkers-2013-06-26).

**Rise of the Dark Realms** – ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* mythic rare. This is not the first time we've seen the Dark Realms on a card name, as [a version of Liliana](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=a+version+of+Liliana) is of there.

![Windreader Sphinx ](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/nNB7GIMw2q_EN.jpg)
