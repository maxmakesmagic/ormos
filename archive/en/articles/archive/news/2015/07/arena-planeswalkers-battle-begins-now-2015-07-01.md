For months we've been teasing out bits of information about  [*Arena of the Planeswalkers*](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/products/arena-planeswalkers), the *Magic: The Gathering* strategy board game featuring the likes of Gideon, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, and Nissa. After [announcing the game](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/boardgame) in October of last year, [we showed off a few bits from the game](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/arena-planeswalkers-2015-02-25) in February, including some of Chandra's game pieces.


And now, the game has arrived.

That's right, *Arena of the Planeswalkers* is now available from select retailers, with expanded product availability increasing throughout the month.


Pick up your copy today and ensure you're the last Planeswalker standing!
