There are 22 Kithkin creatures and spells in *Lorwyn* (plus the changelings). But as the plane is full of those fiercely community-oriented humanoids, kithkin show up on many more cards than that. Look for their squat, pumpkinlike faces on these and other *Lorwyn* cards.


Sometimes kithkin are shown taking the brunt of spells or effects. Here’s a pair of kithkin experiencing the wrong end of a point of [Tremor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tremor)-like damage.

Here’s a kithkin about to make the unpleasant acquaintance of a marauding boggart with a hedgehog-loaded slingshot.

Take a look at the full art of [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) to see the three little kithkin grooming the giant’s cloudgoat. The giant is grooming her nails with a kithkin longsword.

Here are just a few more of the *Lorwyn* cards that feature kithkin cameos—some subtle, some pretty obvious. Can you find more?
