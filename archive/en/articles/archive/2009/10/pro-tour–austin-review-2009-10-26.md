The 2009 **Magic** Pro Tour showcased big names and big plays at [Pro Tour–Austin](/en/events/coverage/kibler-completes-comeback-austin-victory), and now it's time to see how the dust has settled. Austin showcased the best players in Extended and *Zendikar* Booster Draft. What decks emerged from the new Extended as the top dogs? Is combo the way to go, or is aggro a better choice? Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major deck archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.
