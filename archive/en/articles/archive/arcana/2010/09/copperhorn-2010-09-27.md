Do you remember [Copperhoof Vorrac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperhoof+Vorrac)? It was one of the three [Vorrac-related cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?name=+%5B%22vorrac%22%5D) in *Mirrodin*.

Well, in the years since *Mirrodin*, the distinctive copper-colored tusks have been taken up by the elves known as the [Copperhorn Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperhorn+Scout)s.
