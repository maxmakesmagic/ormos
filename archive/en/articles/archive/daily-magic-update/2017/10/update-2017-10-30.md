The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 30, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by my sister and her wonderful new husband. Congratulations, you two!


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. A Trio of Grand Prix

There were three—yes *tres*—Grand Prix this past weekend. That's a lot of Grand Prix action. Probably enough that you missed some stuff. If so, here are some helpful links, because I'm so helpful. And so linkful? Sure, let's go with that.


* Grand Prix Phoenix video [replay 1](https://go.twitch.tv/videos/185813297) and [replay 2](https://go.twitch.tv/videos/186071342)—Only Phoenix got the video treatment, and only Phoenix featured a deep run by Reid Duke. You know what to do.
* [Grand Prix Phoenix Highlights](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppho17/grand-prix-phoenix-highlights-2017-10-29) | Marc Calderaro—For anyone looking for a faster recap than 21 hours of video.
* [Top Stories of Grand Prix Liverpool 2017](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpliv17/top-stories-of-gp-liverpool-2017-10-29) | Tobi Henke
* [Top Stories Grand Prix Hong Kong 2017](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gphk17/top-stories-grand-prix-hong-kong-2017-2017-10-29) | Chapman Sim
1. [StarCityGames.com Washington, DC Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/281017_washingtondc.html)

Legacy ruled the roost for the weekend in our nation's capital, and Jon Goss and his Four-Color Deathblade variant ruled Legacy. Check out the replay of the weekend on [SCG's Twitch archive page](https://go.twitch.tv/scgtour/videos/all).


1. [Are Women Less Competitive than Men? – Women in *Magic: The Gathering* Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_Y-sxFrlOM) | Elantris | Athena Froehlich

A long conversation continued throughout the weekend about women in competitive gaming (spurred on, initially, by [Daniel Fournier's article "Men and *Magic*: Building Community"](http://manadeprived.com/men-magic-building-community/) from last week). Here, Athena gives her take on the conversation, on women in gaming (specifically *Magic*), and more.


For more on this, check out [Rich Stein's article below](#5).

Today's Must
============


1. [The New Player's Guide to *Magic: The Gathering* Open House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_MltCxTvu4&feature=youtu.be) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

Come for the helpful information about *Magic* Open House, stay for the *Rivals of Ixalan* promo preview. Then also stay because the video is a strong resource for letting players know what Open House is.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_MltCxTvu4>


Also, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
=====================================


1. [An Article About Articles About Women in *Magic*](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/10/an-article-about-articles-about-women-in-magic/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Rich Stein

This is a pretty good summary about the conversation about women in *Magic* that we referenced above. Also, solid title.


1. [Understanding the Modern Banned List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/understanding-the-modern-banned-list?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

There's been a lot of talk about the Modern banned list lately, so SaffronOlive jumps in with an article talking about the *why* of the current ban list rather than whether cards should be banned. Though there's a bit of that as well. It's pretty hard to avoid that part of it.


1. [Mining Modern – Halloween Special](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxg8UAfS2YJZgms9DNotLHzrtJBzG62Tb) | TCGplayer | Corbin Hosler

I'm a simple man—you put Halloween in your title, I'm going to give you a second look. And a third. Probably a fourth as well. In this case, Hosler brought Vampires (the most Halloween-ish of *Ixalan* tribes) to Modern. Stay tuned, because Hosler actually manages to steal a creature with [Captivating Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captivating+Vampire). In Modern. Where all the removal lives.

Adorable children? Check. Nostalgia? Check. Familial bonding? Check. I think we have a winner here. As *Magic* hits 25 years old, this, I think, will become more and more common.

Uh, spoiler alert if you didn't watch Prof's video, I guess? Anyway, everyone loves a Magali Villeneuve piece, so this art is already the talk of the town.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Black-Red Aggro](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-ptq-2017-10-29)

The latest *Magic Online* hotness is an evolution of the Mono-Black Aggro deck we looked at last week to incorporate red removal and burn, plus Hazoret the Fervent (because Hazoret), into a tight, aggressive, Rakdos-y package.


TFTIJHUB played this to a 4th-place finish in the *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier this past weekend, but similar lists saw play in the same tournament and are popping up in Competitive Standard League lists.


The deck has an energy sub-theme with [Aethersphere Harvester](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersphere+Harvester) and [Glint-Sleeve Siphoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Sleeve+Siphoner), but is more or less all about just staying low to the ground. [Night Market Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Market+Lookout) is, for example, a one-drop that hits for "2" and can keep draining opponents even after it stopped being able to attack thanks to [Aethersphere Harvester](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersphere+Harvester).


[Yahenni, Undying Partisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yahenni%2C+Undying+Partisan) even makes an appearance here, in part because there's so much delicious food surrounding them. [Scrapheap Scrounger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger) and [Dread Wanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer) both come back, and [Bomat Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier) can often be a dead draw in the late game.


Expect this deck to keep developing as players realize the raw, unchecked power that is [Night Market Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Market+Lookout).
