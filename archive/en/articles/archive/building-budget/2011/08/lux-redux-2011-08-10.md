Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






I wrote about a [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) deck [a few months](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/good-lux-2011-02-16) back. Since then, many readers have sent me emails asking if I could update the list with *New Phyrexia* and ***Magic** 2012*. [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) is a powerful spell that has the ability to completely take over any game in which it is left untouched. It's a difficult card to build around, but putting in a bit of work can often be very rewarding.

![Lux Cannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lux+Cannon)  
In the past, my [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) decks have done very well against control decks whenever [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) successfully resolves. Unfortunately, [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) doesn't always resolve. Savvy control players will save countermagic for your [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), and you may be in a fairly awkward spot. I wanted to make sure that I had a threat that I didn't care was countered. I needed a fast clock that was powerful against everyone. I needed [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix).

![Kuldotha Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kuldotha+Phoenix)  
Sure, the mana cost on [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix) is a little prohibitive, but why can't I just be a mono-red deck? Previously, I played blue for cards like [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) and [Treasure Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage). *New Phyrexia* introduced [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit) and [Volt Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge) to the mix. With these two powerful cards I won't need to rely on [Treasure Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) to find [Contagion Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine) to lock up the late game. [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix) provides a fast clock, inevitability, and a 4-toughness flying body to ruin the day of Caw-Blade players who have hopeful dreams of hitting you with a [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine).

| Tezzeret's Gambit | Volt Charge |

[Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit) is a really impressive card. I've never been ashamed to have a few [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination)s in a deck, and this card essentially lets you play with [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) regardless of what colors you're playing. Drawing two cards is a powerful effect, but the effect becomes significantly more powerful when you take proliferate into consideration. Our deck is sure to be playing many cards that benefit from proliferate. Cards like [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet), [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), and [Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns) will all gain a big advantage when you're casting [Volt Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge)s and [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit)s.

[Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) is still [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). I'll happily play four copies of this spell as spot removal. Three damage is enough to kill a Bird carrying [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) and one mana is a fine cost to deal with a Bird that's about to pick up a [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace).



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Lightning Bolt | Tumble Magnet |

[Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) is another card that works very well against Swords. [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) is also an excellent answer to an on-board Titan. With [Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp)s and both proliferate spells you shouldn't have any trouble keeping enough counters on your [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) to tap down any significant threat.

[Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) is the best anti-control card available to a deck like this. As a mono-red deck we don't have access to cards like [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) that would normally allow us to fight counter wars. [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) will provide our deck with large amounts of mana that we can use to pay for our opponent's [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s and [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce)s. If the game goes long you may find yourself with a lot of counters on multiple [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice)s. Drawing a [Red Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith) can often be worth the full 20 points of damage needed to dispatch your opponent.



|  |  |

| Everflowing Chalice | Sphere of the Suns |

[Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns), while not as powerful as [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), still ramps us into powerful turn-three plays like [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) or turn-four [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix). The colored mana produced by [Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns) will help us cast our [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix) and give us the option of paying mana instead of life for the Phyrexian mana on our [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit) and [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember). If you're lucky enough to own a few copies of [Koth of the Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer), then you definitely want to include them in this mono-red deck that plays eight two-mana accelerants.

At least a few copies of [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) are necessary to deal with the broad brush of problems presented by the new Standard format. [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) are problematic for this deck, and we need a main-deck answer. Post-board we can go to four copies of this spell. Thanks to our [Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns) we can even pay some black mana to lose a little less life from the Phyrexian cost.



|  |  |

| Dismember | Red Sun's Zenith |

[Red Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith) seems like a powerful endgame for this deck. The [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice)s will get very dangerous in the late game, and it seems reasonable for us to blast people for double digits with our [Red Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith)s.

Here's the main deck once we crunch some numbers:

[Slagstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm) is a perfect sideboard card for a deck like this. In fact, playing a few [Slagstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm)s in the main deck may be the right choice if your local metagame has a good amount of [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), Goblins, Vampires, or [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) decks.

I want a few extra copies of [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) against [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo. These can also come in over two [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s against decks like Caw-Blade or anything with [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace).



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Slagstorm | Oxidda Scrapmelter |

[Act of Aggression](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Aggression) is another spells that works very well against [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo. I may already have the [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)s, but it isn't enough to make the matchup feel reasonable. I have the space in my sideboard, and I'll be happy to play the extra help.

I'll finish up my sideboard with artifact removal. I want to make sure that I can deal with opposing swords. [Oxidda Scrapmelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Scrapmelter) is better than [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) because our deck has so many two-mana accelerators.

I put the deck together on **Magic Online** and played a few matches to see how it fared against what people are playing in the Constructed queues.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab155_match1header.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab155_grave.jpg)I lost the roll and kept 2 [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit), [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix), [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), and [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet). My opponent played a [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and passed the turn. I drew a [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), played a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), played another [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), and passed the turn. I drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), played it, cast [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), and passed the turn. My opponent played an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed the turn back. I drew another [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit), played my [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), and attempted to cast [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), but my opponent had the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). My opponent played a [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores), cast [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), drew a card, and passed the turn. I used [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to kill Jace, then drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), played it, and cast [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix). I attacked, but my opponent had a [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and paid 4 life to deal with the Phoenix. My opponent played a fifth land and passed the turn.

I drew a [Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns), cast it, cast [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet), and passed the turn. My opponent tapped out for a [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and passed the turn back.

My opponent entered combat, and I tapped down the [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). My opponent still attacked me for 4 damage with Zombies, cast [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), and made me discard a card. I discarded [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix), and my opponent played a land and passed the turn. I reanimated my other [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix), drew a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and attacked for 8 damage.

I reanimated the Phoenix again, drew a [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), played it, and attacked for what would have been lethal. This time a [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) was fully paid for, and my opponent dropped to 4. I cast a [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit) using my [Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns), drew [Volt Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge) and a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and passed the turn.

My opponent cast [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) and passed the turn. I tapped the Sphinx during the end step and reanimated the [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix) on my turn, and my opponent conceded.

The deck worked very well in the practice matches I played. The sideboard may need some work, but the main deck seems like it's where I want it to be. If you can get your hands on [Koth of the Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer) or [Chandra, the Firebrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+the+Firebrand) then I would suggest adding those to the main deck over [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon)s and some other sampling of spells. I would still play the [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon)s in the sideboard to help the control match-ups.

Remember that [Act of Aggression](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Aggression) is very strong against [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx), as you can cast it during your draw step after your opponent's triggers for the Sphinx go on the stack. If your opponent draws two cards, then you can draw four, and your deck has enough cheap burn that filling up your hand with pure gas will almost assure victory against most decks that play [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx). This interaction seems very important in post-sideboard games with this deck.
