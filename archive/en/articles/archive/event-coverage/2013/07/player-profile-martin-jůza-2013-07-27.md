Martin Jůza is one of the most successful, most consistent players to come out of Europe since Hall of Famer Raphael Levy. Over the course of his career, he has made more Grand Prix Top 8s than most players have in Grand Prixs attended. He has won four of them, and he's done so across every continent that holds Grand Prix.


The epitome of a world traveler, Jůza has really embraced the ability the game has afforded him to travel and see the world. Along the way, he has made many friends and joined the powerhouse ChannelFireball, aiding him in his continuing search for perfection. For the past few years, Jůza has been among, if not the best player on the entire European continent.


Jůza's lone blemish on his record is the fact that he's only made two Pro Tour Top 8s, and he didn't make it out of the quarterfinals of either. Winning an event like this, against fifteen of the best players in the world, many of whom are his friends, would go a long way towards silencing his critics. Still, he has his work cut out for him. Fortunately, the Czech player is playing on as close to home turf as anyone in the tournament, with Amsterdam coming in at around 500 miles from Prague.
