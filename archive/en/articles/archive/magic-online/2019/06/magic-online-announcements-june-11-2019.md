*Modern Horizons*: *Magic Online* Edition
-----------------------------------------


*Modern Horizons* events are well underway (and boosters go on sale June 14), but events are only available until August 14, so log in and play today! You'll be able to play in Draft Leagues, Sealed Leagues, and Phantom Draft Leagues, and we're introducing a new entry option specifically for this set: *Modern Horizons* Tokens.


Check out [Chris's release article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/state-magic-online-modern-horizons-play-lobby-2019-05-23) for additional info on entry options, *Modern Horizons* tokens, and more.

Format Point Reminder
---------------------


The scramble for Format Points is on as the next round of Format Playoffs approach for the 2019 MOCS. If you're in the four Format Focus lanes, you can continue accruing Format Points in Challenges and Leagues. Get 35 in a single format by its Playoff date, and you can join—Modern (June 22), Legacy (June 23), Vintage (June 29), and Pauper (June 30).




---

Team Modern Super League
------------------------


The newest Super League season is here with the return of the Team Modern format! Eight teams (including Wizards' Play Design group) will battle over 13 weeks for bragging rights in Modern. This week, expect to see *Modern Horizons* in play for the first time. The broadcast begins at 6 p.m. PT every Tuesday at [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).

MOCS Make-Up Event
------------------


The MOCS Preliminary event from Sunday has been rescheduled to Sunday, July 7, at 7:00 a.m. Pacific time (14:00 UTC). It will feature *Modern Horizons* Phantom Sealed and qualifies for the July 13 MOCS Playoff. The event will be open to all players who pay the entry option of 35 MOCS Qualifier Points.


Players that were registered for Sunday's event have received 3 *Modern Horizons* boosters and a refund of their entry.




---

Limited MOCS Open Saturday
--------------------------


A MOCS Open will take place on Saturday, June 15, beginning at 7 a.m. PT. The format is *Modern Horizons* Sealed Deck, and this is the only *Modern Horizons* MOCS Open, meaning this will be the only major MH1 event to be run non-phantom and the contents of the packs opened will be added to participants' collections. This makes it a great opportunity to collect these cards while earning Leaderboard Points, qualifying for the Mythic Championship, or even winning a coveted seat at the Championships themselves.


Entry options for the MH1 MOCS Open are 500 Play Points, 50 Event Tickets, or 25 *Modern Horizons* Tokens, and the winner will qualify for the 2019 *Magic Online* Championship as well as Mythic Championship Barcelona.

Limited MCQ Finals Sunday
-------------------------


On Sunday, June 16, there will be a Limited MCQ Finals at 7 a.m. PT. The set will be *War of the Spark*, and the event will cost 1 Limited MCQ Finals Token. The winner will receive an invitation to Mythic Championship Richmond.

Build Notes
-----------


General | Entering a match by directly challenging another player results in a best-of-three match with 40 minutes on each player's timer (up from 25).


Duel Scene | Triggered abilities that check the power of creatures, such as [Dreadhorde Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadhorde+Butcher), will now be clearer and identify the amount of damage dealt by the trigger.


Duel Scene | Players who control multiple copies of a permanent with a triggered ability will find it easier to identify the source of each.


Cube| A bug that sometimes prevented players from casting "two-brid" spells (such as Spectral Procession) using mana not of the card's color has been resolved.


Standard | [Ral, Storm Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ral%2C+Storm+Conduit) is no longer interested in triggering his ability when the opponent makes a copy of his controller's spells.


Play Lobby | Numerous small iterations and improvements have been made. Players should expect this iteration to continue in future releases.


Standard, Draft | [Bond of Passion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bond+of+Passion) has developed a passion for clarity and will now be clearer about what it intends to do to each target.


Modern | [Flamerush Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamerush+Rider)'s created token once again enters the battlefield attacking.


Modern | [Body Double](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Body+Double) has remembered to copy dead creature cards, not immediately join them upon entering the battlefield.


Modern | [Vesuvan Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Shapeshifter) has figured out the difference between its innate morph and any copied megamorph abilities, and no longer inappropriately gains +1/+1 counters.
