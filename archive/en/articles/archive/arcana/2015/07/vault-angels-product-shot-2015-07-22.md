*From the Vault: Angels* releases next month (August 21!), but we're not quite ready to show off the whole set. Don't worry—we'll get there, angel aficionados. I promise it's worth the wait.


But we're going to tease it out just a little bit today and show off the packaging as well as—dramatic pause—the three cards on the face of said packaging.


Enjoy!
