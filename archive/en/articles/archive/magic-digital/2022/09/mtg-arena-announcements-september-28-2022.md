Win $2,500 This Weekend in the Arena Open!
==========================================


[![Arena Open October 1–2 with entry reward Phyrexian card style of Sheoldred, the Apocalypse](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/850_arena_open_oct1-2.jpg)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/october-2022-arena-open-dominaria-united-limited-2022-09-21)


This weekend, October 1–2, the Arena Open returns with two days of play and prizes—up to $2,500—and it's all about *Dominaria United* in Limited formats! Everyone who enters also receives the Phyrexian-language card style of Sheoldred, the Apocalypse.


As a bonus, everyone who enters Day 1 can enter—with no fee!—[the Mixed-Up Phantom Sealed event](#mixedupsealed) that runs through this weekend, too!


Day 1 offers your choice of Sealed competitions, Best-of-One and traditional Best-of-Three. Here, everyone is on a level playing field, and you can prove you have the skills of a champion. Perform well, and you'll secure your invitation to the Day 2 event, where the prizes really escalate!


Day 2 features drafting, and there will be two events—one right after the other—to keep things interesting. Score three wins in Draft One, and you're invited to Draft Two. This is where the stakes hit their peak, and so do the size of the prizes—as much as $2,500. Plus, earn just one win, and you'll also pocket an invitation to the October Qualifier Weekend!


Get all the [details on the *Dominaria United* Arena Open](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/october-2022-arena-open-dominaria-united-limited-2022-09-21)!


Mixed-Up Phantom Sealed Event October 1–3
=========================================


Finished your run in this weekend's Arena Open? Kick back with some mixed-up Phantom Sealed fun, beginning October 1 at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC) and running until October 3 at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC). If you entered Day 1 of Arena Open, skip the entry fee and start playing! If you didn’t enter the Arena Open, no problem! You can enter for 5,000 gold or 750 gems.


You'll receive six packs of mystery cards from across *MTG Arena*. Build a 40-card deck and play as many times as you like for the rest of the weekend; you can resign and re-enter for new packs to build and play a new deck!


This is a Phantom event, so these cards aren’t added to your collection.
