Spawnsire of Ulamog
-------------------

[Spawnsire of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnsire+of+Ulamog)'s last ability wriggled through the *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* Oracle update to templates describing the casting of spells. On the off chance we make a modal-double faced card with an Eldrazi on the back face, it'll be clearer that you can cast it with Spawnsire!


**Previous wording:**


Annihilator 1 *(Whenever this creature attacks, defending player sacrifices a permanent.)*  

{4}: Create two 0/1 colorless Eldrazi Spawn creature tokens. They have "Sacrifice this creature: Add {C}."  

{20}: Cast any number of Eldrazi cards from among cards you own outside the game without paying their mana costs.


**New wording:**


Annihilator 1 *(Whenever this creature attacks, defending player sacrifices a permanent.)*  

{4}: Create two 0/1 colorless Eldrazi Spawn creature tokens. They have "Sacrifice this creature: Add {C}."  

{20}: Cast any number of Eldrazi spells from among cards you own outside the game without paying their mana costs.


Wildfire Cerberus
-----------------

The tail of this doggie, that is, the last few words, deviated from some precedents. Even though there's no functional difference, we're bringing it in line. Good dog.


**Previous wording:**


{5}{R}{R}: Monstrosity 1. *(If this creature isn't monstrous, put a +1/+1 counter on it and it becomes monstrous.)*  

When Wildfire Cerberus becomes monstrous, it deals 2 damage to each opponent and each creature your opponents control.


**New wording:**


{5}{R}{R}: Monstrosity 1. *(If this creature isn't monstrous, put a +1/+1 counter on it and it becomes monstrous.)*  

When Wildfire Cerberus becomes monstrous, it deals 2 damage to each opponent and each creature they control.


"Wish we had a shorter template here . . ."
-------------------------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Burning+Wish)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish)
We tightened up the template used for bringing cards from outside the game into the game. The previous template had an additional verb ("choose") that didn't seem necessary. Here's an example of this change that affected 14 cards.


**Previous wording:**


You may choose a sorcery card you own from outside the game, reveal that card, and put it into your hand. Exile Burning Wish.


**New wording:**


You may reveal a sorcery card you own from outside the game and put it into your hand. Exile Burning Wish.
