At the Prerelease this past weekend, or looking over the Card Image Gallery, perhaps you found yourself staring at a [particularly disturbing piece of art](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Unlife) and wondering what's going on in it, or reading [some bit of flavor text](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrosive+Gale) that suggests there's more to the story. Maybe you're wondering how [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) fits into the story, or why [Urabrask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urabrask+the+Hidden) is called "the Hidden."

Over the last five weeks, the Planeswalker's Guide to New Phyrexia has run in Savor the Flavor, showcasing the world of New Phyrexia with card art, concept illustrations, and text from the *New Phyrexia* style guide. It's both a field guide to the set and an inside glimpse at the resources the creative team used as they built the setting of New Phyrexia in all its horrifying, biomechanical, panchromatic glory. We present it here in its entirety, with improved navigation between the various sections.

Even if—*especially* if—you're not a regular reader of Savor the Flavor, it's well worth a look.

*"The last of the Not-Whole shall be discovered, though our eyeholes wince at their hideousness. Their bodies shall be absorbed and their imperfection shall be purged. The Machine Orthodoxy shall engorge the Not-Whole and their deficient isolation shall be obliterated in the Unity. Only then shall the last wounds in the Circle be healed. Only then shall this world compleat itself."*  
*—Izathel, High Chancellor*
