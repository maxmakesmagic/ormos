**row·en![Rowen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rowen)**  

From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: noun  

1 : a second-growth crop  
Etymology: Middle English *rowein*, from (assumed) Old North French *rewain*; akin to Old French *regaïn* aftermath, from *re- + gaïn* aftermath, of Germanic origin; akin to Old High German *weida* pasture, *weidanOn* to hunt for food  

Date: 15th century

**pa·ta·gi·um![Patagia Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Patagia+Golem)**  

From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: noun

1 : the fold of skin connecting the forelimbs and hind limbs of some tetrapods (as flying squirrels)  

2 : the fold of skin in front of the main segments of a bird's wing  

Etymology: New Latin, from Latin, gold edging on a tunic  

Date: 1826

**Can·ti·vore![Cantivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cantivore)**  

From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
Function: noun  

Etymology: Like the atogs, the *Odyssey* lhurgoyfs were named with their abilities in mind. For example, Cantivore was derived from the word *incantation*, which has a very strong magical feel to it. Thus, a Cantivore derives power from magical energy, which is one way to describe what enchantments would be in the "real" world. Along the same lines, [Magnivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnivore) takes its root from *magnify*, which describes what happens to emotions in red, and so on.
