The Bigger They Come . . .

 Chas Andres is a freelance writer and MFA student living in Wilmington, North Carolina. When he's not at his keyboard dreaming up stories, you can find him playing with his cats, listening to records, or building yet another Magic deck. 





When I was a kid, I had the original *Star Wars* trilogy on VHS. This was before the prequels were out, and I had yet to discover the extended universe novels hiding in the adult sci-fi section at my local library. All I had of *Star Wars* were three VHS tapes and their worn cardboard covers. I played them over and over again until my favorite scenes were overrun by static and fuzz.


The scene I watched more than any other happens toward the beginning of *The Empire Strikes Back*. Hoth is under siege, and it's clear that the rebels are going to lose. Their snow speeders are cool-looking, but they can't do anything against the massive AT-AT walkers advancing toward the base.


As usual, Luke Skywalker saves the day. Instead of trying to beat the Imperial walkers with brute force, he attacks their weaknesses with cunning and ingenuity. After downing one AT-AT by tripping it up with his tow cable, he destroys another using nothing but his grappling hook and lightsaber. The battle isn't won—Hoth was a lost cause from the start—but Luke was able to buy the rebels enough time to evacuate and regroup.


*Battle for Zendikar* reminds me a lot of the rebels' valiant stand on Hoth. Facing overwhelming odds and horrific enemies, the Zendikari will have to rely on creative tactics if they're going to have any hope of reclaiming their homeland.


It's Zendikar vs. Eldrazi Week on DailyMTG, and I refuse to believe that the war has been lost. Let's take a look at some of the cards in *Battle for Zendikar* and see if we can piece together a winning strategy for what remains of the Zendikari Allies.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lavastep+Raider)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavastep+Raider) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hedron+Blade)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Blade)
I love the story being told through these two cards. The Goblins decided to use hedrons as spear tips simply because they're pointy and Zendikar has a ton of them lying around. Eventually, they realized that hedrons are imbued with magic that works against the Eldrazi.


Later on, a more advanced group of Zendikari (A Kor? Munda, perhaps?) seems to have perfected that technology and augmented it into a sword.


I love that [Hedron Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Blade) only works when you're on the offensive—if you're being proactive against the Eldrazi menace, you can kill them with this sword. If you wait around for them to attack you instead, it won't do you any good. That philosophy fits in well with what Gideon espoused in [The Survivors of Sky Rock](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/survivors-sky-rock-2015-09-09) as he urged the Sky Rock refugees to join him in taking back Sea Gate.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pathway+Arrows)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pathway+Arrows)
Even small pieces of hedron are effective against the Eldrazi. You can't kill an Eldrazi bigger than a Scion this way, but you can immobilize one to the point where it is no longer an immediate threat. It's not a long-term solution to the problem, but it's an important tool in the plane-wide fight.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Woodland+Wanderer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Wanderer)
The Elementals of Zendikar understand the power of the hedrons as well. The art and the flavor text on [Woodland Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Wanderer) imply that it understands its place in the fight and the tools that it must use to survive. It's unclear if [Woodland Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Wanderer) is just going to hurl that hedron at an Eldrazi or if it has a more advanced strategy in mind, but according to the flavor text its actions have piqued Gideon's interest.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Roil%27s+Retribution)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roil%27s+Retribution)
Zendikar was a dangerous world before the Eldrazi showed up, and it will remain one even if they are defeated. Rebels and underdogs have long used their environment to their advantage when facing an unfair fight, and it makes sense that the Zendikari would want to do this as well. The Roil probably isn't going to be much help in taking down the biggest Eldrazi, but this card can ambush four or five Scions without much of a problem.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Noyan+Dar%2C+Roil+Shaper)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noyan+Dar%2C+Roil+Shaper) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wave-Wing+Elemental)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wave-Wing+Elemental) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ondu+Rising)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+Rising)
We talked a little about awaken last week, and I'm excited to see how it comes into play as the story continues to unfold. Based on [Wave-Wing Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wave-Wing+Elemental)'s flavor text, it looks like Noyan Dar (and Nissa too, perhaps?) will enlist the land itself in the fight against the Eldrazi.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tightening+Coils)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tightening+Coils)
Let's spend a moment with [Tightening Coils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tightening+Coils), my favorite non-planeswalker card in *Battle for Zendikar*. [Lorthos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lorthos%2C+the+Tidemaker) may not be overtly represented in the set, but could that be who is assisting Kiora in her fight against Ulamog? Kiora's latest planeswalker card makes three 8/8 Octopus creatures, and I'd like to believe that one of them is everybody's favorite Tidemaker.


We know that Kiora doesn't defeat Ulamog all on her own here—giving a creature -6/-0 isn't going to defeat The Ceaseless Hunger, no matter what—but you've got to love her chutzpah. Walking up to the most evil thing on the plane and asking your cephalopod friend to help you tie him to a rock takes guts.


The other thing I love about [Tightening Coils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tightening+Coils) is that it feels like a subtle nod to the flavor complaints that some of us had with [Pin to the Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pin+to+the+Earth). [Tightening Coils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tightening+Coils) is almost a faithful reprint, especially considering it also involves Thassa's Bident, but this time the creature being enchanted actually loses flying. Good job, Wizards!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/Zen-Hero-Spread.png)


There's a moment in every great underdog story where several warring factions are forced to band together in order to defeat the ultimate evil. In *Battle for Zendikar*, this is depicted through the converge and Ally mechanics.


During the first *Zendikar* block, Allies were supposed to represent a diverse group of adventurers working together. A good Allies deck was supposed to evoke something like a successful *Dungeons & Dragons* party. This time around, the word "Ally" takes on an added poignancy. The word no longer describes a loose group of adventurers searching for treasure—it's depicting the last survivors of a destroyed world fighting for their homeland. The Allies might not seem like much compared to the likes of Ulamog, but Zendikar would be lost without their cooperation.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stasis+Snare)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Quarantine+Field)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarantine+Field) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aligned+Hedron+Network)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aligned+Hedron+Network)
At last, we come to the Allies' true weapon against the Eldrazi. Jace might not like the idea of imprisoning the Eldrazi instead of killing them—we'll have to wait and see how that plays out in the next set—but it looks to me like this is Zendikar's best hope.


From a gameplay perspective, all three of these cards perfectly illustrate the tension between Jace and Ugin's differing viewpoints. All three cards can take out an Eldrazi—heck, all three are capable of taking out Ulamog himself—but none of them are able to do so permanently. If your hedrons are destroyed later on, the Eldrazi you were fighting are coming back. Is this the best way to save Zendikar? Is it the only way to save Zendikar? Will it even work?


I honestly don't know. It's best to let the flavor text on [Hedron Archive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Archive) speak for itself.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hedron+Archive)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Archive)
What I do know is how to build a deck designed to defend Zendikar against the Eldrazi menace. If you're looking to retake Sea Gate, you'll want to rock something like this:

There are quite a few ways to build an effective Zendikari deck. I decided to stick with just three colors so I could at least hope to cast all my spells. But if you're lucky enough to open a bunch of the new lands, you might want to consider running four or even all five colors. It was really hard to leave [Munda, Ambush Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Munda%2C+Ambush+Leader) out of this deck, and I'm dying to build an awaken deck around [Noyan Dar, Roil Shaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noyan+Dar%2C+Roil+Shaper) at some point. [March from the Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+from+the+Tomb) is another great card that should give you plenty of reinforcements on your journey back to Sea Gate, and it seems wrong to leave out [Drana](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drana%2C+Liberator+of+Malakir) and her Vampires entirely. You could even consider running [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) if you really want to stick it to the Eldrazi.


We take our victories where we can get them, though, and for now it seems as though Zendikar and its citizens have a chance to win. It might not feel that way the next time you're face-to-face with a 10/10 indestructible titan, but you've got to keep the faith.
