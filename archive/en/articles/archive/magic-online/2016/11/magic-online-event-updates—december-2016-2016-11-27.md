Magic Online Event Updates—December 2016
========================================

Changes to New to *Magic Online* Events
=======================================


For New to *Magic Online* events, we want to take existing *Magic* players (from either *Magic Duels* or paper *Magic*) and familiarize them with the *Magic Online* platform. So we offer New to *Magic Online* events that can be joined with some of the 20 New Player Points that are given to players when they create their accounts.


Starting December 7, we are eliminating the five-card boosters and replacing the prizes in the New to *Magic Online* events with Play Points. The Sealed events, which were scheduled, fired rarely, and we want players to be able to get used to the Draft scene in a relatively safe way. As a result, we're focusing these events on a two-player Standard queue, and a four-player Phantom Draft League. Here are the full details for both events:


**New to *Magic Online* Standard**


**Location:** Play Lobby -> Constructed -> Tournaments


**Format:** Standard


**Entry Options:**


* 2 New Player Points

**Number of Players:** 2


**Structure:** One best-of-three match


**Prize Structure:**


* Winner: 5 Play Points

**New to *Magic Online* Phantom Draft League**


**Location:** Play Lobby -> Limited -> Leagues


**Format:** Standard


**Entry Options:**


* 4 New Player Points

**Structure:** Draft, then play up to two best-of-three matches at your convenience


**Prize Structure:**


* 2 wins: 10 Play Points
* 1 win: 5 Play Points

Year of Modern Flashbacks Comes to a Close
==========================================


The Year of Modern flashbacks is closing out strong:


* Nov. 30–Dec. 7: 3 *Return to Ravnica*
* Dec. 7–14: 3 *Gatecrash*
* Dec. 14–21: 1 *Dragon's Maze*, 1 *Gatecrash*, 1 *Return to Ravnica*
* Dec. 21–28: 3 *Magic 2014*

The *Return to Ravnica* block was very popular, so I hope to see you in the queues! (I'll probably be in either Boros or Rakdos.)
