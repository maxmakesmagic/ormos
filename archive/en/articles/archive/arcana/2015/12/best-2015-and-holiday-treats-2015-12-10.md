Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






With the holidays upon us, the crew at DailyMTG and the rest of Wizards of the Coast is going to be taking a bit of a break. But that doesn't mean there's nothing going on for you, gentle reader.


First, as we do every year, we'll be revisiting the year's best work on our website with two Best of 2015 weeks, starting December 14 and running through December 25. During that time, we'll revisit the best stuff our writers have created during 2015â€”all of which you may or may not have read, but definitely should have. We'll return with the official start of *Oath of the Gatewatch* previews on December 28.


Also going on over the holidays, [*Vintage Cube*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/holiday-cube-now-vintage-cube-2015-12-07) returns to *Magic Online*! If you haven't experienced the *Vintage Cube*, formerly called the *Holiday Cube*, then you haven't played *Magic* as it was never intended to be played. Chock-full of the most powerful, most bannable, most restrictable (totally not a word, but run with it) cards the game has ever seen, in an awesome Draft format. If you've ever wanted to draft [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) and [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), here's your chance!


That's for our entrenched fans. For those of you just starting out, we have another treat for you: the entire Level One course by Reid Duke in e-book form! Click below to download.

Additionally, there might be a few surprises, both on DailyMTG and around the internet. Tomorrow marks the start of the [World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-world-magic-cup-event-information), and with that will come some hints and surprises about what we've got in store for 2016, including, yes, some *Oath of the Gatewatch* information.


In fact, we might sneak a tidbit or two onto this very site along the way. We'll see how the holiday spirit moves me.


Today, fortunately for you, I'm in quite the giving spirit, so I thought we'd give you a taste of what's to come. When you visit your local store for the *Oath of the Gatewatch* Prerelease the weekend of January 16, you're going to get a Prerelease pack that contains, well, these:

What will be inside those packs? Well, that you'll have to wait and see. 'Tis the season of surprises, after all.


Happy Holidays from everyone here at Wizards of the Coast!
