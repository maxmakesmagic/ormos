The eccentric Canadian deckbuilder Jim Roy has garnered a bit of a following online. Rather than follow traditional "four-of" consistency, Jim opts instead for what he calls "threat diversity," which is a fancy way of saying he has tons of different cards in his decks. Friday's concoction is a black-blue midrange deck that appears to be built around [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). Among its 23 unique nonland cards are [Azami, Lady of Scrolls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azami%2C+Lady+of+Scrolls); [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top); [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal); [Izzet Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Guildmage); [Muddle the Mixture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture); [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty); and multiple Dragons. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthon06/fm5_roy.jpg)*Jim Roy's deck features 23 unique non-land cards*


His opponent is Arnost Zidek, currently the Czech Republic's best player. Zidek is running a relatively straightforward Gruul deck with plenty of burn. Zidek arrived at his list playtesting with his countrymen and France's Ruel brothers.


### Game 1


Roy had what looked to be all the answers early on. He played Threads on Zidek's [Gruul Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Guildmage), which was subsequently [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ed. A [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) came down for Zidek and picked up [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) before swinging in, but Roy was on the case and transmuted [Muddle the Mixture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) for his own Jitte. Roy's continually untapped [Quicksand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksand) was also making life difficult for Zidek.


Zidek, for his part, wasn't drawing any more creatures and had to lean on his lone [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) for the bulk of his offense. It looked grim when Roy finally found land number five and summoned forth Meloku, but Zidek had two more [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s at the ready. [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) No. 2 arrived on the scene shortly thereafter and Roy quickly found himself at 10 life.


With little else to do, Roy cast back-to-back [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant)s. Combined with [Quicksand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksand), "Bob" could take out a [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), so attacking was not an automatic for Zidek. In fact, he decided to just pass and see if the Confidants would do the dirty work for him.


"*[Keiga, the Tide Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star)*," said the first Bob during Roy's upkeep. "*[Hinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder)*," said the second. And like that, the Canadian was at 1 life. A [Char](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char) off the top for Zidek ended the game. And that, kids, is why putting six-mana cards in the [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) deck is dubious at best.


Zidek 1 - Roy 0


### Game 2


If there's one thing that Jim Roy decks do well, it is confuse opponents who are trying to sideboard. After much head-scratching, Zidek opted to side in [Genju of the Spires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Spires) and [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize), and then slipped in two [Giant Solifuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge)s at the last second, later noting that, "You [Roy] have to tap out so much that I can get these [Solifuges] to resolve."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthon06/fm5_zidek.jpg)*A consistent Gruul attack powered Zidek to the win*
Among Roy's sideboarded cards was [Seize the Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seize+the+Soul), a little-played silver bullet that absolutely annihilates green, blue, and/or red creature decks.


Zidek began Game 2 with a Llanowar Elf, and Roy one-upped him with a turn-two [Izzet Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Guildmage) played off of the painful duo of [Waterveil Cavern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waterveil+Cavern) (really) and Underground River. The Guildmage was removed from play, as were Zidek's Elf and subsequent [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), but [Rumbling Slum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rumbling+Slum) resolved and Zidek also had managed to sneak a Genju onto his only [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain).


Roy was holding a handful of expensive spells and had to tap out in the face of the Slum and Genju just to [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) for four lands. With the door open, Zidek dropped a Solifuge, putting the game way out of reach for Roy.


Final Result


Zidek 2 - Roy 0


Although Roy's deck contains many little tricks and synergies, it looked to require just a bit too much luck to come together quick enough to handle the consistency of Zidek's Gruul army.
