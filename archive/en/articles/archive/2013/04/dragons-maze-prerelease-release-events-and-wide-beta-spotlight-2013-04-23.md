Dragon's Maze Prerelease, Release Events, and Wide Beta Spotlight

Ten Guilds, One Set
-------------------


The *Dragon's Maze* set is the final in the *Return to Ravnica* block, the long-awaited return to the city-plane of Ravnica and its ten ancient two-color guilds. Five of those guilds were featured in the *Return to Ravnica* set, and the remaining five guilds were featured in the *Gatecrash* set. The *Dragon's Maze* set features all ten of the two-color guilds that define the city-plane of Ravnica, together in one package for the first time ever. With every guild represented, you’ll find many more amazing multicolored cards in this set than in a typical **Magic** set.


Once again, players are asked to declare their allegiance by selecting one of the  [ten Guild Marks](/en/node/640376) from throughout the *Return to Ravnica* block. For **Magic Online**, the Guild Marks are used as part of the entry for the *Dragon's Maze* Prerelease Sealed Deck Queues. Players can purchase the untradeable Guild Marks from the **Magic Online** Store for $5.00 USD, from 1:00 PM on Wednesday, May 8, until 10:00 AM on Monday, May 13.


Once a player has chosen a guild and purchased a Guild Mark, that player can use it, along with 20 Event Tickets, to enter the *Dragon's Maze* Prerelease Sealed Deck Queues. Players will receive 4 *Dragon's Maze* booster packs, 1 guild-specific booster pack that matches their Guild Mark, and 1 "secret ally" guild booster pack. Players will not be able to choose their “secret ally,” but it will be one of the guilds from the opposite set release that shares a color with the Guild Mark used to enter the Prerelease Sealed Deck Queue. Unlike previous Prereleases in the block, Guild booster packs will not contain a Guild promo card.


Hover over any Guild flag to see what their "secret ally" Guilds are:

Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the *Dragon's Maze* Release Events Championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in any end-of-season championship or championship event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s).


Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [Magic Online User Agreement](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/%20http:/wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). If you play in **Magic Online** events, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established.


It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that he or she has been properly entered into this event and is able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the Championship, he or she will need to contact customer service for assistance.


**For all *Dragon's Maze* Release Events, Wizards of the Coast may modify, suspend, and/or cancel an event, substitute prizes, or change the costs and/or schedule for an event without notice, at its sole discretion.**
