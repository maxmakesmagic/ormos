The red and green Beasts in Otaria are quite recognizable, but what about the blue ones?


Artist Arnie Swekel was given the task of coming up with a concept sketch for such a monstrosity, and here's what he came up with:


The Creative team liked it so much, that they ended up using it on a card in *Legions*. The card is Riptide Mangler, and it also appears as the art on one of the *Legions* booster packs.


What does it do? You'll have to wait and see.


Also, look for an interview with Arnie Swekel by Toby Wachter coming up soon on MagicTheGathering.com.
