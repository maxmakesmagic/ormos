The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 14, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [the full *Amonkhet* Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/amonkhet), which is now available!


What to Watch TODAY
===================


1. > 
> FYI. This Friday at 11:00AM Pacific, we proudly present, in partnership with [@wizards\_magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic), the Amonkhet PrePreRelease![#MTGAKH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGAKH?src=hash) [#LRRAKH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LRRAKH?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/0UMNwlLrtx](https://t.co/0UMNwlLrtx)

Do what the tweet says. I'm sure your boss won't mind. Or, better yet, take the day off! Call in sick! Invite your boss to watch with you!


What? Doesn't everyone have a *Magic*-playing boss? Is that not normal?


1. > 
> Amonkhet Spoiler discussion today at 2PM EST with [@HueyJensen](https://twitter.com/HueyJensen) and [@AndrewCuneo](https://twitter.com/AndrewCuneo) on twitch. What cards would you like to see them cover?
> 
> 
>  — PantheonMagic (@PantheonMagic) [April 14, 2017](https://twitter.com/PantheonMagic/status/852890332756881408)

If you're able to watch more than one stream at once, at the same time as the LoadingReadyRun Pre-Prerelease, William Jensen and Andrew Cuneo will be talking *Amonkhet* on [twitch.tv/pantheonmagic](https://www.twitch.tv/pantheonmagic).


What to Do This Weekend
=======================


1. [*Magic* Open House](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/magic-open-house)

Here's the deal with *Magic* Open House—it's an event for players new to the game, returning to the game, or for experienced players who want to get their friends into the game. Show up, get a Welcome Deck, and start learning! Or teaching! (If you're reading this, you're probably on the teaching end of things). For more details or a way to find a store near you, check out [this helpful web page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/magic-open-house).


And if you or a friend are partaking, you can send them the link to this video to get them started:

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. Two Top 10s

I enjoy a good Top X list, especially when a new set comes out, and we have a pair of them today. Shaheen Soorani on StarCityGames.com focuses on the [Top 10 control cards coming out of *Amonkhet*](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34926_The-Top-10-Control-Cards-In-Amonkhet.html), and his list is basically just "Top 10 cards Blake is going to try," so he was a shoo-in to make the update. [Ben Friedman on Gathering Magic also has a Top 10 list](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/benfriedman-04142017-spoiler-season/), but his covers the 10 most impactful cards from the set as a whole. You won't believe what's at number 3!


Actually, you probably will. It's a very potent card.


1. [Liliana, Death's Majesty: The Return of Solar Flare?](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/liliana-deaths-majesty-the-return-of-solar-flare/) | ChannelFireball | Matt Sperling

Ah, Solar Flare, the oddly named Esper deck that liked to discard [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair) and then return it with [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify). Sperling thinks the basic idea might be due for a comeback with the printing of Liliana, Death's Majesty—also known as [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) plus planeswalker. Oketra knows I'll try it once or five times.


1. [Spoilers and Clues to *Amonkhet*'s Story](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/04/spoilers-clues-amonkhets-story/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Beck Holden

What story bits can you glean from the *Amonkhet* Story Spotlight cards? Or other cards, for that matter? Holden thinks he has a line on some future plot developments by reading between the lines. Whether he does—well, you'll just have to stay tuned.


1. [Amondecks!](https://soundcloud.com/user-121566285/gam-e30-amondecks) | GAM Podcast | Gerry Thompson and Michael Majors

Thompson and Majors start looking at ten different decks for *Amonkhet* Standard—yes, ten different decks. Start filling up your brain space will all the possibilities this new set brings with it.


1. [Nissa, Steward of Elements Will Get You for 10](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/nissa-steward-elements/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

Chapin and Flores do what they do best—pick a powerful card, dissect it in every which way they can, and rave about its possibility. And with Nissa, Steward of Elements, there is quite a bit of possibility.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Married to the Game](https://soundcloud.com/mttgmtg/getting-to-know-you) | Athena, Jennifer, and Jamie

A new podcast emerges! You've probably heard, read, or watched something previously done by these three content creators—Athena does much of the work behind the scenes for Vintage Super League (and various other Super Leagues), Jennifer is better known as [Mrs. Mulligan](https://twitter.com/TheMrsMulligan), and Jamie is an [avid streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/jamietopples). The three have joined up to create their own podcast, now in its second episode. Their perspectives are fresh and fun and certainly make this podcast worth checking out.


Synergy of the Day
==================


1. Drakes, Drakes Everywhere

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_t6yotWeUHz.png)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oath+of+Jace)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Jace) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cathartic+Reunion)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathartic+Reunion)
Yes, everyone is going to be trying Drake Haven with all the cool cycling cards we have available to us now (myself included), but don't miss the "or discard" text on the powerful enchantment. [Oath of Jace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Jace) has seen some scattered play by control mages along the way, and it nets you three cards plus two discards—which can now be turned into 2/2 fliers. Or, branching out into red, [Cathartic Reunion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathartic+Reunion) has the same immediate effect as [Oath of Jace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Jace) (basically), but costs one mana less. Tack on a mere two mana more and those spells suddenly come with Drakes.


I also need to give a shout to the most commented on synergy of yesterday—[a hypothetical turn-three kill in Standard](https://i.redd.it/f4s4auyagcry.png). It's a bit much but, hey, someone, somewhere, will try it.
