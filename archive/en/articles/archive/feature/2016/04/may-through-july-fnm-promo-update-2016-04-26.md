 Katie is a copy editor and occasional writer for DailyMTG, as well as a longtime Magic player with a fondness for giant green creatures. She especially loves Commander, despite having the patience of a fruit fly, and might glare at you if your turn takes too long. 






It's almost May, so it's time to announce the promos that Friday Night *Magic* players can look forward to over the next three months. They are shiny, and soon they can all be yours.


**May**


Fun fact: Mark Zug had only ever painted one Goblin before in his illustrious *Magic* career: [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade). For May's FNM promo, however, Zug has put his spin on maybe *the* Goblin—[Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief). Truly a terror when it was in Standard, Warchief can now terrorize even more tabletops as May positively rains Zug's new vision of the Warchief on FNMs everywhere.

**June**


Looking for something? Well, if that something is a land (that's right, *any* land), [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) will help you find it—with new art from Christine Choi.

**July**


Play in an FNM this July, and this could be you! Wait, *yours*, not you. (Wizards of the Coast does not endorse, condone, or engage in freaky magical person-stretching.) This painful-looking take on [Spatial Contortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spatial+Contortion) from Joseph Meehan is July's promo card, and it's ready to twist your opponent's creatures into oblivion—or your own into damage-dealing monstrosities!
