**Occupation**: Bar Server / Blackjack Dealer / Student / Brad Barn


**Previous Magic accomplishments**: A couple of PT Cashes, 4-time State Champion, One SCG Open Title.


**What did you play this weekend and why?** Green-White Aggro/ mostly because Brad liked it and its good matchups are Abzan/Red-White, which I figured would be a good chunk of the field.


**What did you expect the metagame to look like this weekend, and were those expectations met?** Green-White, Red-White, and a lot of Abzan, pretty accurate. Played 7 Abzan.


**In hindsight, if you could exchange any card in your deck for one other card, what would it be and why?**Something for [Temur Sabertooth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Sabertooth) for the mirror.


**What was the most surprising card you saw cast this weekend?**[Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant). Wrecked my face.
