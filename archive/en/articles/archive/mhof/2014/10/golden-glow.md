Welcome to the multicolored (aka gold) wing of the Multiplayer Hall of Fame! This wing of the hall celebrates the colors working together to make some of the most fantastic and loved cards in *Magic*'s history. Keep your shades on and don't stare directly at the cards. They shine brightly!

[Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) | Art by [Christopher Moeller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Christopher Moeller%22])


The multicored wing offered the most room for expansion, starting out with fewer than the 40 cards that were in each of the WUBRG wings. Multicolroed cards weren't always so amazing and plentiful, and the early hall demonstrated that. The second half of *Magic*'s existence brought many more multicolored cards and saw the power of those cards rise dramatically. The multicolored section of the hall has seen more changes than anywhere else.


The Cards
=========


Multiplayer Animal Rankings


**Rattlesnake**—These cards tell opponents to bother somebody who is not you.


**Gorilla**—They make an immediate impact on the game.


**Spider**—They surprise opponents in the nastiest ways.


**Pigeon**—They get better with more players.


**Plankton**—They give everybody resources like mana and life and cards.


**Cockroach**—They can't be kept down, providing good value.



You can [click here](/node/282761) to see the entire list of cards, but I wanted to talk about a few of my favorites here.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirrorweave)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave)
**Mirrorweave** 


[Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) is the type of card people tend to disregard at first glance. If every creature becomes a copy of the target creature, then my opponents are getting the benefit too. Why is that good? It isn't until you play against it that you realize just what a star [Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) can be. If all the creatures on the battlefield become unblockable until the end of the turn, suddenly your attack is amazing. One [Pathrazer of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pathrazer+of+Ulamog) and your six creatures are destroying eighteen enemy permanents and hitting for 66 damage. [Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) comes out of nowhere, deserving its 8 rating in the spider category.


I also like [Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) in other situations. If you are being attacked, you can wreck an opponent's attacks by making everything into a small or big creature, whichever works for you. [Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) is another card that messes with others' combat. When Aaron attacks Carl, a carefully targeted [Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) can leave both sides destroyed.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ink-Treader Nephilim)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Treader Nephilim)
**Ink-Treader Nephilim** 


[Ink-Treader Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Treader+Nephilim) just turns games completely on their head. The ability to target multiple creatures with a spell that should only be able to target one creature makes the most innocent card crazy broken. I've had multiple opponents run the Ink-Treader and I'm reluctant to even try and stop them because I want to see what kind of insanity will ensue:


Whole boards of creatures stolen; all creatures destroyed; or turning all lands into 1/1 creatures, then dealing a point of damage to every creature.


All of this is for huge discounts, since you are only supposed to be targeting one creature.


No other card in the multicolored wing benefits from multiple opponents the way [Ink-Treader Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Treader+Nephilim) does. Once the card hits play, you need to eliminate it or expect things to go very badly for you. Just remember, your targeted removal targets every one of your creatures too!


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Edric, Spymaster of Trest)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edric, Spymaster of Trest)
**Edric, Spymaster of Trest** 


Edric is one of my favorite cards of all time. Edric was one of the first cards to overtly reward your opponents for attacking elsewhere. It does it so well, it gets the top marks in the hall for aiding the other players. What better way to help your fellow players than give them more cards? If all they have to do is attack someone else, then that is barely a price to pay at all!


Edric can be a focus of a deck or a supporting player, depending on what else you want going on with your deck. The card itself is nonthreatening, aiding the feeling that attacking elsewhere makes the most sense. Other players understand the practical side when you attack them, explaining that you are only doing it to draw an extra card.


This is also the subtlety of the card: it encourages attacking. Many multiplayer games are endless because players won't attack. Edric offers a subtle yet powerful reason to turn your creatures sideways.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prophet of Kruphix)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet of Kruphix)
**Prophet of Kruphix** 


While Edric is like a feather or the scent of chocolate, drawing opponents in one direction, [Prophet of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet+of+Kruphix) has become the sledgehammer, demanding a response. The Prophet often shifts games from multiplayer chaos games into all-against-one. The ability to untap on each upkeep and play creatures as though they had flash can, in the right decks, make games where one deck can almost compete against three or four. The litany of cards that work well with the Prophet includes cards that attack or have some ability that involves tapping. Hundreds of cards work with the Prophet.


This has caused a love/hate relationship for [Prophet of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet+of+Kruphix). With all the options, deck building is a blast. You can try most anything and see how it works. The hate comes because it can so easily create degeneracy with cards that initially seemed so innocent. Many players love the card in their games, while others rail that it is not banned in Commander.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pernicious Deed)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious Deed)
**Pernicious Deed** 


[Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) was the number one card in the multicolored wing until this update, but don't be fooled, as the Deed is the definition of a multiplayer card. One of the best things a card can do in multiplayer games is encourage people to attack elsewhere, since your single resource (a solitary card) means your opponents do your job for you by taking each other out. No card in the multicolored wing does this better than the Deed. Once the card is on the battlefield, it's there like an Eastern European enforcer, leaning against the wall at a bar. He's looking at you, with his dark suit, his dead eyes staring through you. When he gives you that subtle shake of the head when you start talking to that girl at the bar, you move on. You don't argue with him, and you don't try to explain that you just want to talk to her. You just move on.


[Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) can be activated at instant speed. It is flexible enough that it can just get rid of a mass of tokens, it can wipe the board clean, or it give you something in between. It may require black and green to use, but it has been providing its services for a long time, and it has been feared and effective for just as long.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gisela, Blade of Goldnight)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela, Blade of Goldnight)
**Gisela, Blade of Goldnight** 


Gisela earned the top spot in the multicolored wing by being strong in multiple categories. She discourages your opponents from attacking you, since the attack has to be overwhelmingly in their favor to actually win. If they attack each other, the numbers are all doubled, so any creature that gets through can do serious damage. Gisela's ability effectively makes her a 10/10 and makes all your creatures into powerhouses. Gisela forces everyone to change their strategies.


Gisela's ability stretches across multiple animal categories. While the rattlesnake and gorilla aspects are clear, she also provides some cockroach ability, as your creatures are twice as difficult to kill.


Gisela has mostly flown under my radar, but consider this my wakeup call. Gisela will be showing up in many of my decks to come!


I Love Dragons, Don't You?
==========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon Broodmother)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon Broodmother)
**Dragon Broodmother** 


I like this card, but I didn't think it would make the hall. A 4/4 Dragon that makes Dragons is nice, but not nearly as powerful as other cards out there. The key to the Broodmother is that it makes the Dragons on each upkeep, not just your own, pushing the pigeon rating on the card way up. When you understand that the Dragon tokens have devour, giving it the highest cockroach rating in the multicolored section of the hall, the strength of the card goes through the roof. A game with four opponents can look like this:





1. Play the Broodmother on your turn.
2. On first opponent's turn, make a 1/1 Dragon token.
3. On second opponent's turn, make a 3/3 Dragon token by devouring the first token.
4. On third opponent's turn, make a 1/1 Dragon token.
5. On fourth opponent's turn, make a 3/3 Dragon token by devouring the 1/1 token.
6. On your turn, make a 1/1 token and attack with a 4/4 and two 3/3 tokens in the air.

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon+Broodmother)



















The deck runs several other golden Hall of Fame cards:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragonlair Spider)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlair Spider)
**Dragonlair Spider** 


When I play with [Dragon Broodmother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Broodmother), I like to make 5/5 tokens, since they tend to get out of range quickly. I also prefer eating Eldrazi Spawn and 1/1 green Insect creature tokens from [Dragonlair Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlair+Spider). The Spider says to opponents, "Thank you for playing all those spells. The next time you try to attack me, I should have about a bajillion spiders over here." The [Dragonlair Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlair+Spider) is built for multiplayer games. More opponents means more spells and more token creatures. While I like to sacrifice them, you might prefer to play [Coat of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms) and just make them huge. [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) and cards of its ilk are also handy ways to use all the Insect tokens.


By the way, almost everyone assumes the Insect tokens have reach. They don't. While your opponents might be fooled, be sure you aren't. Moving to block a flier with all your Insect tokens just isn't going to work the way you want it to.


Tons of Spiders. Heeby jeebies. Why would you attack someone with spiders?!


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zhur-Taa Ancient)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhur-Taa Ancient)
**Zhur-Taa Ancient** 


The deck has plenty of expensive creatures and needs a lot of mana. [Zhur-Taa Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zhur-Taa+Ancient) helps that along, doubling up the mana from the lands in play. Other players love the Ancient as well, as it doubles all the mana from their lands as well. The difference is that the Ancient comes with a huge 7/5 body. In this deck, the Ancient will mostly be sitting back and playing defense unless players forget about those [Kessig Wolf Run](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run)s, then suddenly all that mana will make the Ancient into a game-winning trampler.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rith, the Awakener)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rith, the Awakener)
**Rith, the Awakener** 


Rith is another Hall of Famer setting up residence in the deck. Rith is another Dragon, and that works well with [Scourge of Valkas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourge+of+Valkas). Rith gives you plenty of Saprolings for the [Dragon Broodmother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Broodmother)'s offspring to munch on. Not that Rith needs any of these cards to be a powerhouse; just give her multiple opponents. Finding the opponent who can't block her is easier with multiple opponents. Once Rith swings in, she gives you Saprolings based on the number of permanents in a color on the *entire battlefield*. If Rith gets to swing a second time, the Saproling count starts to go crazy. I've been in games where the Saprolings were well over a hundred, since they start to count themselves. Rith's talents stretch over several categories, putting her in the Top 5 of the multicolored wing.


I hope you enjoyed your walk through the golden wing of the Multiplayer Hall of Fame!
