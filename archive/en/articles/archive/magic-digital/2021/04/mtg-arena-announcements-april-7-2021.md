Didn't we tell you? Our State of the Game updates aren't going anywhere! If you haven't seen our latest yet, [be sure to check it out](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-strixhaven-school-mages-2021-04-07). But we've still got a couple updates and new events to share, so let's dive right in.


Store Updates
=============


It's time for some back-to-school shopping! There are stickers, sleeves, and a cute little pup—we've got it all! These new bundles become available April 15, but how about a sneak peek? There are borderless planeswalkers, borderless Elder Dragons, and even *Strixhaven: School of Mages* stickers featuring Will, Rowan, and the inscrutable Professor Onyx.

But wait, there's more! Japanese alternate-art Mystical Archive Card Style bundles will also become available, each representing a different color. If you're interested in showing off to friends, the Forbidden Volumes bundle will feature the card styles for Mystical Archive cards that will be banned in Historic. Plus, additional card styles will be available through the upcoming Strixhaven College Cup—see the latest *State of the Game* for more info on that.

Remember that the Kasmina and Professor Onyx bundles are available now—you can use the new sleeves and pet right away—and if you haven't already, be sure to pick up your free Thopter pet when you first login from an Android or iOS device. Don't let it fly away!
