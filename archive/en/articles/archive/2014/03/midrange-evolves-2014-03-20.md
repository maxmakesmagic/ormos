With the *Return to Ravnica* [shocklands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=shocklands) in Standard, it also seems like the possible combinations of strategies is endless. First, we had some WB and BR Midrange decks, then those basically became Mono-Black Devotion. After that, Esper Humans showed the world the power of Whip of Erebos + Obzedat, Ghost Council.



![Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thoughtseize&options=)This deck is a kind of a mish-mash of all of them. Red gives you access to Rakdos Keyrune, a solid beater and accelerator; in addition to a cheaper, albeit sorcery-speed Hero's Downfall in Dreadbore; and a potential late-game board wipe in Mizzium Mortars. It's also worth noting that Mizzium Mortars can kill Blood Baron of Vizkopa, one of the best cards in the mirror match.

On top of that, Naota's deck features Pack Rat and sideboard all-stars like Anger of the Gods, Rakdos's Return, and Sire of Insanity. Is this the new evolution of black-based midrange in Standard?
