Did you know that the expansion symbol matters? It does! As it says in the Comprehensive Rules,


> 109.3. An object’s *characteristics*  are name, mana cost, color, card type, subtype, supertype, **expansion symbol**, rules text, abilities, power, toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, and life modifier. Objects can have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isn’t a characteristic. For example, characteristics don’t include whether a permanent is tapped, a spell’s target, an object’s owner or controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.

This means that if a card is copied, the copy will have the same expansion symbol. Why is the symbol a game-relevant thing? It's because of just three cards.

Of course, once something weird is embedded in the rules, it's fair game for *Un-* cards. Which means that three more cards were created in *Unhinged* to take advantage of rule 109.3.

Since the original [Morphling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling) could do just about everything, the comedy version got to do even more than everything, including the ability to change its artist or expansion symbol. In an all-*Unhinged* game, that could actually come in handy, thanks to...

![World-Bottling Kit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=World-Bottling+Kit)  
...the explicit reference to [City in a Bottle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+in+a+Bottle)!

![Symbol Status](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Symbol+Status)  
Finally, there's [Symbol Status](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbol+Status), which is kind of like a domain spell, but for expansion symbols. Let's blow up the art and see which expansion symbols are running around in there.

From left to right, there's the symbols for *Onslaught* (a morph spider), *Mercadian Masques* (a mask), *Urza's Destiny* (a beaker), *Fallen Empires* (a crown), *Torment* (a coiled serpent), and *Visions* (a capital V, or the [Triangle of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triangle+of+War)). And then the card itself has an *Unhinged* symbol with legs!

However, that's only the expansion symbols with legs. There's also *Alliances* (the flag held by *Torment*) and *The Dark* (the moon). And technically,the fire in the center, while it wasn't an expansion symbol at the time, is now the symbol for *[Fire & Lightning](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/pdsfirelightning/productinfo)*!
