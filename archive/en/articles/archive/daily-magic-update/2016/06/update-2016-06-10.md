The June 10, 2016 update

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on June 10, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Grand Prix Prague](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppra16)—coming to a computer screen near you this weekend.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [Grand Prix Prague](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppra16)

This will be a fun one. Not only is it a Legacy Grand Prix on the heels of *Eternal Masters*. Not only are we providing video coverage. But we're also trying out [a new video coverage format](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/more-rptq-decks-plus-prague-and-columbus-2016-06-09) that's intended to provide more coverage of what you want to see—*Magic* being played.


Coverage starts at 10 a.m. local time (CET)/1 a.m. PT/4 a.m. ET/8 a.m. UTC on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


After That, Everyone Talks About Legacy and *Eternal Masters*
=============================================================


1. [My Top 4 Picks for the Legacy GP Weekend](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/my-top-3-picks-for-the-legacy-gp-weekend/) | ChannelFireball | Caleb Durward

Caleb Durward knows Legacy. It's long been the format where he's found the most success, and he's been a stalwart of Legacy for a long time. Heck, he's basically the one responsible for getting [Survival of the Fittest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) banned. So when he picks his top four decks, you should probably listen.


1. [Limited Resources 340—*Eternal Masters* Primer](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-340-eternal-masters-primer/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

It's here! It's finally here! And since it is here, Marshall and Luis are on deck with a primer for drafting the set. They know these cards forward and backward, so for the best tips and tricks as the set releases, this is the podcast to turn to.


1. [Channel Cheon—Legacy Eldrazi](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-cheon-legacy-eldrazi/) | ChannelFireball | Paul Cheon

Pay attention kids, this is the new challenger on the Legacy block, and you should fully expect to see it out in full force this weekend. Get a sense of what the newest player can do in Legacy before this weekend gets going.


1. [Observations on *Eternal Masters* Removal](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/observations-on-eternal-masters-removal) | MTGGoldfish | Sameer Merchant

One day after providing the definitive guide to removal in *Eternal Masters*, Sameer Merchant drops some more knowledge bombs on those eagerly awaiting the new set with a series of observations on the removal. If you want a side of analysis with your spreadsheet, then reading this follow-up is a must.


1. [Probably Playing Karakas](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/karakas/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

Sure, the Top Level duo start on Standard. There was just a Grand Prix in the format, after all. But Legacy is the real name of the game as Chapin explains why he's, well, probably playing [Karakas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas) in whatever deck he plays this weekend. At least with *Eternal Masters* coming out today (oh, have you not heard?), he'll have plenty of opportunities to find one.


1. [What to Play in Legacy](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33074_What-To-Play-In-Legacy.html) | StarCityGames.com | Adrian Sullivan

This in-depth article explains several of the most prominent Legacy decks, covering what makes them tick and what key decisions each will ask of its pilot. Adrian also discusses a few misconceptions many players have about Legacy as a format. It's a great primer for getting into the format, especially for players trying to decide which deck is right for them.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Don't Loot [CFB]](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4nbize/dont_loot_cfb/)

So this popped up again yesterday, and the conversation continued, even if [some players are ready to be done with it](https://twitter.com/HueyJensen/status/741082154994536448). Luis Scott-Vargas's [now-infamous Looter Problem](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/luis-scott-vargas/whats-the-play-the-looter-problem/) (Yes, capitalized now. It's earned that.) has spun up so much conversation that people are getting a bit sick of it. But here's the thing—thinking about it can make you a better *Magic* player. So I say let the conversation run. Let's have a new article about it every week. Let's sticky the thread on Reddit. Let's start a Twitter account called the Looter Problem. You can do this, internet. I believe in you.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. *Eternal Masters* Grixis Reanimator Sealed

Today's deck of the day is a little different. You won't find this on a tournament listing. It wasn't on stream, and it wasn't even legal to play in anything until today. But it is an example of some of the cool things in store when you play *Eternal Masters*.


This is my Sealed deck from the Wizards of the Coast internal Prerelease held yesterday, which I [tweeted about](https://twitter.com/blakepr/status/741061654931066882). I went 3-0 in the Sealed event without dropping a game, and the deck felt powerful the whole time, aptly demonstrating how synergies from one archetype can power up another.


In this case, the sweet blue-red spells and flashback archetype paired with blue-black reanimator to form a potent combination. More than once, [Extract from Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extract+from+Darkness) milled important flashback spells, and other times [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) cleared the way for the few creatures in the deck to attack. Additionally, [Pilgrim's Eye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilgrim%27s+Eye) not only fixed all three colors plus provided lands in the late game for [Oona's Grace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Grace) and [Dack Fayden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dack+Fayden).


There are a ton of different strategies in *Eternal Masters*, of which this is just one. Have fun exploring the format, as it's now in stores!
