By Adam Styborski




 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






What's next for *Magic: The Gathering*?


The future is full of amazing *Magic*, from returning to where it all began with [*Dominaria United*](https://magic.wizards.com/products/dominaria-united) on September 9—just in time to celebrate *Magic*'s 30th anniversary kickoff at [*Magic* 30, October 28–30 in Las Vegas](https://magic.gg/mtgfestivals/magic30)—to releasing [*Unfinity*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/unfinity-coming-october-7-2022-06-08) and the [Universes Beyond *Warhammer 40,000* collaboration](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/warhammer-40000-commander) even sooner on October 7.


And we're not done yet. Wizards Presents takes us through the home stretch of 2022 and beyond, revealing the next year of *Magic* and more:

Wizards Presents is packed with way more than we can recap here, but if you're looking for a rundown of the biggest details from the future of *Magic: The Gathering*, we've got you covered right here.


*Dominaria United*
==================


You've arrived back at *Magic*'s home: Dominaria.


And so have the Phyrexians. The plane faces an ages-old enemy, and every ally makes a difference.

*The Brothers' War*
===================


*Magic* story stays on Dominaria but takes us back to its distant past for the devastating conflict between brothers, Urza and Mishra, with *[The Brothers' War](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/)*.

The Next Year of *Magic*
========================


2022 may end with *The Brothers' War*, but the story doesn't stop there. *Magic* marches on with the Standard-legal sets across next year.


In the first quarter of 2023, we return to another plane—this time among the most dangerous of all.


![Phyrexia: All Will Be One set logo](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_mpHPd4K9qq.png)


*Phyrexia: All Will Be One* continues the *Magic* story where it left off in *The Brothers' War* as the battle against the Phyrexians of the modern *Magic* era heats up.



![Phyrexia: All Will Be One artwork](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/kqVEH3zOpS.jpg)Art by:  [Magali Villeneuve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Magali%20Villeneuve%22%5D)
Then, the drums of battle continue in the second quarter of 2023.


![March of the Machine set logo](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_6CqOPgCI59.png)


*March of the Machine* is the epic conclusion of the four-set story arc that began with *Dominaria United*—and ends with *Magic* forever changed.



![March of the Machine artwork](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/e1zfSYlQzh.jpg)Art by:  [Billy Christian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Billy%20Christian%22%5D)
How will *Magic* change? Once the dust settles, we'll take a closer look with *March of the Machine: The Aftermath*, a small set release providing an epilogue to the events, tying up loose ends of an incredible story arc.


![March of the Machine: The Aftermath set logo](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_uLtvmrglOj.png)


So where do we go next?


![Wilds of Eldraine logo](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_MoJN6zZK9S.png)


*\*Logo not yet final*


In the third quarter of 2023, the storybook world of Eldraine awaits as we venture beyond the kingdoms with *Wilds of Eldraine*, a return to a plane filled with fairy-tale wonder—and danger.



![Wilds of Eldraine artwork](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/IDkUfUIEa7.jpg)Art by:  [Magali Villeneuve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Magali%20Villeneuve%22%5D)
And adventure doesn't stop there for *Magic* next year.


![Lost Caverns of Ixalan logo](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_C11OGjnOve.png)


*\*Logo not yet final*


In the fourth quarter of 2023, we return to the plane packed with pirates (and dinosaurs) in *Lost Caverns of Ixalan*. We've seen the sea and land of Ixalan, but what lurks beneath?



![Lost Caverns of Ixalan artwork](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/GY4IevktLr.jpg)Art by:  [Alix Branwyn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Alix%20Branwyn%22%5D)
**More *Magic*—In-Store and Beyond—For 2023**
=============================================


Standard-legal sets aren't all you can look forward to for *Magic* in 2023. Whether you're a fan of unique Draft formats, clever Commander decks, or tales from the heart of high fantasy itself, *Magic* has you covered.


Our first stop is one more nod to *Magic*'s home with *[Dominaria Remastered](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/)*.


![Dominaria Remastered set logo](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_B3bRveluxP.png)


*Dominaria Remastered* reaches across *Magic*'s sets to bring together a mix of the familiar and nostalgic cards representing the breadth of Dominaria's history, from our earliest sets through to the modern day.

![Dominaria Remastered Collector Booster display](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_wzvi1LWL08.png)


*Dominaria Remastered* releases early in 2023 and will be available to play first at WPN Premium game store Preview Events one week prior to release. Plus, it will be available to preorder online at [Amazon](https://gtly.to/6yVyGT8gC) and at [your local game store](https://locator.wizards.com).


2023 also heralds the long-awaited Universes Beyond set *The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth*™.


![The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth™ set logo](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_WaVAD56lND1m.png)



![The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth™ artwork 1](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/llHM3PBL8K.jpg)Art by:  [Dmitry Burmak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Dmitry%20Burmak%22%5D)
We are unabashedly excited for *The Lord of the Rings*, and for the vision of the timeless stories that we've worked so hard to bring to *Magic* in partnership with the people at Middle-earth Enterprises. The look and the feel for the world, the characters, the weapons, the locations, and the story moments are going to be intimately familiar yet fresh and relevant for a wider audience.


The folks at Middle-earth Enterprises take their roles as stewards very seriously, and every decision about characters has been made with deep reverence to the original. With that in mind, together we set out to make a set that follows two guiding principles:


* Diversity: *The Lord of the Rings* is about the different peoples of Middle-earth coming together to fight Sauron, finding strength in their diversity. We want to make this appealing story fresh and relevant to an even wider audience.
* Originality: The goal of this set is to express the story and setting of *The Lord of the Rings* in cards for *Magic: The Gathering*. Countless prior efforts have painted vivid pictures of this world, but our goal is a modern take on the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, lovingly crafted for a new generation of players and fans.

The results are breathtaking. Here is just a sample of the art you'll see when *The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth*™ releases in 2023.



![The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth™ artwork 2](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/4zzp2k8pVa.jpg)Art by:  [Magali Villeneuve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Magali%20Villeneuve%22%5D)
Plus, some of this incredible artwork deserves more than just one card and expands to many more with new borderless scene cards that beautifully capture the story—such as the Battle of Pelennor Fields outside of Gondor.



![The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth™ artwork 3](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/OZnaiZBICP.jpg)Art by:  [Tyler Jacobsen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Tyler%20Jacobsen%22%5D)
*The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth*™ releases worldwide midyear 2023.
