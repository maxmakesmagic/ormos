*Peter Costantinidis*


Here are my observations on the latest changes to the Comprehensive Rules. I produced these using fairly crude file comparison tools to identify what changed and then editing the differences.


There were a lot of changes to the Glossary. About two thirds of this document covers Glossary changes.


Please don't consider this to be in any way "official". I rushed this out just prior to leaving for GP San Diego.


----- ----- ----- ----- -----  

These are rule numbers that did not exist in the April version.  These  

rules don't necessarily change the way the game is played.


103.2  300.6  410.11  

212.2a-d 406.2e  412.3  

217.2d  408.g  412.4  

----- ----- ----- ----- -----


----- ----- ----- ----- -----  

These rule numbers do not exist in the November version.


410.8a  

    Some triggered abilities watch for a game state, such as a  

    player's life total or the number of cards in play, rather than  

    an event. These abilities trigger as soon as the game state  

    matches their condition (even if it's not otherwise legal to  

    play a spell or ability at that time). These are called "state  

    triggers." (Don't confuse state triggers with state-based  

    effects.)  

410.8b  

    State-triggered abilities don't trigger again until the initial  

    condition has resolved or been countered. Then, if the permanent  

    with the ability is still in play and the game state still  

    matches its trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.  

419.8c  

[Redundant with 419.8a.]  

    If multiple replacement effects create a loop, the affected  

    player or the controller of the affected permanent or zone  

    decides where to break the loop.


----- ----- ----- ----- -----


----- ----- ----- ----- -----  

This section contains rules that have changed enough that I found  

something interesting about the change.  Indented text has been quoted  

directly from the rules.


102.2  

Losing because of drawing out is now a state-based effect:  

    When a player is required to draw more cards than are left in  

    his or her library, he or she draws the remaining cards, then  

    loses the game the next time a player receives priority. (This  

    is a state-based effect. See rule 420, "State-Based Effects.")


214.5  

Clarifications about interactions between type-changing abilities and  

continuous effects.  

    The initial value of a permanent's characteristic is the value  

    printed on the card or specified by the spell or ability that  

    create the token or changed the type of the permanent. Using a  

    type-changing ability that says it changes a characteristic  

    changes the initial values of characteristics stated in the  

    ability's text, not the current values. Continuous effects that  

    don't change the type of a permanent affect current values of  

    characteristics and can override characteristics set by  

    type-changing abilities.


    EXAMPLE: A player plays an artifact's ability that reads "2:  

    This permanent is a 3/2 artifact creature." Later in the turn,  

    the artifact creature is affected by an ability that reads  

    "Target creature is 0/2." At this point, playing the ability of  

    the artifact again won't do anything; because the type-changing  

    ability changes characteristics at the initial level, it can't  

    override the effect. The artifact creature remains 0/2.


214.8d  

Used to specify that the "controller" chooses the permanent to enchant,  

now it is the player putting it into play.


215.2  

Added:  

    If a "Legendary" noncreature permanent becomes a creature, it  

    gets the creature type "Legend" for as long as it's a creature.  

    If a creature of type "Legend" becomes a noncreature permanent,  

    it's a "Legendary" permanent of the new type. In other words,  

    they mean the same thing, except that one refers to creatures  

    and the other to noncreatures.


216.1  

Specifies controller and owner of tokens:  

    Some spells and abilities put a token creature into play. The  

    token is controlled by whoever put it into play and owned by the  

    controller of the spell or ability that created it. The rules  

    text of the spell or ability defines the initial characteristics  

    of the token it creates. A token's name is its creature type  

    unless otherwise specified; for example, the creature type of a  

    Goblin token is Goblin. Once a token is in play, changing its  

    name doesn't change its creature type, and vice versa.


217.5d  

Cards outside the in-play zone aren't controlled by anyone.


300.3  

Effects scheduled to last until some phase/step now expire at the  

beginning of that phase/step, instead of the end of the preceding  

phase/step.


303.1  

Specifies that abilities triggering during the untap step go on the stack  

at the beginning of the upkeep step.


308.5, 309.3  

Added "and all <\*> costs have been paid" to the definition of an attacking  

or a blocking creature (<\*> is "attacking" or "blocking").


310.1b-d  

Changed "will deal" to "will assign".


406.1a  

Specifies that mana abilities are activated abilities.


406.1b  

Added:  

    Triggered abilities that put mana into a player's mana pool but  

    trigger from events other than activating mana abilities aren't  

    mana abilities. They go on the stack and resolve like any other  

    triggered ability.  

408.1b  

Added the following about the resolution of state-based effects:  

    Each time a player receives priority, all applicable state-based  

    effects resolve (See rule 420, "State-Based Effects"), then  

    triggered abilities are added to the stack (See rule 410,  

    "Handling Triggered Abilities"); these steps repeat until no  

    further state-based effects or triggered abilities are  

    generated. Then the player may play a spell, ability, or land as  

    governed by the rules for that phase.


409.1e  

Has been generalized to apply to more than just dividing damage.


409.1f  

Costs can be paid in any order.


410.2  

Clarification of "may" in triggered abilities:  

    If the ability says a player "may" do something, that player  

    controls the triggered ability and the pseudospell. If the  

    ability says this for more than one player, it generates one  

    pseudospell per player. If the ability doesn't use the word  

    "may," the controller of the source of the triggered ability  

    controls the ability (and the pseudospell).


410.5  

Rewritten to make much more sense (no longer described as "modal"):  

    Some triggered abilities give a player a choice of completing an  

    action or doing nothing (denoted with the word "may"). This  

    choice is made at the time the ability would be put on the  

    stack. If the player chooses to complete the action, a  

    psuedospell is added to the stack. Otherwise, nothing is added  

    to the stack; the ability is ignored. This doesn't apply to a  

    triggered ability that requires a player to do something  

    "unless" that player pays the alternative requirement.


419.5  

Added:  

    Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can't  

    be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the  

    impossible instruction.


419.6b  

Corrected description of regeneration to be a "destruction-replacement  

effect" instead of a "damage-replacement" effect. Added the following:


    Note that if destruction is caused by lethal damage, any  

    abilities that trigger from that damage being dealt still  

    trigger even if the permanent regenerates.


420.5a  

Added:  

    ...who was required to draw more cards than were in his or her  

    library...


420.5b  

Now effects creatures with less than 0 toughness.


420.5c  

Defines lethal damage.


501.3  

Added (reminder text).


502.3a  

Now specifies when flanking triggers.

Glossy Change (Detailed Descriptions)


This section covers changes to existing Glossary entries. In general, most  

changes involved the addition of a phrase or sentence to the existing  

entry. Where this is the case, the added text is simply listed without any  

comments from me. Sometimes, such as when there are multiple,  

non-contiguous, changes, the entire definition is included.


Some entries reference Appendix B, "Older Rules." These entries are  

mentioned below.


Ability  

    When an effect states that a permanent "gains" or "has" an ability,  

    it's granting that permanent an ability. If an effect defines a  

    characteristic of the permanent ("[permanent] is [characteristic]"),  

    it's not granting an ability.


Active Player  

States that the active player does not get priority at for the begin of  

untap and clean-up steps.


Artifact Creature  

    "Artifact" isn't a creature type. Most artifact creatures have no  

    creature type. Those with a creature type will say "Artifact  

    Creature - [type]"; for example, "Artifact Creature - Golem."


Attack  

    Using a spell or ability (even during the combat phase) is never  

    considered to be an attack.


Banding, Bands with Other (Obsolete)  

References Appendix B, "Older Rules."


    Snow-covered lands are still basic lands, for example, Snow-Covered  

    Plains is considered a plains.


Bury (Obsolete)  

    For most purposes, "bury" is equivalent to "destroy [this  

    permanent]; it can't be regenerated."


Buyback  

New references rule 413.2h.  

    If for some reason the card wouldn't otherwise go to its  

    controller's graveyard, it doesn't go to his or her hand; it goes to  

    wherever it's otherwise destined.


Casting Cost (Obsolete)  

    The obsolete term "total casting cost" means "converted mana cost."


Characteristics  

The word "exclusively" now modifies the list. Added "what it enchants" to  

the list of things that are not characteristics.


Color  

    If an effect gives a permanent a new color, the new color replaces  

    all previous colors rather than adding to them.


Colorless  

    Lands and artifacts are colorless because they have either no mana  

    cost or no colored mana in their mana costs. They can be given a  

    color by effects.


Comes into Play [Improved definition]  

    A permanent comes into play when the card or token representing  

    it is moved into the in-play zone. A permanent whose type or  

    controller changes doesn't "come into play."


 Permanents come into play untapped and under the control of  

whoever put them into play.


 Instructions that alter permanents coming into play do so as  

they come into play. For example, if an instruction causes  

something to come into play tapped, it isn't put into play  

untapped and then tapped. The controller-to-be of that  

permanent makes any choices required by the instruction.


 When a permanent comes into play, first apply any "as [card]  

comes into play" text, then apply any "[card] comes into  

play with" text, then apply continuous effects, then check  

to determine if the current form of the permanent generates  

any triggered abilities.


Converted Mana Cost  

    The old term for converted mana cost was "total casting cost."


Cost  

..., and so on.


Counts As  

    ...may be tapped for green mana and...


Cumulative Upkeep  

    Note that if a card has more than one cumulative upkeep cost, each  

    creates a separate triggered ability at the beginning of upkeep that  

    counts all the cumulative upkeep counters on the card from both  

    abilities.


Cycling  

Deleted the erroneous part about effecting a spell's resolution.


Damage  

Describes damage on noncreature permanents.


Damage-Prevention Ability  

    ...or activated ability...


Discard [Updated]  

    A player discards a card by putting the card from his or her hand  

    into his or her graveyard. By default, spells and abilities that  

    cause a player to discard a card allow the affected player to choose  

    which card to discard. Some spells and abilities, however, allow  

    another player to make the choice for a random discard.


Event  

    The text of triggered abilities and replacement effects defines the  

    event they're looking for; one "happening" may be treated as a  

    single event by one ability and as multiple events by another. For  

    example, if an attacking creature is blocked by two defending  

    creatures, this is one event for a triggered ability that reads  

    "Whenever [name] becomes blocked" but two events for a triggered  

    ability that reads "Whenever [name] becomes blocked by a creature."


Expansion Symbol  

Includes a comprehensive list of expansion symbols.


First Strike  

Mentions that non-first strike creatures deal damage in a separate step.


Flanking  

Changed "that modifies the declare blockers step" to "that modifies the  

declare blockers step."


Hand  

...that haven't been played yet.


If  

    Note that the word "if" has only its normal English meaning anywhere  

    else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an "if" that  

    immediately follows the trigger condition.


Leaves Play  

References Appendix B, "Older Rules" for phasing.


Main Phase  

    ...also called the "precombat" and "postcombat" main phases.


Mana Symbol  

    A spell or ability whose cost is 0 must still be played the same way  

    as one with a cost greater than zero; it won't "play itself  

    automatically."


Move  

A few changes to the second paragraph:  

    A moved enchantment stops enchanting the previous permanent and  

    starts enchanting the new one, and it receives a new timestamp.  

    Nothing else about the enchantment changes. The enchantment never  

    left play, so no comes-into-play or leaves-play triggered abilities  

    will trigger. If an ability of the moved enchantment affecting  

    "enchanted [permanent]" was on the stack when the enchantment moved,  

    it will affect the new enchanted permanent when it resolves, not the  

    old one.


Opponent  

Changed "player playing the spell" to "player controlling the spell".


Pay  

    Any time a player is asked to pay mana, mana abilities may be  

    played.


    Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn't pay another spell  

    or ability's cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same  

    thing as the other cost asks for.


Permanently (Obsolete)  

    ...or it leaves play.


Phased Out (Obsolete)  

References Appendix B, "Older Rules."


Phasing (Obsolete)  

References Appendix B, "Older Rules."


Priority  

    The player who has the option to play a spell or ability at any  

    given time has priority.


 Each time a spell or ability (other than a mana ability)  

resolves, and at the beginning of most phases or steps, the  

active player receives priority. After a player plays a spell,  

ability, or land, he or she again receives priority. When a  

player passes, his or her opponent receives priority. (If both  

players pass in succession the top spell or ability on the stack  

resolves, or if the stack is empty the phase or step ends.)


 Each time a player receives priority, all applicable state-based  

effects resolve (see rule 420, "State-Based Effects") and then  

triggered abilities are added to the stack (see rule 410,  

"Handling Triggered Abilities"); these steps repeat until no  

further state-based effects or triggered abilities are  

generated. Then the player may play a spell, ability, or land as  

governed by the rules for that phase.


Regenerate  

    Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. "Regenerate  

    [permanent]" means "The next time [permanent] would be destroyed  

    this turn, instead remove all damage from it, tap it, and (if it's  

    in combat) remove it from combat." Because it's a replacement  

    effect, it must be active before the attempted destruction event.  

    Note that if destruction is caused by lethal damage, any abilities  

    that trigger from that damage being dealt still trigger even if the  

    permanent regenerates.


Set Aside  

    To set aside a card is to remove it from the game; however, the  

    effect will specify some condition that allows the set-aside card to  

    return to the game. See also Removed from the Game.


Skip  

    ...one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence,  

while  

    the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.


Source  

    The source of an ability or of damage is the card or token that  

    generated it. If an effect requires a player to choose a source, he  

    or she may choose either a permanent or a spell on the stack  

    (including one that creates a permanent) or any card or permanent  

    referred to by a spell or pseudospell on the stack. The effect will  

    apply to the next damage dealt by that spell or by that permanent  

    (in combat or by one of its abilities). A source doesn't need to be  

    capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice.


State-Based Effects  

No longer references the start of a step/phase. This definition is not  

comprehensive, as state-based effects are also checked during the Cleanup  

Step (i.e. when players don't normally receive priority).


Static Ability  

    ...and has the ability.


Target  

    A spell or pseudospell on the stack can't target itself.


Type  

    A land's type is the same as its name.


    A local enchantment's type is printed after the word "Enchant"  

    on the card's type line.


    The "type" of mana includes both its color and any restrictions  

    placed upon it; for example, mana that can be used only to play  

    artifact spells.


Unblockable  

    Spells or abilities may still cause it to become blocked.


Vanguard Card  

    ...however, these abilities have no color, and damage from them  

    isn't damage from a permanent of any type or a source of any color.  

    A Vanguard card isn't a Magic card, so it can't be affected by  

    spells or abilities.
