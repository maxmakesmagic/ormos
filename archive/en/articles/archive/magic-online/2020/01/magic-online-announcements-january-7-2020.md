*Vintage Cube* until January 16
-------------------------------


The *Vintage Cube* is back and will run until January 16! Tabletop Studio's (R&D) Reggie Valk has this to say about the latest update:


*"As December rolls on,* Magic Online *players know what's coming:* Vintage Cube*. If you're unfamiliar,* Vintage Cube *is one of the most powerful cubes you can play, headlined by the Power Nine and other members of the Vintage reserved list. While considering how to update the Cube for this year's December iteration, I decided that this update wasn't going to attempt any major overhauls, just include some of the most powerful cards to be printed this year. Fortunately, there were quite a few!* War of the Spark *brought powerful new planeswalkers that have made a splash even in Vintage, and* Modern Horizons *and* Throne of Eldraine *were no slouches either. Still, the core of the Cube experience remains the same: there's Tinker-fueled artifact decks, Storm combo, and blistering fast mono-red aggro to name a few. Happy cubing! Here's hoping you all get to open a Black Lotus!"*

Change to Banned and Restricted Timing
--------------------------------------


As announced [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/december-16-2019-banned-and-restricted-announcement), future banned and restricted announcements are no longer tied to specific timing windows. All future B&R announcements for all formats will be made on Mondays and are effective on *Magic Online* at noon Pacific Time on the following day. For those of you who have been playing Pioneer, this means that each other format's timing now matches Pioneer's.


While we will no longer ban cards on the Monday of the announcement, the results of a B&R change are the same as they have been: When a card is banned or restricted, players using the newly banned card in a league have until the *Magic Online* effective time to finish their league courses. At that time, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.




---

Limited PTQ Saturday
--------------------


On Saturday, January 11, there will be a Limited PTQ at 7 a.m. PT! The set will be *Throne of Eldraine*, and the event will cost 1 Red Limited PTQ Token. You can also join with 40 of the new year's [MOCS Qualifier Points](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020). The winner qualifies for their choice of events in Series 2 of the [2020 Players Tour](https://magic.gg/players-tour) in May.

Vintage & Pauper Format Championship January 11â€“12
--------------------------------------------------


The final four spots at the *Magic Online* Championship will be awarded to the winners of the upcoming Format Championships! [These players](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/format-championship-invites)â€”top finishers from each of the five Playoffs in Modern, Legacy, Vintage, and Pauperâ€”will compete over the first two weekends in January in 40-player tournaments. In addition to the *Magic Online* Championship invite, Format Champions will also be among the first to qualify for Series 2 of the 2020 Players Tour in May.


We'd like to extend a warm congratulation to the winners of last week's Format Championships, our first two 2019 Format Champions:
