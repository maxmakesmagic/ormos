**How did you chose to come to Moscow for the Grand Prix?**

*Marijn Lybaert: I really want to qualify for the Pro Tour in Hawaii, and the qualifiers in Belgium have more than 220 people, so I like my chances better here. Although I expected close to 1 000 players, so 530 is a nice surprise.*

*Alessandro Portaro: I've never been to Moscow before, and I like playing Grand Prix in general. And the flight from Italy wasn't to expensive, so I decided to spend a week here on vacation.*

*Tomoharu Saito: I'm trying to get Pro Points to reach gold level, and I've never been to Russia. I have a world map where I color the countries I've visited playing **Magic**, and Russia is a big country, so it will look nice on the map.*

*Lee Shi Tian: I booked my flight before the last Pro Tour, so I didn't know where I would be in Pro Points. I have 42 points now, so I'm locked for Platinum for next season, but tree points here would give me Platinum benefits for Pro Tour **Magic** 2015, which would be nice.*

*Patrick Dickmann: To try to get Pro Points for Platinum. I have 36 now, but I have two weak finishes at Grand Prix. And there are only a few left in the season, so I wanted to play as many as possible. Unfortunately I couldn't get anyone from Germany to come with me, so I traveled alone.*
