It has been another busy week for the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings, with thirteen players on the leaderboard in action this past weekend, spread across two continents. At [Grand Prix Hong Kong](/en/events/coverage/nakamura-masters-hong-kong), the format was *Theros* Limited, where three players added to their tally. 

 Since his [Pro Tour victory in Seattle](/en/events/coverage/ptrtr12) last year, Stanislav Cifka has regularly travelled to far-flung destinations, and his trip to Hong Kong resulted in a 26th-place finish. His compatriot Martin Juza fared even better, reaching the finals, which lifted him past both Brian Kibler and David Ochoa into No. 14 in the rankings. Winning the final was Shuhei Nakamura of Japan, claiming his sixth Grand Prix title. He's now within range of the top spot. 

 Over in America, it was Standard at [Grand Prix Louisville](/en/events/coverage/braun-duin-leader-pack-louisville), and four players made headway. Reid Duke took over the No. 3 spot in the rankings from Shahar Shenhar by finishing 10th. Sam Black continued his impressive run with his 5th-place at the GP, while Player of the Year Josh Utter-Leyton narrowly failed to return to No.1 when he finished 42nd in Louisville, meaning Ben Stark retains top spot for another week. 

 Well as the Americans did, it was the *North* part of North America that delivered our lone new entry this week. Canada's Jon Stern now has three Grand Prix Top 8s in less than a calendar year, including victory at [Grand Prix Atlantic City](/en/events/coverage/stern%E2%80%99s-bant-auras-take-atlantic-city) and 2nd place in Louisville. Stern enters at No. 23, and is definitely one to watch. 

 Grand Prix Antwerp is up next, and a chance for No.11 Jeremy Dezani to shine in the Modern format, where he already has a title to his name from [Grand Prix Lyon](/en/events/coverage/jund-jolts-jeremy-top) in 2012. Join us again next week for the latest update in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
