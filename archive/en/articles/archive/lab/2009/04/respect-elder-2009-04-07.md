![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040541im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl33_bolasSoup.jpg)Normally, the first sentence of my column is where I warmly and enthusiastically welcome those who are reading with a giant, "Hi!" or "Hello there!" or "No soup for you! Next!" (Oh wait, that's how I welcome telemarketers, not my readers.) Anyways, the reason I'm being a little hush-hush on the welcoming front today is because if I raise my voice to its normal volume level, I'll probably disturb him.

Assuredly, you guys also know him. Nicol Bolas: Among the last of the old era of planeswalkers, who also happens to have centuries of experience crammed into his astute mind. The one with nearly unlimited amounts of power at his disposal, the one with the oldest and yet coolest library ever, and the very individual who plotted the merging of the five shards of Alara. And his fashion sense? Don't get me started. Nicol Bolas will do for the undone tie what Anton Chigurh did for the bowl cut.

Now that I've somewhat accurately described him, hopefully you'll understand why I'm slightly terrified of the planeswalker. You see, in honor of Nicol Bolas Week (which we're right in the middle of, by the way) each **magicthegathering.com** columnist got a chance to meet Nicol Bolas himself, as a preparatory measure for the theme week. The kicker was that I didn't know when he would show up, so all week I was fretting about the fact that any moment a screamingly diabolical dragon could come crashing through my wall. Finally, last Friday, I had seemingly calmed down enough to get out from under my bed and get some food. Maybe even watch some TV.

I turned the corner, thinking about eating that last slice of cheesecake in my fridge, and there he was. Nicol Bolas. Standing on my crushed television.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20130606064111im_/http://wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl33_bolasCheesecake.jpg)I mustered a soft, "Hi there."

Bolas laughed tyrannically, a sound I won't forget anytime soon. "Make this week good, or ...." he growled, vaporizing my couch to make his point. With that, he raised his wings and flew away, taking care to create a second gaping hole in my ceiling.

Just when I thought it was over, he stuck his monstrous head back through the hole and said, "I ate your cheesecake."
