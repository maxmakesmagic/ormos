Last Blog of the Year
---------------------


This blog post will be the last one until **January 9, 2018**. (Yes, it is actually about to be 2018, and no, we can't believe it either.) All the *Magic Online* information you should need between now and then, including all upcoming premier play events, can be found here. So have a happy New Year, and we'll see you on the other side!




---

Vintage Cube Starts Tomorrow
----------------------------


It's true! Starting tomorrow (December 20), Vintage Cube returns to *Magic Online* for a nice long run. It will be available through January 15, so you've got plenty of time to stay cozy indoors, play, and find your favorite archetypes. Whether or not you've ever played Vintage, this cube is a ton of fun and a great way to try out some of the most powerful and interesting cards from *Magic*'s history.




---

Watch for *Rivals of Ixalan* Prerelease Information
---------------------------------------------------


By the time this blog returns, the *Rivals of Ixalan* MTGO Prerelease will be right around the corner. But don't worry, we wouldn't leave you with your questions unanswered! Keep an eye out here on Wednesday, January 3, for an article all about the *Rivals* Prerelease.




---

Additional *Amonkhet* Redemptions
---------------------------------


Good news for those of you who tried to redeem *Amonkhet* cards after we ran out of stock. We're doing another print run to fulfill redemption orders, which will be available early in 2018. Check back then for another chance to redeem your cards!




---

Two PTQs Coming Up
------------------


Two Pro Tour Qualifiers are coming up before the end of the year: Saturday, December 23, and Sunday, December 31 (both at 7 a.m. PT). The format for both will be *Ixalan* Sealed. Entry into either event requires a Limited Entry Token (earned via a Limited PTQ Preliminary event). If you're aiming for a seat at Pro Tour *Dominaria*, one of these tournaments could be what gets you there.

Four MOCS Events
----------------


The *Magic Online* Championship Series has a lot going on over the next month. Both Saturday, December 30, and Saturday, January 6, bring MOCS Open events, both starting at 7 a.m. PT and both featuring *Ixalan* Sealed. MOCS Open events do not require an invitation or Qualifier Points to joinâ€”simply join this event with 40 Event Tickets or 400 Play Points. The winner qualifies for the *Magic Online* Championship, a Pro Tour, and the Pro Tour Challenge event at that Pro Tour.


There are also two MOCS Monthly events coming up (also both at 7 a.m. PT): Friday, December 29, will feature *Ixalan* Sealed, and Sunday, January 7, will feature Modern. Players can enter either event with 35 Qualifier Points (QPs), and top finishers qualify for Playoff Events in the 2018 series.


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the year. Top players on the [Leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) at the end of the 2018 MOCS will qualify for the year-end Championship event.
