Grand Prix Metz 2017
--------------------


Hugony Dreamstealer in Metz
===========================




Martin Jůza had lost the finals of two Limited GPs during the current block's run already. Finding himself on the receiving end of Dreamstealer, he lost yet again, this time to Francesco Hugony, champion of Grand Prix Metz 2017!

Day 2 Coverage



1,485 players entered this final *Amonkhet* block Limited Grand Prix, most notable among them one Martin Jůza, Hall of Famer. 452 returned for the second day's Booster Draft rounds, including five players at 9-0, most notable among them one Martin Jůza, 2015–16 Draft Master. Eventually, eight players entered the feature match area for one final draft, most notable among them one Martin Jůza, for whom this marked the 27th Top 8 of his career. Finally, two players duked it out for the title and trophy, a position in which one Martin Jůza had found himself twice before during the current block's run in Limited.


You really couldn't make up a story like that; it would be unbelievable. Add to this the fact that Jůza had lost both of his previous finals appearances and did so again this weekend. Furthermore, marvel at the coincidence that Dreamstealer had been instrumental in Jůza's undefeated Day 1 run, whereas it was instrumental in his unmaking in the finals. If you got all this, then you have the story of Grand Prix Metz 2017 in a nutshell.


Now congratulate Francesco Fritto Hugony, who beat Jůza this time to become champion of Grand Prix Metz 2017!

Day 1 Coverage



After nine rounds of *Hour of Devastation*/*Amonkhet* Sealed Deck play, the last at the Grand Prix level, Grand Prix Metz's original field of 1,485 competitors was cut down to just 452. Leading the charge into the second day were Mitchell Manders, Elias Klocker, Cosmin Achim, Martin Jůza, and Francesco Fritto Hugony. But other notable players weren't far behind. In fact, they were hot on their heels, with Gold pros Petr Sochůrek, Pierre Dagen, Peter Vieren, and Alexander Hayne all finishing the day on records of 8-1.


So the stage for Day 2 was set, populated with familiar characters ready to command the magical spells and creatures that players had grown so fond of over the past months—all set to give the beloved Limited format a worthy send-off!
