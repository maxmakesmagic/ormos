As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






It's been a year since the *Lorwyn* Prerelease. I remember the tournament well, though. I opened a card that got me really excited.


![Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirror+Entity)  
Very little explanation is needed for those of you that had the pleasure of playing with [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) in Limited. The card outright wins games. It demanded that your opponent have a removal spell right away. I expected this card to be a runaway Constructed hit. Unfortunately, it never really caught on. I still can't figure out why this card hasn't seen much play. In honor of my favorite Lorwyn rare ... may I humbly present "Mirror Mirror."

### How It Works


Overall, it's a pretty straightforward concept. However, there are a few hidden gems here. You can use [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) to protect the [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) and his minions the turn you play them:


Pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) to activate [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity). All my creatures are now 1/1 Elves. Tap six creatures for six mana and activate [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) again to make all my creatures 6/6.


Each card plays a particular role in the deck's inner workings.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_five1.jpg)  
[Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger): [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger) fetches up our [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) and holds the fort while the deck amasses an army. It's important that we actually draw a [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) or [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane). The harbinger is one of the best ways to do this. 


[Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves): [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) ramp us into our powerful token producers like [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) and [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). Once [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) gets going, any size body becomes an extremely relevant threat.


[Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid): [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) is very important in protecting the [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity). We can make huge amounts of tokens and a [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) and just get our key card burned out. [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) lets us use the "gain all creature types" clause on [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) to protect it from whatever one of our opponent's might play.


[Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid): [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) ramps our mana very quickly. We can play this fine young lady on our second turn and use it to play a [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) on our third. It can also be used to combo with other cards in our deck. We can activate our [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) for an arbitrarily large amount and use our [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) to play whatever our hearts desire.


[Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity): Not much needs to be said for this card. The deck is built around abusing the current lack of [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) effects in the casual room and nothing takes advantage of that more than [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_five2.jpg)  
[Hunting Triad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Triad): Our deck wants to be playing a lot of token production. [Hunting Triad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Triad) doubles as a combat trick.


[Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession): Three fliers for one card. This seems absolutely amazing to me.


[Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger): The best of all the token producers in the deck. [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) is an amazing threat on its own and can become especially absurd when you're combining it with a [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) or [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane).


Activate Ajani, swing with my team, before blockers are declared; tap three tokens give Cloadgoat Ranger +2/+0 and flying.


[Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane): [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) is absurdly powerful. He makes your attacks more potent and makes your opponent's attacks very difficult.


[Crib Swap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crib+Swap): A removal spell for problem cards. You can search for it with your Harbinger.


The deck seemed pretty tight, so I brought it into the casual room to play some games.


### Round 1 vs. Elementals


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_goat.jpg)I mulliganed down to six on the play and kept [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), and [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane). My [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) was the first play of the game. I had drawn into a pair of [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). My opponent played a "comes into play tapped" land on his first two turns. I played my turn-three [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) and passed. My opponent played a [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats). I discarded a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). I played [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) and attacked with the team. I gave my [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) +2/+0 and flying before blockers were declared. On my opponent's turn he played [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) destroying everything but my [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger). I played another [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), used Ajani's -1 ability and got in for 7 in the air with the first Ranger (I used the tokens from the other to give the first flying.) My opponent scooped it up the next turn.


1-0


### Round 2 vs. Red Burn


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_demigod.jpg)I kept [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity), [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and [Hunting Triad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Triad) on the draw. My opponent played a [Ghitu Encampment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Encampment) and I played my Elves. My opponent had a second-turn [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) for my Elves. I played a second land and played the Heritage druid I had drawn. My opponent played a [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang) and attacked for 3. I drew [Crib Swap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crib+Swap), played a land and passed. My opponent attacked me and I played the Swap. My opponent passed. I played [Hunting Triad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Triad), and my opponent played [Flame Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) targeting me. On his turn he played [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge). I went to 8. On my turn I played [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) and Devoted druid. He attacked with the Demigod and I blocked with a token. I played [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) the next turn. He attempted to [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) the Entity but I activated it for 4. On his turn he played another Demigod and attacked with both. I untapped my devoted druid and activated my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity). I tapped six untapped "Elves" and activated the [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) for 6. I blocked both Demigods. The next turn I was able to swing for lethal damage.


2-0


### Round 3 vs. a black deck with [Underworld Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Dreams)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_underworld.jpg)I kept [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), and [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) on the draw. My opponent played a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and passed. I drew a [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), played it, and passed. My opponent played another swamp and [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed my Elves. I played [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) and passed, and my opponent played a turn-three [Underworld Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Dreams). I untapped, drew Crib [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), and played [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger). On his turn he played another [Underworld Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Dreams). I played [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) and attacked with my team, making everything a 2/2. On his turn he untapped and played a [Cruel Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Edict), then another. I sacrificed two tokens. On my next turn I activated my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) for 5 and attacked to end the game.


3-0


### Round 4 vs. White Control


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_command.jpg)I mulliganed on the play and kept [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), and [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). My opponent and I played [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) back and forth at each other until I played a third and played [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). On his turn he played a [Story Circle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle). I ripped like a champ and drew [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane) to attack for 6. He played another [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and passed. Wary of [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), I attacked for 6 (which he prevented) and gained 2 life with Ajani. I continued to attack and keep my opponent tapped out preventing the damage until I had amassed a pair of [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger)s in my hand. I played a [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) and gave my team some counters, and my opponent once again prevented the damage from the tokens. On his turn he played [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). On my turn I played another [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) and a [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) and gave my team some counters. My opponent untapped, played a land, and passed. I gave my team some more counters and attacked, and my opponent prevented most of the damage. On his next turn he played an [Austere Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Austere+Command) to destroy all creatures. He slowly used his [Story Circle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle) to prevent me from doing anything. Eventually he played a [Twilight Shepherd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Shepherd) and attacked me until I died.


3-1


### Round 5 vs. Red Creatures


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_gouger.jpg)I mulliganed on the play and kept [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger), [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), and [Hunting Triad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Triad). I played the Harbinger and fetched my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity). My opponent played a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and a [Goblin Mountaineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Mountaineer). I untapped, drew another [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), played another land, and passed. He played [Mudbrawler Cohort](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mudbrawler+Cohort) and attacked with both creatures. I blocked the 2/2. I drew a [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) and played it. He attacked with both again, and I blocked both. He tapped out for [Ashenmoor Gouger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger). I untapped, drew a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and played [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). He attacked with everything again, and I blocked all except the Gouger. I drew [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) and played it. On his turn he attacked with just the [Ashenmoor Gouger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashenmoor+Gouger). I took the 4, then he played another Gouger. On my turn I drew a [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid), played the [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) and the Druid, and attacked for some damage in the air. He attacked with both Gougers, and I blocked one with my Harbinger. He played [Spiteful Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiteful+Visions). On my turn I drew a land and Ajani and played them both, gave my team some counters, and attacked with everyone. After blocks, I activated my mirror entity for 1 and then used all my creatures to make more mana with [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid). All my guys ended up being 8/8s, and I won that turn.


4-1


### Round 6 vs. Mono-Blue Control


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_harbinger.jpg)I was on the play, and I kept [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), [Hunting Triad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Triad), [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger), and [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane). I played my Harbinger on turn one and got my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity). My opponent played an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed. I drew a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and played my [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), and my opponent played another [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed. I played [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), and it resolved. He played another [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). I drew [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), attacked for 3, and attempted to play the Ranger, but my opponent had [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul). He played another [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). I drew another Ranger, attacked for 3, and my second Ranger met another [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul). He played another [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed again. I attacked with my team, and he flashed in a [Faerie Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Harbinger) searching up [Faerie Trickery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Trickery). After blocks, I used my [Hunting Triad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Triad) to pump the token. I then used the Druid and my leftover [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) to play my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity). He drew, played an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and passed. I attacked with everyone and used [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) to make some nice pumps, and he conceded.


5-1


### Round 7 vs. Red-Green Aggro


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_epic.jpg)On the draw, I kept [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid), Trefolk Harbinger, [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger). My opponent played [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) on turn one, and I mirrored the play. On turn two he played [Troll Ascetic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) and passed. I played my Harbinger, getting another [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity), and played my Druid. My opponent played a [Blanchwood Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blanchwood+Armor) on his Troll (with two [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s in play), attacked me for 5, and passed. I drew and played my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity). On his turn he played another [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)d my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity), and attacked for 6. On my turn I played another [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity). He played a [Puncture Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puncture+Blast) this time and attacked again. I drew the land I needed and played a [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger). He attacked with the Troll, and I chump-blocked it with the Harbinger. I drew [Hunting Triad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Triad) and attacked with everyone but two tokens. (That's enough to survive one burn spell. If he has two burn spells I'm dead anyway.) I used the Triad to pump my Ranger and put my opponent on a two-turn clock. He played a sixth land and attacked. I tried to chump-block with a token, but he had [Epic Proportions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epic+Proportions) for the win.


5-2


### Round 8 vs. White Weenie


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab23_day.jpg)I was on the play, and I kept [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger), [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). I played my Elves on the first turn, and my opponent played [Goldmeadow Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Harrier). I played [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger), fetching my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity), on turn two. He played a [Wizened Cenn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizened+Cenn). I played [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) on turn three, and he played [Kithkin Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Harbinger) fetching up another [Wizened Cenn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizened+Cenn). I played Ajani and gave my team some counters before sending in the flyers. On his turn he played the Cenn and attacked with the Harbinger. I blocked it with my Harbinger, and everyone lived. On my turn I played another land and played the [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity), gave my team more counters, and attacked with the flyers again. He untapped and played his own Ajani, killing both of them. I untapped, activated my [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) for a lot, and attacked, but he stopped me with [Holy Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Day) and attacked back On my next turn I activated and attacked for just enough to kill him, and met another [Holy Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Day). Things went on like this until he had played all four [Holy Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Day). Eventually he didn't have a [Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), and I won the game.


6-2


I haven't put together a sideboard yet, but I'm sure it would include [Burrenton Forge-Tender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender). Adding a Gilt-leaf Archdruid or two would allow you to use [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) to steal all your opponents lands.

The Prerelease is this weekend, and I hope all of you are looking forward to it as much as I am. I'll be playing at the Champion Challenge at the big Prerelease in Philadelphia, so you should come by and play a match with me if you get the chance.


Happy brewing, and remember to find your pet card from *Conflux*! (See [last week's article](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/taken-hand-2009-01-22).)
