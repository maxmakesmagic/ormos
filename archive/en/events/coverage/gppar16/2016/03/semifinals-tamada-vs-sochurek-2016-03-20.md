In this match, Japan's Ryoichi Tamada met Petr Sochůrek of the Czech Republic. Both were no stranger to the feature match area, with one previous Grand Prix Top 8 apiece and a finals appearance at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* for Tamada.


Tamada had brought a green-white-blue aggrocontrol deck based on [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), while Sochůrek was playing a control deck with all the best cards in blue, black, and red.


The Games
=========


Tamada kept an opening hand of two lands, [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector), [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner), and three copies of [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company). Sochůrek got to see what was coming thanks to [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind), but quickly realized that exiling one [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) wouldn't make all that much of a difference here.

So Sochůrek devised a different plan. He took [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner) instead and soon began to pressure Tamada with an early [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). The Vampire Warrior did a lot: deal damage, gain life, make sure a [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) would never come back from the grave, spit out a Zombie. Eventually, it was returned to Sochůrek's hand via [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage), then it lost a fight with [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) under [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command). But the damage was done.


A [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) which only came up with a single [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) on an at the time empty board and a second Kalitas sealed Tamada's fate.

Despite playing first in the second game, Tamada was only able to cast his [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) second. Also, whereas he had had tapped lands and lost his Jace before long, Sochůrek had sacrificed fetch lands and was able to transform his own well on time.

*Petr Sochůrek*


Sochůrek had the Jace advantage on his side, but Tamada, through careful timing of various [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance)s and [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke)s managed to keep Sochůrek's threats at bay. Tamada wasn't really able to muster much of an offense, though, especially when [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) was forced past his counter with [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel).


But, just when I was wondering whether sideboarding all of these [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke)s might have forced Tamada to take out some copies of [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), the deck's namesake card finally made its first appearance, found a pair of [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate)s, and the tide began to shift. Attacks with [Lumbering Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumbering+Falls) killed off both [Jace, Telepath Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound) as well as [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller), and suddenly Tamada and Sochůrek were back on equal footing. Meaning: both had but one card left in hand and only lands on the battlefield.


The assembled crowd held its collective breath.


Sochůrek cast [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Tamada cast his fourth [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke). Sochůrek drew and revealed another [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), eliciting a chuckle from Tamada. Dig led to another Chandra and Chandra ended the game in short order.


**Ryoichi Tamada 0-2 Petr Sochůrek**
