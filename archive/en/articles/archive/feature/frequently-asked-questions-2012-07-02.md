An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice).

This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.

The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.

The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**Returning Keyword: Exalted**

Exalted is an ability that makes a creature even more fearsome if it's brave enough to attack alone. It originally appeared in the *Shards of Alara* set.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m13/j5nleuzl49_en.jpg)Duskmantle Prowler   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)  
>  Creature -- Vampire Rogue   
>  2/2   
>  Haste (This creature can attack and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) as soon as it comes under your control.)   
>  Exalted (Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, that creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)

The official rules for exalted are as follows:


> 
> 702.81. Exalted
> 
> 
> 702.81a Exalted is a triggered ability. "Exalted" means "Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, that creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn."
> 
> 
> 702.81b A creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker in a given combat phase. See rule 506.5.
> 
> 
> 

* If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger. The bonuses are given to the attacking creature, not to the permanent with exalted. Ultimately, the attacking creature will wind up with +1/+1 for each of your exalted abilities.
* You must attack with exactly one creature in order for exalted abilities to trigger. Exalted abilities won't trigger if you attack a player with one creature and a planeswalker with another, for example.
* Some cards with exalted abilities have other abilities that also trigger when a creature you control attacks alone. Each time a creature you control attacks alone, both the exalted ability and the other ability will trigger.
* If you attack with multiple creatures, but then all but one are removed from combat, your exalted abilities won't trigger.
* Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
* Exalted abilities resolve before blockers are declared.
* Exalted bonuses last until end of turn. If an effect creates an additional combat phase during your turn, a creature that attacked alone during the first combat phase will still have its exalted bonuses in that new phase. If a creature attacks alone during the second combat phase, all your exalted abilities will trigger again.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.

**Cycle: "The Rings of Shandalar"**

The ***Magic** 2013* core set has a cycle of Equipment that, in addition to giving the equipped creature another bonus, puts a +1/+1 counter on the equipped creature on each of your turns if it's a specific color. Each is named for a particular kingdom, country, or location on the plane of Shandalar.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m13/t39kbligey_en.jpg)Ring of Thune   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)  
>  Artifact -- Equipment   
>  Equipped creature has vigilance. (Attacking doesn't cause it to tap.)   
>  At the beginning of your upkeep, put a +1/+1 counter on equipped creature if it's white.   
>  Equip ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif): Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)

* The first bonus (in Ring of Thune's case, vigilance) is given to the equipped creature no matter what color it is.
* The ability that may put a +1/+1 counter on the equipped creature triggers even if the equipped creature isn't the specified color (or if it isn't equipped to a creature). You can respond to this ability with a spell or ability that changes the equipped creature's color to get the +1/+1 counter.
* An equipped multicolored creature will get the +1/+1 counter if one of its colors is the specified color.

**Theme: Basic Land Types**

Several cards in the ***Magic** 2013* core set care about one or more of the five basic land types: Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. The set also has a cycle of nonbasic lands that produce two colors of mana and that enter the battlefield tapped unless you control a land of a certain type.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m13/7tkmwwim7f_en.jpg)Crimson Muckwader   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  
>  Creature -- Lizard   
>  2/1   
>  Crimson Muckwader gets +1/+1 as long as you control a Swamp.   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif): Regenerate Crimson Muckwader. (The next time this creature would be destroyed this turn, it isn't. Instead tap it, remove all damage from it, and remove it from combat.)


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m13/fhwsmjtc5o_en.jpg)Dragonskull Summit   
>  Land   
>  Dragonskull Summit enters the battlefield tapped unless you control a Swamp or a Mountain.   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) to your mana pool.

* Effects that care about a basic land type are looking for lands that have that land type, not just lands with that name. For example, islandwalk cares if the defending player controls a land with the land type Island, not just lands named Island. (The ***Magic** 2013* core set doesn't have any nonbasic lands with basic land types, but some other sets do.)
* The ***Magic** 2013* "dual lands" check for lands you control with either of the two listed land types, not either of the two listed names. The lands they check for don't have to be basic lands. For example, if you control Stomping Ground (a nonbasic land with the land types Mountain and Forest), Dragonskull Summit will enter the battlefield untapped.
* These dual lands don't have any land types themselves. For example, Dragonskull Summit isn't a Swamp and controlling one won't cause Crimson Muckwader to get +1/+1.
* As these lands are entering the battlefield, they check for lands that are already on the battlefield. They won't see lands that are entering the battlefield at the same time (due to Primeval Titan's ability, for example).

**Returning Card Type: Planeswalker**

A planeswalker is a powerful ally that fights by your side. The rules for the planeswalker card type haven't changed with this release.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m13/wjc2cxzycr_en.jpg)Jace, Memory Adept   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
>  Planeswalker -- Jace   
>  4   
>  [+1]: Draw a card. Target player puts the top card of his or her library into his or her graveyard.   
>  [0]: Target player puts the top ten cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard.   
>  [-7]: Any number of target players each draw twenty cards.

* Planeswalkers are permanents. You can cast one at the time you could cast a sorcery. When your planeswalker spell resolves, it enters the battlefield under your control.
* Planeswalkers are not creatures. Spells and abilities that affect creatures won't affect them.
* If two or more planeswalkers that share a subtype (such as "Jace") are on the battlefield, they're all put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action.
* Planeswalkers have loyalty. A planeswalker enters the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to the number printed in its lower right corner. Activating one of its abilities may cause it to gain or lose loyalty counters. Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from it. If it has no loyalty counters on it, it's put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
* Planeswalkers each have a number of activated abilities called "loyalty abilities." You can activate a loyalty ability of a planeswalker you control only at the time you could cast a sorcery and only if you haven't activated one of that planeswalker's loyalty abilities yet that turn.
* The cost to activate a planeswalker's loyalty ability is represented by a symbol with a number inside. Up-arrows contain positive numbers, such as "+1"; this means "Put one loyalty counter on this planeswalker." Down-arrows contain negative numbers, such as "-7"; this means "Remove seven loyalty counters from this planeswalker." A symbol with a "0" means "Put zero loyalty counters on this planeswalker."
* Activating a loyalty ability with a cost of 0 will leave the number of loyalty counters on that planeswalker unchanged.
* You can't activate a planeswalker's ability with a negative loyalty cost unless the planeswalker has at least that many loyalty counters on it.
* Planeswalkers can't attack (unless an effect turns the planeswalker into a creature). However, they can be attacked. Each of your attacking creatures can attack your opponent or a planeswalker that player controls. You say which as you declare attackers.
* If your planeswalkers are being attacked, you can block the attackers as normal.
* If a creature that's attacking a planeswalker isn't blocked, it'll deal its combat damage to that planeswalker. Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from it.
* If a source you control would deal noncombat damage to an opponent, you may have that source deal that damage to a planeswalker that opponent controls instead. For example, although you can't target a planeswalker with Searing Spear, you can target your opponent with Searing Spear, and then as Searing Spear resolves, choose to have Searing Spear deal its 3 damage to one of your opponent's planeswalkers. (You can't split up that damage between different players and/or planeswalkers.) If you have Searing Spear deal its damage to a planeswalker, three loyalty counters are removed from it.

>  [-3]: Target creature gains flying and double strike until end of turn.   
>  [-8]: Put X 2/2 white Cat creature tokens onto the battlefield, where X is your life total.

* You can activate the first ability without a target. You'll still put one loyalty counter on Ajani when you activate the ability.
* The number of Cat tokens you put onto the battlefield is equal to your life total when the third ability resolves.

* Multiple instances of lifelink aren't cumulative. Activating Arctic Aven's ability more than once during a single turn won't cause you to gain more life.

* You don't reveal the other two cards, nor do you reveal their order on the bottom of the library.
* If there are fewer that three cards in your library when Augur of Bolas's ability resolves, you'll look at the remaining cards. This won't cause you to lose the game as you haven't drawn from an empty library.

>  At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 200 or more cards in your library, you win the game.

* Battle of Wits has an "intervening 'if' clause." This means that if you don't have 200 or more cards in your library at the beginning of your upkeep, the ability won't trigger. If the ability does trigger, but you have fewer than 200 cards in your library when the ability resolves, the ability will do nothing.
* In tournaments, you must be able to shuffle your entire deck within a reasonable amount of time.

* If you sacrifice an attacking or blocking creature during the declare blockers step, it won't deal combat damage. If you wait until the combat damage step, but the creature you wish to sacrifice is dealt lethal damage, it'll be destroyed before you get a chance to sacrifice it.

>  Planeswalker -- Chandra   
>  3   
>  [+1]: Chandra, the Firebrand deals 1 damage to target creature or player.   
>  [-2]: When you cast your next instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.   
>  [-6]: Chandra, the Firebrand deals 6 damage to each of up to six target creatures and/or players.

* Chandra's second ability creates a delayed triggered ability that will copy the next instant or sorcery spell you cast that turn, regardless of whether that spell has targets.
* When the delayed triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of the spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell Chandra copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one --" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell Chandra copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Magmaquake), the copy has the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling after activating Chandra's second ability, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage.
* When you activate Chandra's last ability, you choose up to six target creatures and/or players. No damage is divided, and Chandra can't deal more than 6 damage to any one target. Chandra deals 6 damage to each target that is still legal when the ability resolves.

>  You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.

* Clone's ability doesn't target the chosen creature.
* Clone copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the chosen creature has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost (such as Primordial Hydra), X is 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Clone), then Clone enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Clone copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Clone is not a token, even when copying one.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Clone enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Clone somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Clone can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Clone enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.

* After the first ability resolves, the creature attacks only if it's able to do so as the declare attackers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having the creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't attack in that case either.
* The controller of the creature targeted by the first ability chooses which player or planeswalker that creature attacks.
* After the second ability resolves, the creature blocks only if it's able to do so as the declare blockers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, or no creatures are attacking that player or a planeswalker controlled by that player, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't block in that case either.
* The controller of the creature targeted by the second ability chooses which attacking creature that creature blocks.
* If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, the creature must attack or block only in the first one in which it's able to.

>  When Elderscale Wurm enters the battlefield, if your life total is less than 7, your life total becomes 7. As long as you have 7 or more life, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 7 reduces it to 7 instead.

* Elderscale Wurm's last ability doesn't prevent damage. It only changes the result of damage dealt to you. For example, a creature with lifelink that deals damage to you will still cause its controller to gain life, even if that damage would reduce your life total to less than 7.
* Elderscale Wurm's last ability doesn't affect the loss or payment of life.
* If you have less than 7 life, damage dealt to you reduces your life total as normal.
* If damage is dealt to you and Elderscale Wurm at the same time, and that damage is enough to destroy Elderscale Wurm and reduce your life total to 7 or less, Elderscale Wurm's ability will still apply. For example, if you have 10 life and a spell deals 10 damage to you and 10 damage to Elderscale Wurm, you'll end up at 7 life and Elderscale Wurm will be destroyed.
* In a Commander game, combat damage you're dealt by a commander is still tracked, even if it doesn't change your life total.

Shuffle Elixir of Immortality and your graveyard into their owner's library.

* Activating Elixir of Immortality's ability doesn't cause it to immediately leave the battlefield. If you can untap it, you can activate its ability again in response.
* As the ability resolves, you'll shuffle Elixir of Immortality into its owner's library from the battlefield if it's still there.
* If you gain control of another player's Elixir of Immortality and activate it, the Elixir of Immortality will be shuffled into its owner's library and the cards in your graveyard will be shuffled into your library. You are considered to have shuffled each affected library (even if, as a shortcut, each player physically shuffles his or her own library).
* If Elixir of Immortality is in your graveyard at the time the ability resolves, you'll still wind up shuffling it into your library because you shuffle your entire graveyard into your library. If it's anywhere else by that time, including in another player's graveyard (because that player owns it but you controlled it), it remains where it is and you shuffle just your graveyard into your library.

* Permanent cards that were put into your graveyard from anywhere else, such as a card that was discarded, stay in the graveyard. Permanent cards that you gained control of and went to another player's graveyard from the battlefield will likewise stay in the graveyard.
* You choose what an Aura card put onto the battlefield this way will enchant. You can't choose any permanent cards entering the battlefield at the same time as that Aura. If there's nothing legal for the Aura to enchant, it stays in the graveyard.
* Permanent spells that were countered earlier in the turn never entered the battlefield, so they won't return to the battlefield because of Faith's Reward.

(In other words, as you put the spell on the stack, you choose whether to have it deal 3 damage to a single target, 2 damage to one target and 1 damage to another target, or 1 damage to each of three targets.)
* You can't deal damage to both a player and a planeswalker controlled by that player with Flames of the Firebrand. (See also "Returning Card Type: Planeswalker" in the General Notes section above.)

* Any player can respond to Mindclaw Shaman's triggered ability. However, once that ability starts resolving and the target opponent reveals his or her hand, players can't respond until after the ability finishes resolving. For example, the opponent can't cast the instant or sorcery card you choose to cast in order to stop you from casting it.
* You cast the card from the opponent's hand immediately. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
* The card goes to its owner's graveyard after it resolves (or otherwise leaves the stack), not yours.
* If you can't cast any instant or sorcery card (perhaps because there are no legal targets available) or if you choose not to cast one, then Mindclaw Shaman's ability finishes resolving and the game moves on.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.

* Although Mogg Flunkies can't attack alone, the other attacking creature(s) doesn't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Mogg Flunkies could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game (or in another format using the shared team turns option), Mogg Flunkies can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.

* The control-change effect has no duration. It will last until the affected creature leaves the battlefield or another player gains control of it.
* If the damage from Nicol Bolas's third ability is prevented or redirected, the rest of the effect will still happen. Specifically, the number of cards discarded and permanents sacrificed isn't tied to the amount of damage dealt.
* For the third ability, if the player is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, the ability is countered and none of its effects will happen. No damage will be dealt, no cards will be discarded, and no permanents will be sacrificed.

* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* If Oblivion Ring leaves the battlefield before the first ability has resolved, the second ability will trigger and resolve while the first ability is still on the stack. The second ability won't do anything because there isn't an "exiled card" yet. Then, when the first ability resolves, it will exile the nonland permanent. Oblivion Ring has already left the battlefield at this point, so the nonland permanent card will have no way to return.
* If the exiled card is an Aura, that card's owner chooses what it will enchant as it comes back onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything, but the Aura's enchant ability defines what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains exiled.

>  Phylactery Lich is indestructible.   
>  When you control no permanents with phylactery counters on them, sacrifice Phylactery Lich.

* Lethal damage, damage from a source with deathtouch, and effects that say "destroy" won't cause an indestructible creature to be put into the graveyard. However, an indestructible creature can be put into the graveyard for a number of reasons. The most likely reasons Phylactery Lich would be put into a graveyard are if it's sacrificed (perhaps due to its last ability), or if its toughness is 0 or less.
* Phylactery Lich's first ability doesn't target the artifact.
* If you control no artifacts as Phylactery Lich enters the battlefield, its first ability won't do anything. As soon as it enters the battlefield, its last ability will trigger (unless you control some other permanent with a phylactery counter on it) and you'll have to sacrifice it.
* If Phylactery Lich and an artifact are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, you can't put a phylactery counter on that artifact. You must choose an artifact you control that's already on the battlefield.
* Phylactery Lich's last ability is a "state trigger." Once a state trigger triggers, it won't trigger again as long as the ability is on the stack. If the ability is countered and the trigger condition is still true, it will immediately trigger again.
* Phylactery Lich's last ability checks whether you control any permanents with phylactery counters on them, not whether you control any artifacts with phylactery counters on them. If an artifact with a phylactery counter on it somehow ceases to be an artifact, Phylactery Lich doesn't care.
* Phylactery Lich's last ability checks your permanents for any phylactery counters, not just the specific one that it caused you to put on an artifact. For example, say you put a phylactery counter on a Staff of Nin as Phylactery Lich enters the battlefield. Then you put a phylactery counter on a Jayemdae Tome as another Phylactery Lich enters the battlefield. Then Jayemdae Tome is destroyed. Since you still control the Staff of Nin, the last ability of neither Phylactery Lich triggers.
* The game continually checks whether you control a permanent with a phylactery counter on it. The moment you don't, Phylactery Lich's last ability triggers. The ability doesn't check again, so you'll have to sacrifice Phylactery Lich when it resolves even if you wind up controlling a permanent with a phylactery counter on it by then.

* On the other hand, each creature your opponents control blocks if able, even if that creature wasn't on the battlefield or wasn't controlled by an opponent when Predatory Rampage resolved.
* Predatory Rampage doesn't force any creature to attack.
* Each creature controlled by an opponent blocks only if it's able to do so as the declare blockers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, or no creatures are attacking that player or a planeswalker controlled by that player, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't block in that case either.
* Your opponent still chooses which attacking creature each creature he or she controls blocks.
* If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, each affected creature must block only in the first one in which it's able to.

If there's a cost associated with having it attack, you're not forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't attack in that case either.

* You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the targeted spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one --" or the like), you can't choose a different mode.
* If you cast Redirect targeting a spell that targets a spell on the stack (like Negate does, for example), you can't change that spell's target to itself. You can, however, change that spell's target to Redirect. If you do, that spell will be countered when it tries to resolve because Redirect will have left the stack by then.
* Redirect can target any spell, not just an instant or sorcery spell. For example, you could use it to change the target of an Aura spell. However, if the targeted spell has no targets (for example, if it's an instant or sorcery spell that doesn't specifically use the word "target," or if it's a creature spell), Redirect won't have any effect on it.

* If multiple effects modify your hand size, apply them in timestamp order. For example, if you put Null Profusion (an enchantment that says your maximum hand size is two) onto the battlefield and then put Reliquary Tower onto the battlefield, you'll have no maximum hand size. However, if those permanents enter the battlefield in the opposite order, your maximum hand size would be two.

>  Instant   
>  Copy target instant or sorcery spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.

* Reverberate can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
* When Reverberate resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. The copy resolves before the original spell.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell Reverberate copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one --" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell Reverberate copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Magmaquake does), the copy has the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it with Reverberate, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
* If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.

>  Instant   
>  Counter target spell. Untap up to four lands.

* Rewind targets only a spell. It doesn't target any lands. The lands are chosen on resolution. It doesn't matter who controls the lands.
* When Rewind resolves, you choose up to four lands and those lands untap once. You can't choose one land and have it untap four times, for example.
* If the spell is an illegal target when Rewind tries to resolve, perhaps because it was countered by another spell or ability, Rewind will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't untap any lands.
* If Rewind resolves but the target spell can't be countered, you'll still untap lands.

* If an effect sets your life total to a specific number, and that number is higher than your current life total, the effect will cause you to gain life equal to the difference. Rhox Faithmender will then double that number. For example, if you have 3 life and an effect says that your life total "becomes 10," your life total will actually become 17.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, only Rhox Faithmender's controller is affected by it. If that player's teammate gains life, Rhox Faithmender will have no effect, even when that life gain is applied to the shared team life total.

* The cards you're searching for must be found and exiled if they're in the graveyard because it's a public zone. Finding those cards in the hand and library is optional, because those zones are hidden (even if the hand is temporarily revealed).

* These actions are performed in order, but no triggered abilities resolve in between them and no player may cast spells or activate abilities in between them. This means that if a permanent's ability triggers on a player losing life, that permanent will be exiled first and won't be on the battlefield when your life total becomes 1. Leaves-the-battlefield triggers won't resolve until you're done resolving Worldfire entirely.
* If your life total is greater than 1 when Worldfire resolves, the change in life total will count as life loss. Other effects that interact with life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
* Worldfire won't be exiled. It will go to your graveyard as the final part of its resolution.
