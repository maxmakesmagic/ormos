Standard as we know it held its last big hurrah last weekend, as the third and final round of 2014 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers took place. In all, 72 countries held these events, securing slots for that many players to represent their countries in Nice, France, this December. We offer you one last look at the Standard format going into the new world with a collection of five Top 8 decklists from last weekend's WMCQs.


In addition to that, the Qualifier season continues for Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*. The format last weekend was *Magic 2015* Sealed Deck with a Top 8 Booster Draft, but after this and next weekend's hiatus courtesy of Prereleases and release weekend, the format will change over to *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck with a Booster Draft Top 8. If you want to test your skills with the brand-new set, [learn more about the current PTQ season](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-fate-reforged-qualifiers) and find one near you, and perhaps in February we will see you at the Pro Tour!


And if you're looking to get a jumpstart on your *Khans of Tarkir* Limited knowledge, you can review some Prerelease pools in action by watching our coverage of Sunday from the [2014 *Magic Online* Community Cup](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rP64NRtmbgvYGjvQCUyd6tfelpPTrgT)!
