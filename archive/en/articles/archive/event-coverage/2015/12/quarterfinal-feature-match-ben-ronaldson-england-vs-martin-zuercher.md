![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPFLO00/185.jpg)Ben Ronaldson is the reigning English Champion, and has had impressive performances of late, 17th at Euros, 27th at Worlds and 9th at Pro Tour New York. His opponent was Martin Z¨rcher, a rather unknown Swiss player. Z¨rcher did finish 12th at Grand Prix Milan though.



**Game 1**


Ben won the dice roll, and went first, laying a Badlands and passing. Martin played an Underground sea and passed back. Ben played Swamp, and said go, and Martin Vampiriced in end step. He played an Underground Sea and tried to cast Necro, but Ben had the Force of Will. On Ben's turn he played Swamp, Necro and drew 13 cards, none of which were an Illusions. Martin passed his turn without action, and on Ben's turn he cast the Illusions and Necroed for 15, leaving him at 7, he then tutored to see what he had in his hand prior to his discard step, and Necroed for a further 2 so he could draw the final Force of Will. Marten had nothing to do on his turn and received the Illusions next turn, and it was immediately Pyroblasted for the kill.



**Game 2**


Martin went first in game 2, and started with a Badlands, Duress. Ben revealed a Consult, Necro, Duress and Brainstorm. He took the Consultation and passed the turn. Ben Duressed back on the next turn, and Marten revealed, Annul, Annul, Illusions, Negator. Ben took the Annul and passed back. Martin played a swamp and said Go. Ben played an Underground sea and Brainstormed before passing the turn. Martin played a Badlands and tried to cast Negator, but Ben consulted for an Annul in response, and pulled it as the 7th card. He forced the Negator, and the turn passed back to Ben. Ben played his Mox Diamond and Necro which resolved, before drawing 10 cards. Martin cast a 2nd Negator which resolved, and in Ben's turn he matched the creature with one of his own before drawing a further 4 cards, putting him at a dangerously low 5 life. Martin Duressed on the next turn, and took Ben's Force of Will, but had nothing else to cast. Ben attacked and played a 2nd Negator. Martin passed the turn, and Ben continued to beat before Necroing for 1 looking for a way to preserve his position. This left Ben at 4 life, and in his Turn Martin consulted for Firestorm and punched the table when it resolved.



**Game 3**


Martin's opening hand was Necro x 2, Negator x 2 and 3 Land. Ben had a very controlly hand, and it didn't look like many of Martin's spells were going to resolve until he topdecked 2 Duress, casting them on turns 1 and 2 taking a Necro and a Consult. Ben was terribly unlucky, since these were the only 2 cards that Martin could draw that would make the difference. Martin resolved a Necro and 2 Negators in the following 3 turns and beat Ben to death.



**Final Result:** Martin Z¨rcher 2 - 1 Ben Ronaldson
