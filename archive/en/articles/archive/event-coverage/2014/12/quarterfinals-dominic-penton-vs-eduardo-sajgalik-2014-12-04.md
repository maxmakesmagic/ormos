Quarterfinals - Dominic Penton vs Eduardo Sajgalik
==================================================



 Posted in **Event Coverage**
 on December 4, 2014 










He's only 16, but Dominic Penton has quietly been amassing an absurdly good Nationals record. In his third event, his Limited record is 6-0, 6-0, 5-1. For those that can't count, that's 17-1. The top 8, however, is Constructed, and it's mono-red that Dominic will need to fuel the fire of his Worlds ambitions. Across the table sits Eduardo Sajgalik, a man who has already played at Worlds, as a member of the Canadian National Team! Sajgalik also has a top 8 from Great Britain Nationals, making him arguably the favorite coming into the top 8 - although Grand Prix London Champion Daniel Royde might have something to say about that.


### Game One


Sajgalik got us under way with [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), a nice start against a mulligan to six and no turn one play from Penton. Or turn two, for that matter. A second [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) followed, and it was all Sajgalik in the early running. [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) was Penton's first play, but that isn't what you want on turn three. When Sajgalik cast his third [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), we understood just how pernicious the card advantage is, Penton using [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to deal with just one Hawk, at the price of an entire card. Penton added a second [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), and then [Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix), which met [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) with kicker.

Life totals - Caw-Blade: 20. Mono-red: 13. Yeah, really.


Sajgalik cast [Emeria Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel), and followed it with the perfect land, [Scald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scald)ing Tarn, netting him a free 1/1 with the promise of another.


[Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) was replayed, but this was all one way traffic. When Penton attempted to combine his Phoenix with a [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) activation, Sajgalik was ready with [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) with kicker to save his [Emeria Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel). [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) found [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) waiting, and the torture was soon over for Penton, who had been given as comprehensive a beating as it was possible to imagine in the opening game of the top 8.

### Game Two


There was a substantial delay before the start of game two, with multiple mulligans. Penton stuck at six, while Sajgalik went all the way to four. [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) opened for Penton, not the [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) which might have brought Sajgalik back into the game. Still, he managed three lands and Timely [Reinforcements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reinforcements), forcing Penton to [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) himself in repsonse. [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) dealt with the Reinforcement soldiers, and the [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) put Sajgalik to 17.


After [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), Sajgalik had [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), which met with four life and [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) from Penton.

[Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace) was next for the red mage, which equipped the Lavamancer, which then attacked. Sajgalik, off a mulligan to four remember, laid a sixth land, slammed it down, cast [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan), returned [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and cast [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) next turn. Ridiculous. Fast forward two turns, Sajgalik added [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) to the board, forcing Penton's team to attack the Planeswalker. That team was now the [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), plus [Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix). Eduardo was down to 7, with Dominic at 13. The Phoenix duly died at the hands/wings of [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx), Sajgalik activated Gideon as a 6/6, and he had completed a remarkable escape act, and now held a comfortable lead in the best of five match.

### Game Three


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gideon+Jura)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura)
Although both players kept their opening hands, Penton was once again without an explosive start, beginning game three with [Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix), playing straight into Timely [Reinforcements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reinforcements). Penton cast a second Phoenix, and pushed Sajgalik back down to 20. On the plus side, Penton had drawn into [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs), which could seriously hurt Sajgalik if it resolved.


It didn't. [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) dealt with that particular threat.


Out came [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), who forced Penton's team to attack him. With a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and a third [Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix), Gideon bit the dust. For four mana Sajgalik cast Day of judgment, and followed it up with [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). That died to [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) at the cost of four life for Penton, who was now down to 8, while Sajgalik was up at 16. Sajgalik activated his [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) to drop Penton to 4, and repeated the dose one turn later to complete a thoroughly one-sided demolition.
