There's a new show coming soon to an internet near you. For each of the next ten Thursdays (starting April 28), you can watch the Community Super League live on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) (or catch up with the episodes later on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg)).


The goal for this show is to highlight the fun side of *Magic*, so we're going to have a new format every week, and some of them will be a little on the wacky side. We also want to show off the amazing community of people that *Magic* tends to attract, and we're really excited about the cast we've assembled. Here, check this out:

We think this will be a lot of fun, and we hope you'll check us out starting next week! Here's a Q&A for those of you who might want more details.


**What's the difference between this and other Super Leagues?**


We're borrowing the same broad format of having everyone in the league play one match per week on *Magic Online* while the players all take turns doing commentary, but with this one we're going to focus on making the show as casual-friendly and as accessible to new players as possible. We think with this group of players we can do a show that is fun to watch whether you've been playing for 20 years or 20 days.


**What's happening to Vintage Super League?**


Vintage Super League is also starting a new season next week. VSL will run on Tuesday nights at 6 p.m. PT while CSL runs on Thursdays. Next Tuesday's kickoff show for season five of VSL will actually be the beginning of a qualifier tournament to determine which new players get to join the league. We had a five-way tie for last place in season four, so there are five spots up for grabs. Here are the twelve players who will each be trying to win one of the seats:

With [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) just added to the Vintage restricted list, it will be really interesting to see what decks people are going to show up with as they attempt to join me, Luis Scott-Vargas, David Ochoa, Eric Froehlich, and Rich Shay in the league.


**What's the format for Community Super League?**


Everybody will play everybody else once over the course of a nine-week regular season, and then the Top 3 will advance to the playoff show. Each week will have a different format, ranging from No Banned List Modern to Momir Basic to Tribal Wars to Ironroot Chef.


For week one, we're going to keep things relatively simple and use decks from the Pro Tour Gauntlet, which will have just launched on *Magic Online* the day before our first show. (These will be the decks R&D chooses as the top-performing decks from this weekend's [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi) in Madrid, Spain, which you should also watch, of course.)


Since the players aren't building their own decks for week one, they won't earn any points toward the Brewmaster Standings.


**Brewmaster Standings?!**


Yes!


In addition to keeping track of win/loss records, we're also going to keep track of who brings the sweetest decks to the table by polling the live audience.


**So who is in the league?**


You can see everyone in the video above (major props to our technical producer, Athena Huey, for putting that together), but in case you can't watch for some reason, here is the roster:


* Kenji Egashira—Legendary streamer at [twitch.tv/NumotTheNummy](https://www.twitch.tv/NumotTheNummy)
* Aaron Forsythe—Senior Director of *Magic* R&D
* Gaby Spartz—Streamer at [twitch.tv/GabySpartz](https://www.twitch.tv/GabySpartz) and premier event commentator
* Marshall Sutcliffe—[Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/) host and premier event commentator
* [Magic the Amateuring](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/)—Maria and Meghan will be teaming up for this, just like they do for their podcast
* [The Girlfriend Bracket](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/author/the-girlfriend-bracket/)—Erin, Hallie, Katie, and Kriz: superfriends and cohosts of a weekly *Magic* podcast
* The Professor, from [Tolarian Community College](https://www.youtube.com/user/tolariancommunity)—The man right in the middle of some of the best and most creative *Magic* content on YouTube
* Wedge from [The Mana Source](https://www.youtube.com/user/themanasource)—Another superstar in the world of *Magic* YouTube content
* Paul Cheon—Streamer on [twitch.tv/HAUMPH](https://www.twitch.tv/HAUMPH) and the league's only Pro Tour regular
* [LoadingReadyRun](http://loadingreadyrun.com/)—Because no internet hijinks would be complete without them

There are also rumors of a guest flavor judge for Ironroot Chef Week.


**This sounds awesome, how am I going to wait eight days?**


Well, you could do a lot worse than following all the links in the previous section. These are ten of the best and brightest in the world of *Magic* content creation, and all their stuff is well worth checking out. Meanwhile, I'm just as excited as you are to see how this all comes together. It really should be awesome, so be sure to tune in at [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) beginning April 28!
