### The Matches


**B Seat - Weiss vs. Luna**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Leafcrown%20Dryad)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown%20Dryad)
While their teammates were still shuffling up these two were already in the thick of things. Unfortunately for Luna, he was stuck on three mountains with no play, and could only watch as Weiss rolled over him with [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad), [Flame-Wreathed Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame-Wreathed+Phoenix) and [Pharagax Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharagax+Giant).


Luna quickly returned the favor with a beatdown start of [Pharika's Chosen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Chosen), [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) and [Mogis, God of Slaughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter). Weiss was forced to hide behind a [Setessan Oathsworn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn) with [Fearsome Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fearsome+Temper) on it. Mogis continued to work on his lifetotal and was soon manifest thanks to Luna's wealth of permanents. The game ended in his favor shortly thereafter.


The deciding game was slow to develop, and that played directly into Luna's draw. He got ahead on cards thanks to [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) and [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax), and was able to match each of Weiss's threats with removal. Soon Weiss was out of cards and Luna was summoning [Spawn of Thraxes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawn+of+Thraxes).


Pozzo/Luna/de Nicola 1 - Guimaraes/Weiss/Fraga 0


**A Seat - Pozzo vs. Guimaraes**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Loyal%20Pegasus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loyal%20Pegasus)
Pozzo won the die roll and hit the ground running. His curve of [Loyal Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loyal+Pegasus) into [Vanguard of Brimaz](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vanguard+of+Brimaz) into [Leonin Snarecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster) had Guimaraes on the back foot early. Guimares managed to trade away the ground creatures, but Pozzo found [Cavalry Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalry+Pegasus) to keep up pressure in the air. He added [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) to speed up the clock and Guimaraes was unable to stop them in time.


Guimaraes flipped the script in game two. He led out with Oreskos Swifclaw and [Elite Skirmisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher), getting through some damage and forcing trades from Pozzo. He replaced them with the mighty [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) and an [Akroan Skyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard), but was stuck on just three plains. Pozzo found [Akroan Mastiff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Mastiff) to answer the Hero, then put [Eidolon of Countless Battles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Countless+Battles) on his [Stonewise Fortifier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewise+Fortifier) and started attacking. Guimares found his fourth land and summoned [Dawnbringer Charioteers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnbringer+Charioteers), and on his next turn entered into a conference with his teammate Weiss, who had just finished his match, over what his plan should be.


Meanwhile...


**C Seat - Kevin Fraga vs Nicolas de Nicola**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Golden%20Hind)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden%20Hind)
Their first game had been a drawn-out affair. Despite a turn-two [Golden Hind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Hind), de Nicola hadn't been able to get a jump on Fraga, who slowed him down with [Brain Maggot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot) and [Pin to the Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pin+to+the+Earth). Still, de Nicola had [Sigiled Starfish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigiled+Starfish), so as the game drew out he had the advantage. The turning point came when he summoned [Nessian Wilds Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Wilds+Ravager), which hit play as a 12/12. Fraga had been banking on his [Pharika's Chosen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Chosen) and a handful of tricks to keep the giant monster at bay. A [Sudden Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm) from de Nicola caught him tapped out, and he took a big hit down to eight. From there, de Nicola was able to keep enough pressure on Fraga that he was forced to spend [Hubris](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hubris) for little gain, and then finish him off with a pump spell two turns later.


In the second game, Fraga took some damage from [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) wearing [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad). He bought himself some time with [Sudden Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm), then drew into the [Pin to the Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pin+to+the+Earth) he needed. Shortly thereafter he was swinging overhead with a flier, but that only played into de Nicola's plans. [Hour of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Need) traded the worthless Satyr for a 4/4 flier that blocked without incident. Fraga couldn't find a bounce spell and was soon dead to the flying beatdown.


**Pozzo/Luna/de Nicola 2 - Guimaraes/Weiss/Fraga**


Now that their match result was moot, Pozzo and Guimaraes shook hands and wished each other good luck in the coming rounds.
