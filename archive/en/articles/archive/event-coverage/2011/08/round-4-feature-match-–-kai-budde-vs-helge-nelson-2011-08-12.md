Kai Budde really needs no introduction. He basically won every type of tournament in existence, most of them a couple of times. And he came well prepared and in full juggernaut mode into this tournament. He was still undefeated, coming into this round.


His opponent, Helge Nelson, on the other hand didn't even know he would play this tournament yesterday. He won a Last-Chance Qualifier and proceeded to win his first three matches as well.



### Game One



Nelson won the die-roll, but had no one-drop, while Budde led with [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) off a [Copperline Gorge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperline+Gorge). Nelson had [Kargan Dragonlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) on turn two, Budde had [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), then played [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), and passed the turn.


Nelson killed [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) with [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), summoned [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), and attacked for the first 4 points of damage. Budde revealed [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle). On his turn, he cast the 1/3 and shot [Kargan Dragonlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord) with [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt).


Nelson retaliated with [Searing Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze). Budde went to put his [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) away, but was stopped by Nelson: "No land, so 1 damage to the [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds) and 1 to you." Nelson had no attacks and passed the turn.


Budde cast [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), paying full price in mana, no life, and passed the turn. Nelson had [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) for [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle), attacked with [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), revealing [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) on top of Budde's library and putting him opponent at 13.


Budde summoned [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), played and cracked [Scalding Tarn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) and cast [Urabrask the Hidden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urabrask+the+Hidden). [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) attacked for 2, while Urabrask stayed on defense.


Nelson, still with no third land, cast [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) and passed the turn. Budde's [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) turned [Urabrask the Hidden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urabrask+the+Hidden) into [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan), and when Nelson had no play, the red Giant finished him off on the next attack.

### Game Two



Nelson had a one-drop this time, but [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) still eluded him. He had to settle for [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) instead. Budde matched his one-drop with [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise).


[Searing Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze) killed the [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds). Budde summoned more [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), but had no second land. Nelson sacrificed [Arid Mesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa), cast [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), and killed the new [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds) with his [Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer).


Kai still didn't have a second land, and no more [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds). Nelson played a second [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) went to two counters, Budde to 11. On his next turn, he attacked with one of his [Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer)s and passed the turn.


Finally, Budde drew [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and summoned the [Sylvan Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Ranger), which had been on his opening hand, searching up [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). While Nelson seemed to be out of gas, except for his [Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine), Budde had more: Next up were [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), the aforementioned [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), and [Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash) for one of the [Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer)s.


But [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) had accumulated five counters already, and Budde was at 9. He changed that with [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth), but Nelson's kicked [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) at end of turn changed that right back. Also, this brought [Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) to six counters. On Nelson's turn, [Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine) went to seven and together with [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) shot Budde dead right there.

### Game Three



This time, Budde had to do without [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), whereas Nelson had the first turn-one [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) of the match. Budde got 2 damage and a [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) for free. He cast [Sylvan Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Ranger), while Nelson summoned a second [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) as well as [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), beating Budde down to 13.


Budde made [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), used another [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), cast [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and a second [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra). Nelson played [Teetering Peaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks), pumping one of his [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide)s, killed one Cobra with [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), and attacked. Budde traded the [Teetering Peaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks)-pumped [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) against his one remaining [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and took 2 (down to 10).


Budde frowned at his options, then summoned [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph) to make a copy of his opponent's [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide). [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) killed the opposing [Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin) and Nelson's own [Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin) brought Budde down to 8. [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth) made that 12. But the [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) rebound and a [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) activation killed the 4/4 body. Nelson cast another [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and hit Budde for 4.


Budde made [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and a copy of it with [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image). Nelson killed the latter, ensuring at least some combat damage, and that was all it took. He had enough burn to finish him off.
