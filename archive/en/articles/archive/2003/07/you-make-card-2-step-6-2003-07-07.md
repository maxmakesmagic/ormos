Well, when we posted the initial vote, we said we weren't going to have a run-off. You see, we were a bit behind on the vote due to the delay of reading all the mechanics and all the votes last year had a clear winner.


And then this vote happened. Out of 9202 votes, the #1 pick was ahead of the #2 pick by nine votes. Nine votes! In addition, the #3 and #4 picks were within 1% of the #1 pick. In short, we had ourselves a giant four way tie.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mechanic A** | 1399 | 15.20% |
| **Mechanic B** | 368 | 4.00% |
| **Mechanic C** | 418 | 4.54% |
| **Mechanic D** | 1110 | 12.06% |
| **Mechanic E** | 1301 | 14.14% |
| **Mechanic F** | 1390 | 15.11% |
| **Mechanic G** | 474 | 5.15% |
| **Mechanic H** | 685 | 7.44% |
| **Mechanic I** | 1346 | 14.63% |
| **Mechanic J** | 711 | 7.73% |
| **Total** | 9202 | 100.00% |

After some discussion, we felt that a vote this close demanded a run-off. So, we're having one. The four mechanics in the run-off are:




|  |
| --- |
| **Mechanic A** 
 You may play land cards in your graveyard as though they were in your hand.
**Mechanic E**
 Players play with their hands revealed.
 During each player's turn, that player may play cards in other players' hands as though they were cards in his or her hand.
 During each player's turn, other players can't play spells.
**Mechanic F** 
 M: You may pay target creature's mana cost. If you do, you gain control of that creature. *(This effect doesn't end at end of turn. Mana cost includes color.)*
**Mechanic I** 
 Discard a card from your hand: Remove target spell you control from the stack and return it to its owner's hand. *(The spell has no effect.)* |

We're going to keep this quick, so voting ends Thursday, July 10th at 11:59 PM Pacific. If you were a fan of one of these mechanics, remember to vote again. And if you voted for a different mechanic, your vote is one of the ones that's going to make the difference. And tell your friends to vote, too.


Happy voting!


Mark
