![Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aquamoeba)These two accomplished players find themselves in the position to make Top 8 after a grueling fifteen rounds of swiss. Dirk Baberowski is playing a fairly standard Sligh deck that put Patrick Mello in the top 8 already. Amiel is running his OBC deck with a few [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze)s thrown in. Blue/Green madness seems to actually be a fine deck for this environment if you can get a turn 2 [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) or [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). Flying 6/6s are good in every format, I guess.### Game 1

After a very thorough deck check Dirk won the die roll and decided to play first. Both players kept their opening hands and Dirk kicked things off with a turn 1 Pup. He didn't play a land on turn two and Amiel played a [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), an obvious problem for Sligh. Another [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) showed up on turn three followed by yet another of the annoying doggies on turn four. Dirk's Pups couldn't stand up to Amiel's [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel)s at all and when Amiel attacked on turn 5 he had enough cards to win the game right there.

### Game 2

This game was a true showcase of how powerful the blue/green deck can be when it draws the right cards. Turn one Study, discarding Walla. Turn two [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). Turn three [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). Dirk tried to overcome the ideal OBC hand but when the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) sprang forth another [Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) his army of Goblins and Pups got destroyed in his attack step. An [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and an [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) were quick to clean up the pieces.

**Final Result:** Tenenbaum 2 - Baberowski 0

Two rather unexciting games see Amiel reach his first constructed GP Top 8. Dirk will have to try again next time.
