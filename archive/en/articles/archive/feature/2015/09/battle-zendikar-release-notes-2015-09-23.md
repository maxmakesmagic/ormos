The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [**Wizards.com/CustomerService**](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

---

**Zendikar Expeditions**


Enlist the land itself in the battle against the Eldrazi with *Zendikar Expeditions*. This special set includes Zendikari versions of exciting lands from throughout *Magic's* history.


* There are 25 *Zendikar Expeditions* cards that appear in *Battle for Zendikar* booster packs. The remaining 20 cards will appear in *Oath of the Gatewatch* booster packs. *Zendikar Expeditions* cards have their own expansion symbol.
* *Zendikar Expeditions* cards are very rare. You can expect to open one only a little more frequently than a premium foil *Battle for Zendikar* mythic rare.
* *Zendikar Expeditions* cards appearing in *Battle for Zendikar* booster packs are playable in any Limited event using those booster packs. In a Sealed Deck tournament, those cards are part of your card pool. In a Booster Draft tournament, you must draft those cards for them to be included in your card pool.
* However, *Zendikar* Expeditions cards are not legal in any Constructed format the cards weren't legal in before. Appearing in *Battle for Zendikar* booster packs does **not** make them legal in Standard.
* Premium foil English *Zendikar Expeditions* cards appear in booster packs of all languages.



---

**Rule Change: Mulligans**


The traditional rules for mulligans are changing beginning with *Battle for Zendikar* Prerelease events. For reference, the previous rule:


At the beginning of the game, each player draws cards equal to that player's *starting hand size* (usually seven). In turn order, each player chooses to either keep those cards as an *opening hand* or mulligan by shuffling those cards back into the library and drawing a new hand with one less card. Each hand drawn this way may also be kept or mulliganed, with additional mulligans drawing one less card each time until each player has kept an opening hand.


The change that takes effect on September 26 is an addition to the existing rule:


After players have kept their opening hands, each player who kept fewer cards than his or her starting hand size looks at the top card of his or her library. That player may then put that card on the bottom of his or her library. (This is essentially the "scry 1" keyword action).


* If multiple players mulligan, the starting player is the first one to look at the top card of his or her library and decide whether to move it to the bottom. Then, in turn order, each other player who mulliganed does the same.
* No matter how many mulligans you take, you only look at the top card of your library once, after you've decided to keep your hand. You can't look at multiple cards or move multiple cards to the bottom of your library this way.
* In some multiplayer formats, you don't lose a card from your opening hand after your first mulligan. You would need to take a second mulligan before being allowed to look at the top card of your library or move it to the bottom.
* Each player who mulliganed decides whether or not to move the top card of his or her library to the bottom before any player uses the "opening hand" abilities of cards such as Leylines.



---

**New Keyword: Devoid**


The Eldrazi transcend the colors of mana as we know them. Devoid is a new keyword ability that makes a card with the ability colorless, regardless of that spell's mana cost.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_PuL3HoqHWQ.png)



> 
> Dust Stalker  
> 
> 2BR  
> 
> Creature — Eldrazi  
> 
> 5/3  
> 
> Devoid *(This card has no color.)*  
> 
> Haste  
> 
> At the beginning of each end step, if you control no other colorless creatures, return Dust Stalker to its owner's hand.
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for devoid are as follows:


702.113. Devoid


702.113a Devoid is a characteristic-defining ability. "Devoid" means "This object is colorless." This ability works everywhere, even outside the game. See rule 604.3.


* Cards with devoid use frames that are variations of the transparent frame traditionally used for Eldrazi. The top part of the card features some color over a background based on the texture of the hedrons that once imprisoned the Eldrazi. This coloration is intended to aid deck building and gameplay.
* A card with devoid is just colorless. It's not colorless and the colors of mana in its mana cost.
* Other cards and abilities can give a card with devoid color. If that happens, it's just the new color, not that color and colorless.
* Devoid works in all zones, not just on the battlefield.
* If a card loses devoid, it will still be colorless. This is because effects that change an object's color (like the one created by devoid) are considered before the object loses devoid.



---

**New Keyword: Ingest**


The Eldrazi ravage anything in their path, including the composite matter of those who oppose them. Ingest is a new keyword ability found on creatures that exile cards from an opponent's library by dealing combat damage to that player.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_iMDgSBQXcb.png)



> 
> Mist Intruder  
> 
> 1U  
> 
> Creature — Eldrazi Drone  
> 
> 1/2  
> 
> Devoid *(This card has no color.)*  
> 
> Flying  
> 
> Ingest *(Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, that player exiles the top card of his or her library.)*
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for ingest are as follows:


702.114. Ingest


702.114a Ingest is a triggered ability. "Ingest" means "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, that player exiles the top card of his or her library."


702.114b If a creature has multiple instances of ingest, each triggers separately.


* The card is exiled face up.
* If the player has no cards in his or her library when the ingest ability resolves, nothing happens. That player won't lose the game (until he or she has to draw a card from an empty library).



---

**New Eldrazi Theme: Processors**


Several cards in this set, most with the new creature type Processor, can use cards in exile owned by an opponent as "fuel" for various effects.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_Yi2uchXkXz.png)



> 
> Wasteland Strangler  
> 
> 2B  
> 
> Creature — Eldrazi Processor  
> 
> 3/2  
> 
> Devoid *(This card has no color.)*  
> 
> When Wasteland Strangler enters the battlefield, you may put a card an opponent owns from exile into that player's graveyard. If you do, target creature gets -3/-3 until end of turn.
> 
> 
> 


* If a spell or ability requires that you put more than one exiled card into the graveyard, you may choose cards owned by different opponents. Each card chosen will be put into its owner's graveyard.
* If a replacement effect will cause cards that would be put into a graveyard from anywhere to be exiled instead (such as the one created by [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost)), you can still put an exiled card into its opponent's graveyard. The card becomes a new object and remains in exile. In this situation, you can't use a single exiled card if required to put more than one exiled card into the graveyard. Conversely, you could use the same card in this situation if two separate spells or abilities each required you to put a single exiled card into its owner's graveyard.
* You can't look at face-down cards in exile unless an effect allows you to.
* Face-down cards in exile are grouped using two criteria: what caused them to be exiled face down and when they were exiled face down. If you want to put a face-down card in exile into its owner's graveyard, you must first choose one of these groups and then choose a card from within that group at random. For example, say an artifact causes your opponent to exile three cards from his or her hand face down. Then on a later turn, that artifact causes your opponent to exile another two cards face down. If you use Wasteland Strangler to put one of those cards into his or her graveyard, you would pick the first or second pile and put a card chosen at random from that pile into the graveyard.



---

**New Eldrazi Theme: Eldrazi Scions**


The lower ranks of the Eldrazi forces have evolved since we last saw them. Several cards in this set cause you to put Eldrazi Scion creature tokens onto the battlefield. These tokens all have the same characteristics.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_b3DTMl3YFz.png)



> 
> Blisterpod  
> 
> G  
> 
> Creature — Eldrazi Drone  
> 
> 1/1  
> 
> Devoid *(This card has no color.)*  
> 
> When Blisterpod dies, put a 1/1 colorless Eldrazi Scion creature token onto the battlefield. It has "Sacrifice this creature: Add 1 to your mana pool."
> 
> 
> 


* Eldrazi Scions are similar to Eldrazi Spawn, seen in the *Zendikar* block. Note that Eldrazi Scions are 1/1, not 0/1.
* Eldrazi and Scion are each separate creature types. Anything that affects Eldrazi will affect these tokens, for example.
* Sacrificing an Eldrazi Scion creature token to add 1 to your mana pool is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
* Some instants and sorceries that create Eldrazi Scions require targets. If all targets for such a spell have become illegal by the time that spell tries to resolve, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any Eldrazi Scions.



---

**Returning Eldrazi Theme: "When you cast" triggered abilities**


Several cards in this set have a triggered ability that triggers when you cast that spell. Others have an ability that triggers when you cast other spells.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_CKuK2PXTrB.png)



> 
> [Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower)  
> 
> 6  
> 
> Creature — Eldrazi  
> 
> 5/8  
> 
> When you cast [Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower), target opponent exiles the top four cards of his or her library, then you may put any number of land cards that player owns from exile onto the battlefield under your control.
> 
> 
> 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_x75uLthl5b.png)



> 
> Nettle Drone  
> 
> 2R  
> 
> Creature — Eldrazi Drone  
> 
> 3/1  
> 
> Devoid *(This card has no color.)*  
> 
> T: Nettle Drone deals 1 damage to each opponent.  
> 
> Whenever you cast a colorless spell, untap Nettle Drone.
> 
> 
> 


* These abilities will resolve before the spell that caused them to trigger.
* Once one of those abilities triggers, it doesn't matter what happens to the spell. The ability will remain on the stack even if the spell is countered before the ability resolves.



---

**New Keyword: Awaken**


Besieged by the Eldrazi, the land of Zendikar rises up to defend itself. Awaken is a new keyword found on instants and sorceries that has the potential to turn lands you control into Elemental creatures.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_t5ILhwNxPj.png)



> 
> [Sheer Drop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sheer+Drop)  
> 
> 2W  
> 
> Sorcery  
> 
> Destroy target tapped creature.  
> 
> Awaken 3—5W *(If you cast this spell for 5W, also put three +1/+1 counters on target land you control and it becomes a 0/0 Elemental creature with haste. It's still a land.)*
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for awaken are as follows:


702.112. Awaken


702.112a Awaken appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two abilities: a static ability that functions while the spell with awaken is on the stack and a spell ability. "Awaken N—[cost]" means "You may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell's mana cost as you cast this spell" and "If this spell's awaken cost was paid, put N +1/+1 counters on target land you control. That land becomes a 0/0 Elemental creature with haste. It's still a land." Paying a spell's awaken cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.


702.112b The controller of a spell with awaken chooses the target of the awaken spell ability only if that player chose to pay the spell's awaken cost. Otherwise the spell is cast as if it didn't have that target.


* You can cast a spell with awaken for its mana cost and get only its first effect. If you cast a spell for its awaken cost, you'll get both effects.
* If the non-awaken part of the spell requires a target, you must choose a legal target. You can't cast the spell if you can't choose a legal target for each instance of the word "target" (though you only need a legal target for the awaken ability if you're casting the spell for its awaken cost).
* If a spell with awaken has multiple targets (including the land you control), and some but not all of those targets become illegal by the time the spell tries to resolve, the spell won't affect the illegal targets in any way.
* If the non-awaken part of the spell doesn't require a target and you cast the spell for its awaken cost, then the spell will be countered if the target land you control becomes illegal before the spell resolves (such as due to being destroyed in response to the spell being cast).
* The land will retain any other types, subtypes, or supertypes it previously had. It will also retain any mana abilities it had as a result of those subtypes. For example, a Forest that's turned into a creature this way can still be tapped for G.
* Awaken doesn't give the land you control a color. As most lands are colorless, in most cases the resulting land creature will also be colorless.



---

**New Ability Word: Rally**


Rally is a new ability word associated with the returning creature type Ally. Rally is used to highlight abilities that trigger whenever the creature with the ability or another Ally enters the battlefield under your control. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_kvoSBvPYkA.png)



> 
> Grovetender Druids  
> 
> 2GW  
> 
> Creature — Elf Druid Ally  
> 
> 3/3  
> *Rally* — Whenever Grovetender Druids or another Ally enters the battlefield under your control, you may pay 1. If you do, put a 1/1 green Plant creature token onto the battlefield.
> 
> 
> 


* When an Ally enters the battlefield under your control, each rally ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
* If a creature with a rally ability enters the battlefield under your control at the same time as other Allies, that ability will trigger once for each of those creatures and once for the creature with the ability itself.



---

**New Ability Word: Converge**


All Zendikari must join together to fight off the Eldrazi threat. Converge is a new ability word that highlights the effects of cards that somehow depend on how many colors of mana you spend to cast them. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_u35IkOK0eN.png)



> 
> Radiant Flames  
> 
> 2R  
> 
> Sorcery  
> *Converge —* Radiant Flames deals X damage to each creature, where X is the number of colors of mana spent to cast Radiant Flames.
> 
> 
> 


* The maximum number of colors of mana you can spend to cast a spell is five. Colorless is not a color. Note that the cost of a spell with converge may limit how many colors of mana you can spend.
* Unless a spell or ability allows you to, you can't choose to pay more mana for a spell with a converge ability just to spend more colors of mana. Likewise, if a spell or ability reduces the amount of mana it costs you to cast a spell with converge, you can't ignore that cost reduction in order to spend more colors of mana.
* If there are any alternative or additional costs to cast a spell with a converge ability, the mana spent to pay those costs will count. For example, if an effect makes sorcery spells cost 1 more to cast, you could pay WUBR to cast Radiant Flames and deal 4 damage to each creature.
* If you cast a spell with converge without spending any mana to cast it (perhaps because an effect allowed you to cast it without paying its mana cost), then the number of colors spent to cast it will be zero.
* If a spell with a converge ability is copied, no mana was spent to cast the copy, so the number of colors of mana spent to cast the spell will be zero. The number of colors spent to cast the original spell is not copied.



---

**Returning Ability Word: Landfall**


The land continues to play an important role in Zendikar's struggle against the Eldrazi. Landfall is an ability word that first appeared in the *Zendikar* set. It highlights abilities that trigger whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_o1PZtKj7TY.png)



> 
> Guul Draz Overseer  
> 
> 4BB  
> 
> Creature — Vampire  
> 
> 3/4  
> 
> Flying  
> *Landfall* — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, other creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn. If that land is a Swamp, those creatures get +2/+0 until end of turn instead.
> 
> 
> 


* A landfall ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability puts a land onto the battlefield under your control.
* When a land enters the battlefield under your control, each landfall ability of the permanents you control will trigger. You can put them on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
* If the ability has an additional or replacement effect that depends on the land having a certain basic land type, the ability will check that land's type as the ability resolves. If, at that time, the land that entered the battlefield is no longer on the battlefield, use its types when it left the battlefield to determine what happens.



---

**Theme: "Whenever you gain life" triggered abilities**


Several cards in this set have an ability that triggers whenever you gain life.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_7hjFtHaAQY.png)



> 
> Serene Steward  
> 
> 1W  
> 
> Creature — Human Cleric Ally  
> 
> 2/2  
> 
> Whenever you gain life, you may pay W. If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.
> 
> 
> 


* The ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Drana's Emissary or 7 life from Nissa's Renewal.
* A creature with lifelink dealing combat damage is a single life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, the ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.



---

**Cycle: Nonbasic lands with basic land types**


This set includes a cycle of nonbasic lands with basic land types. Each one produces one of two colors of mana. These lands enter the battlefield tapped unless you control two or more basic lands.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_DQcKeh1wKe.png)



> 
> Canopy Vista  
> 
> Land — Forest Plains  
> *(T: Add G or W to your mana pool.)*  
> 
> Canopy Vista enters the battlefield tapped unless you control two or more basic lands.
> 
> 
> 


* Even though these lands have basic land types, they are not basic lands because "basic" doesn't appear on their type line. Notably, controlling two or more of them won't allow others to enter the battlefield untapped.
* However, because these cards have basic land types, effects that specify a basic land type without also specifying that the land be basic can affect them. For example, a spell or ability that reads "Destroy target Forest" can target Canopy Vista, while one that reads "Destroy target basic Forest" cannot.
* If one of these lands enters the battlefield at the same time as any number of basic lands, those other lands are not counted when determining if this land enters the battlefield tapped or untapped.

**CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_BmzgxHtFQJ.png)



> 
> Adverse Conditions  
> 
> 3U  
> 
> Instant  
> 
> Devoid *(This card has no color.)*  
> 
> Tap up to two target creatures. Those creatures don't untap during their controller's next untap step. Put a 1/1 colorless Eldrazi Scion creature token onto the battlefield. It has "Sacrifice this creature: Add 1 to your mana pool."
> 
> 
> 


* You can cast Adverse Conditions with no targets. When it resolves, you'll get an Eldrazi Scion. However, if you cast Adverse Conditions with any targets and all of those targets are illegal as it tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't get the Eldrazi Scion in that case.
* Adverse Conditions tracks the creatures, but not their controller. If either of the creatures changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step has come around, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.

> *Landfall* — Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, you may pay 4RR. If you do, return Akoum Firebird from your graveyard to the battlefield.
> 
> 
> 


* If, during its controller's declare attackers step, Akoum Firebird is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. If he or she doesn't, Akoum Firebird doesn't have to attack.
* The landfall ability triggers only if Akoum Firebird is in your graveyard at the moment the land enters the battlefield.
* Players can respond to the triggered ability, but once it starts resolving and you decide whether to pay 4RR, it's too late for anyone to respond.

* Check the power of each creature as Aligned Hedron Network's ability resolves to determine if it's exiled. It doesn't matter who controls the creature.
* If Aligned Hedron Network exiles multiple creatures, those cards all return to the battlefield at the same time.
* If Aligned Hedron Network leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, no creatures will be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist.
* If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
* The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after Aligned Hedron Network leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Aligned Hedron Network's owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
* In some very rare situations, Aligned Hedron Network may enter the battlefield as a creature with power 5 or greater. If this happens, Aligned Hedron Network will exile itself along with other creatures with power 5 or greater. Those cards will immediately return to the battlefield. If this causes a loop with Aligned Hedron Network continually exiling and returning itself, the game will be a draw unless a player breaks the loop somehow.

* Players can respond to [Bone Splinters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Splinters) only after it's been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to remove the creature you sacrificed to stop you from casting the spell.

* If, during its controller's declare blockers step, a creature the defending player controls is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having it block, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. If he or she doesn't, the creature doesn't have to block.
* If a creature can't legally block Breaker of Armies but could block another attacking creature, it may do so. Likewise, if a creature the defending player controls can't block Breaker of Armies unless its controller pays a cost, its controller may decline to pay that cost and block a different attacking creature.
* If more than one Breaker of Armies is attacking, the controller of each creature that could block them chooses which one that creature blocks. In this case, creatures that can block multiple creatures must block as many attacking Breaker of Armies as possible.

* If you cast the exiled card, you do so as part of the resolution of Bring to Light. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored, but other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") are not.

>

* Conduit of Ruin's last ability doesn't change the mana cost or converted mana cost of any spell. It changes only the total cost you actually pay.
* Conduit of Ruin's last ability will look at the entire turn, even if Conduit of Ruin wasn't on the battlefield for some of it. Notably, if you cast Conduit of Ruin in a turn, then no other creature spell you cast that turn can be your first.
* Conduit of Ruin's last ability can't reduce the amount of colored mana you pay for a spell. It reduces only the generic component of that mana cost.
* If you control more than one Conduit of Ruin, the last ability of each of them applies only to the first creature spell you cast each turn, not to different spells; the first creature spell you cast each turn will cost 4 less.
* The first creature spell you cast each turn doesn't necessarily have to be the first spell you cast. You could cast a sorcery spell and then cast a creature spell that would get the discount.
* If there are additional costs to cast a spell, or if the cost to cast a spell is increased by an effect, apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
* The cost reduction can apply to alternative costs (such as dash costs).
* If the first creature spell you cast in a turn has X in its mana cost, you choose the value of X before calculating the spell's total cost. For example, if the first creature spell you cast in a turn has a mana cost of XG, you could choose 2 as the value of X and pay G to cast the spell.
* If the first creature spell you cast in a turn has converge, you can't ignore the cost reduction of Conduit of Ruin's last ability in order to spend more colors of mana.

* Gideon's first ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Specifically, your rally abilities won't trigger. (Of course, Gideon's second ability will cause rally abilities to trigger.)
* If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his tap abilities (if he gains any).
* Gideon's first ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human, Soldier, and Ally. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human, Soldier, and Ally are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
* If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his first ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.

* Guardian of Tazeem's landfall ability can target a creature that's already tapped. If the land that caused it to trigger was an Island, that creature won't untap during its controller's next untap step.
* The ability tracks the creature, but not its controller. If the creature changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step has come around, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.

* Herald of Kozilek's last ability doesn't change the mana cost or converted mana cost of any spell. It changes only the total cost you actually pay.
* Herald of Kozilek's last ability can't reduce the amount of colored mana you pay for a spell. It reduces only the generic component of that mana cost.
* If there are additional costs to cast a spell, or if the cost to cast a spell is increased by an effect, apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
* The cost reduction can apply to alternative costs.
* If a colorless spell you cast has X in its mana cost, you choose the value of X before calculating the spell's total cost. For example, if that spell's mana cost is X, you could choose 5 as the value of X and pay 4 to cast the spell.

* A land that becomes a creature may be affected by "summoning sickness." You can't attack with it or use any of its tap abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature nor when it entered the battlefield.
* This land is colorless until the last ability gives it colors.
* When a land becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
* An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature's power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if Lumbering Falls has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 6/6 creature that's still a land.

* Use the number of isolation counters on Quarantine Field as its triggered ability is put on the stack to determine how many targets you may choose. Once the targets are chosen, the number of targets the ability has is locked in. Changing the number of isolation counters on Quarantine Field won't change how many nonland permanents are exiled.
* If Quarantine Field exiles multiple permanents, those cards all return to the battlefield at the same time.
* If Quarantine Field leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, no permanents will be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanents will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanents will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
* The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after Quarantine Field leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Quarantine Field's owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

If there's a cost associated with having Reckless Cohort attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. If he or she doesn't, Reckless Cohort doesn't have to attack.

* The cards are exiled from the library face up.
* If that player has one card in his or her library when Sire of Stagnation's triggered ability resolves, that card will be exiled. If his or her library has zero cards, no cards are exiled. In both cases, you'll still draw two cards. That player won't lose the game (until he or she attempts to draw a card from an empty library).

* Once you legally activate the ability, it doesn't matter what happens to the other colorless creature. The ability will resolve and create a regeneration shield even if you don't control another colorless creature at that time.
* Skitterskin's activated ability doesn't depend on Skitterskin being colorless. If it gains one or more colors, you can still activate the ability if you control another creature that's colorless.

* Skyline Cascade's triggered ability doesn't tap the creature. It can target any creature, tapped or untapped. If that creature is already untapped at the beginning of its controller's next untap step, the effect won't do anything.
* The triggered ability tracks the creature, but not its controller. If the creature changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step has come around, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.

* You can choose any value for X. The value chosen for X doesn't directly affect the number of +1/+1 counters Skyrider Elf enters the battlefield with, but it does let you pay more mana and thus spend more colors of mana to cast it. For example, you can choose 0 for the value of X and pay GU to cast Skyrider Elf for two +1/+1 counters. You can also choose 3 for the value of X, making its mana cost 3GU, and pay WUBRG for five +1/+1 counters.

* If Stasis Snare leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.

* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Stasis Snare leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Stasis Snare's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

* You choose which ability [Veteran Warleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Warleader) gains as the last ability resolves, not as you activate it.
* Vigilance matters only as attackers are declared. Giving a creature vigilance after that point won't untap it, even if it's attacking.

* Effects that increase or reduce the cost to cast a spell don't affect that spell's converted mana cost.
* For spells with X in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine if the spell's converted mana cost is even or not. For example, your opponent could cast Endless One (with mana cost X) with X equal to 5, but not with X equal to 6.
* For creatures on the battlefield with X in their mana costs, the value for X is 0. [Mistcutter Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) (a creature with mana cost XG) could block, but Endless One could not.
* The converted mana cost of a face-down creature is 0. Void Winnower will stop face-down creatures from blocking.

* The ability triggers whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell that targets only Zada and no other object or player.
* If you cast an instant or sorcery spell that has multiple targets, but it's targeting only Zada with all of them, Zada's ability will trigger.
* Any creature you control that couldn't be targeted by the original spell (due to shroud, protection abilities, targeting restrictions, or any other reason) is just ignored by Zada's ability.
* You control all the copies. You choose the order the copies are put onto the stack. The original spell will be on the stack beneath those copies and will resolve last.
* The copies that the ability creates are created on the stack, so they're not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (like Zada's ability itself) won't trigger.
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) does), the copies have the same value of X.
* The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.
