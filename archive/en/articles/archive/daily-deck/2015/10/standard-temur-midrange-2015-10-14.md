Although we've been playing *Battle for Zendikar* Standard for a few weeks now in *Magic*, it just became legal on *Magic Online* last week. The *Magic Online* metagame is usually different from the outside world, so I was excited to see what players came up with. One of the more interesting decks I found came from JakefromStateFarm, who went 3-1 in a Standard Daily with a Temur deck using some sweet new *Battle for Zendikar cards*.


This deck hasn't really changed too much from last year. The main differences are the ramp and land options available, which in turn made some older cards that weren't seeing play much better. Aside from lands, [Kiora, Master of the Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+Master+of+the+Depths) is the only *Battle for Zendikar* card in the deck, but it's also the most crucial card in the deck. Her +1 ability allows you to add two additional mana during your turn by untapping a land and a mana creature. Additionally, Kiora can do some pretty cool things like untap creatures such as [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) (sadly absent from this decklist) and [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). Kiora allows you to play your most powerful cards, [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) and [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon), two turns earlierâ€”which is pretty sweet!

[Sarkhan Unbroken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Unbroken) got lots of hype when it was spoiled months ago at PAX East, but it hasn't seen much play in Standard. It's hard to argue with a five-mana planeswalker that gives you a Dragon the turn you play it, but for some reason the card never really caught on. With *Battle for Zendikar* being a slower format, Sarkhan suddenly becomes much more desirable to play.


Temur is a clan that has always struggled with removal, and as you can see from the list, the removal options are pretty light. The one removal spell in the main deck is [Draconic Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draconic+Roar). Temur hits really hard, and with [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) and [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) being huge threats that get cast early, your opponent will be in chump-blocking situations quite often. [Draconic Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draconic+Roar) not only helps clear the way, but it's also pretty good at dealing those final points of damage to the opponent.
