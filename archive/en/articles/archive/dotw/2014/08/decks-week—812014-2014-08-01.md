Modern was the forefront of last weekend for many. At [Grand Prix Boston-Worcester](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbos14), well over 2,000 players showed up with their best Modern decks to compete in the last Grand Prix of the 2013–2014 Premier Play season. In the end, it was Robin Dolar who left everyone in the dust with his WBG Midrange deck, securing him the trophy.


However, while that was going on, many players around the globe were also battling Modern as part of the PTQ season, and a few players locked up their invitation and airfare to Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*. You can take your first big step toward getting to the big event by locating a [Pro Tour Qualifier](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/qualifierlist#huey) near you.


Meanwhile, while Boston-Worcester's Modern rounds were the highlight in North America, [Grand Prix Taipei](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gptai14) gave players their first look into *Magic 2015* Limited on the premier play stage. While many big names were able to secure valuable Pro Points at the tournament, including Tzu-Ching Kuo and No. 12-ranked player Lee Shi Tian, it was hometown hero Huang Hao-Shan who took home the trophy.


For players looking for a little shift in Constructed formats, Standard will be on the main stage this weekend at  [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-pro-tour-magic-2015) . The world's top players have had a chance to test and tweak their Standard decks with the new set. Which archetypes will rise to the top, and who will secure the trophy/World Championship slots/World *Magic* Cup captaincies/Platinum Pro Club levels this weekend?
