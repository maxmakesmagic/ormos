![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2012_2.jpg)*Get your free promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).* Lyon is the third largest city in France, and is the capital of the Rhone-Alpes region. It is known as a gastronomic and historical city with a vibrant cultural scene. Believe it or not, but it is also the birthplace of cinema!


You can visit the city the best on foot or by bike. A good point is that most attractions are free. Don’t miss the view from Fourvière basilica, the streets and traboules in Vieux Lyon and get a drink on Place Sathonay. 


Attend Grand Prix Lyon, which takes place in the Cité Internationale, a unique and important urban project, where business and residence are mixed. It’s designed by the famous Italian architect Renzo Piano. Discover more about Lyon at [Wikitravel.org](http://wikitravel.org/en/Lyon). 



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

**Tournament Structure**

* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
