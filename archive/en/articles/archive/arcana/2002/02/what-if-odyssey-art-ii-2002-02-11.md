What if we always used the art that was submitted for each card? Well, things would certainly look different, and we like to think that they'd make a little less sense.

Here's how some familiar *Odyssey* cards would look if we kept the art that was submitted for them:

![Devoted Caretaker?](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/bizarro_caretaker.jpg)### [Devoted Caretaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Caretaker)

The woman in this illustration looks noble - devoted, even - but the problem is that she's so... so... green! Overall color tone is very important to card art, so accomodations were made for this art to be used on a green creature, namely [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger).

  
![Volcanis Spray?](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/bizarro_spray.jpg)### [Volcanic Spray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Spray)

Originally, this red spell was going to be called something like "Sandblast." But the art did not have enough of a "direct damage" feel to it; the nomads looked like they were walking in a high wind, not a damaging blast. So late in the process, when R&D realized they were short one white creature, they stole this art from red and [Tireless Tribe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe) was born.

  
![Ghastly Demise?](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/bizarro_demise.jpg)### [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise)

Ghastly Demise destroys a creature based on how many cards are in your graveyard, so the team wanted to show the ground rising up to kill a creature. The submitted painting was a bit too "dynamic" for a simple removal spell, so it was relocated to a more game-breaking card: [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).

  
![Luminous Guardian?](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/bizarro_guardian.jpg)### [Luminous Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminous+Guardian)

This card was concepted as a white nomad that could block more that one creature at a time "because he is fast." Think "hockey goalie," with lighting-quick defensive reflexes. The art, however, showed speed in a more track-and-field kind of way, not at all suitable for a defensive white creature. [Need for Speed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Need+for+Speed) gave the art a perfect home, however.
