**Card of the Day - vendredi 28 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Divine%20Offering)#### Divine Offering


*Legends* common.  
The original title of this card was "Divine Sacrifice," but it was changed when "sacrifice" was given an official meaning in the rules. The only cards with the word "sacrifice" in their titles are Implements of Sacrifice from *Fallen Empires* and the original base set Sacrifice.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 27 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Collapsing%20Borders)#### Collapsing Borders

Invasion rare.  
Red rarely offers opportunities to gain life, but the *Invasion* block bent that rule a little. If you are willing to diversify your mana base, Collapsing Borders, Rakavolver, and Thunderscape Master can all net you life.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 26 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zebra%20Unicorn)#### Zebra Unicorn


*Mirage* uncommon.  
The first version of this card was "Savannah Unicorn," a 2/3 for 1WG with the "Spirit Link" ability. Playtesting proved that to be quite strong, and it was adjusted to a 2/2 for 2WG.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 25 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ivory%20Tower)#### Ivory Tower


*Antiquities* uncommon.  
Life gain no good in constructed? Ivory Tower appeared in the finals of the World Championships three years in a row. Zak Dolan had one in his winning deck in 1994, and Marc Hernandez and Mark Justice finished second in '95 and '96 respectively with the Tower.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 24 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Spirit%20Link)#### Spirit Link


*Legends* uncommon.  
The character Kaja Foglio depicted in the original Spirit Link was later chosen to be the reference for Jolrael, Empress of Beasts. Jolrael played a big part in the *Mirage* block, and was made into a card in *Prophecy*.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 21 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eye%20of%20Ramos)#### Eye of Ramos


*Mercadian Masques* rare.  
On the Spanish printing sheet for *Mercadian Masques* rares, the Eye was accidentally omitted and replaced with a second Worry Beads. Players were allowed to redeem Beads for Eyes through the mail.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 20 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lava%20Zombie)#### Lava Zombie


*Planeshift* common.  
In design, Lava Zombie had haste instead of the ability to be pumped. A 4/3 haste guy for 3 mana - what a whoopin'!
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 19 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jeska,%20Warrior%20Adept)#### Jeska, Warrior Adept


*Judgment* rare.  
We just have to point out the gruesome piercing Jeska has through her bicep. Talk about painful. That gives new meaning to the term "Barbarian Ring."
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 18 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=City%20in%20a%20Bottle)#### City in a Bottle

Arabian Nights rare.  
City in a Bottle was the first "expansion hoser", meaning a card that could render every other card in the expansion useless. Two more were made - Golgothian Sylex destroyed *Antiquities* cards, and Apocalypse Chime did the same for *Homelands*.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 17 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Illusion/Reality)#### Illusion/Reality


*Apocalypse* uncommon.  
This card, as well as the other *Apocalypse* split cards, was sort of "reverse designed." The first part of the card to be created was the name, in an attempt to mirror the names of the *Invasion* split cards. After the names were determined, the actual spell abilities were designed to match.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 14 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lull)#### Lull


*Urza's Saga* common.  
The first name tried out for for cycling was "sliding," as it "slide it into the graveyard." 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 13 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Desert)#### Desert


*Arabian Nights* common.  
Desert was the first non-basic land printed as a common.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 12 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wall%20of%20Roots)#### Wall of Roots


*Mirage* common.  
There was a period in time a few years ago when it was ruled that you could use Wall of Roots ability an infinite number of times "between turns", float the mana until the next player's upkeep, and deal 20 damage with Magma Mine right way. Two card turn-2 kill. That didnâ€™t last long.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 11 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wormfang%20Newt)#### Wormfang Newt


*Judgment* common.  
The Wormfang crestures were called "misers" during playtesting.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 10 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Auramancer)#### Auramancer


*Odyssey* common.  
The Auramancer is functionally different that its predecessor, Monk Idealist, in that you "may" return an enchantment with the Auramancer, but it was mandatory with the Idealist.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 7 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Breaking%20Point)#### Breaking Point


*Judgment* rare.  
The playtest version of Breaking Point cost 4 mana, but the "punisher" cost was a whopping 10 life! It took much playtesting and arguing to eventually lower the values to 1RR and 6.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 6 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mangara's%20Equity)#### Mangara's Equity


*Mirage* uncommon.  
Several proper names in **Magic** are actually anagrams of other words. The *Mirage* team decided to poke fun at that habit by creating Mangara, which is an anagram of "anagram."
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 5 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Raging%20River)#### Raging River

Alpha rare.  
Because of rules nightmares that would arise from having multiple copies of this card in play, it has been errataed to be an Enchant World.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 4 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Phyrexian%20Marauder)#### Phyrexian Marauder


*Visions* rare.  
The Marauder was the first card printed with a mana cost of X. The only other one so far is *Stronghold*'s Shifting Wall.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 3 juin 2002**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Triassic%20Egg)#### Triassic Egg


*Legends* rare.  
This card was originally called Jurassic Egg, but the release of the movie *Jurassic Park* led the *Legends* team to rethink the name.
