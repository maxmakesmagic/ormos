Wizards of the Coast

If you're a fan of Legacy, chances are you were either at [Grand Prix New Jersey](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj14) or at least following along through the coverage. Thousands of players converged in Edison last weekend in order to play in the Legacy Constructed main event. Ultimately it was Brian Braun-Duin who took home the trophy with Jeskai Stoneblade. We've got Top 8 decklists for you from this event, as well as the massive collection of Day One's undefeated offerings.


While players sleeved up Legacy in North America, Europe was busy showing off [their love for Modern](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmad14). Immanuel Gerschenson's Temur Delver deck overcame the field, and *Khans of Tarkir* has shown its impact on the format. [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and even [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) saw serious play.


Meanwhile, PTQs continue in the final weeks of the  [Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/event-information-pro-tour-fate-reforged)  qualification season. There's still time to join us in Washington, DC, February 6â€“8, 2015, so [be sure to find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) and win your invitation and airfare to the Pro Tour!
