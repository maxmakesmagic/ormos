Today's card is the *Judgment* poster boy, [Erhnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn). Greg Staples got the honor of redoing this icon (Ernie debuted in *Arabian Nights*). We knew the new Erhnam illustration would be used a lot in *Judgment* ads, so he had to look particularly bad-ass.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This is a green card and should show the Erhnam Djinn in a dramatic pose. See reference." Pretty simple. The reference, one would assume, was the [erhnam djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=erhnam%2Bdjinn).

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Greg. Looks good, except Ernie is missing his trademark ponytail.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. The ponytail has been added, and Ernie looks rough and grizzled as any long-time veteran should.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it will appear in the *Judgment* expansion.
