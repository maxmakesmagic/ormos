2001 Amateur Championship Coverage
==================================












2001 Amateur Championship Coverage
----------------------------------


![Amateur Championship](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/tournaments/images/AmChamps_sm.gif)After nine rounds of swiss, the metagame statement presented by Amateur Championships was loud and clear: permission decks rule. The Top 8 contained seven blue-based permission decks, creating a bold statement for observers who were interested to see what the post-Apocalypse Standard environment would look like. In the end, Tim Bonneville took the 2001 Amateur Championship with a black/blue/red deck designed to have an edge against other permission decks. This allowed him to breeze through the Top 8, and win Magic for life.
