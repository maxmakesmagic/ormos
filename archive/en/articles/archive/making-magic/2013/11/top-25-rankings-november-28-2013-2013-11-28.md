It has been another big week for movement in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings, so let's dive in! First, a new entry. Just in time for Grand Prix Toronto this weekend, Canada has a second ranked player. Joining No. 25 Jon Stern is [Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*](/en/events/coverage/ptars12) champion Alexander Hayne. He enters the chart at No. 21, thanks to his outstanding victory in team play at [Grand Prix Kyoto](/en/events/coverage/triple-h-conquers-kyoto) last weekend. Joined by [Pro Tour Geneva](/en/events/coverage/ptgene07) champion Mike Hron and Limited standout Rich Hoaen, the "Triple H" teammates dominated the weekend and were worthy winners in a tournament stacked with super-teams. 

 Meanwhile, at [Grand Prix Albuquerque](/en/events/coverage/gpabq13), Owen Turtenwald was creating a bit of **Magic** history, by winning back-to-back Grand Prix. His victory moves him from No. 16 to No. 12, with a Top 10 berth well within his sights. He'll be at GP Toronto this weekend, looking to complete an unprecedented "three-peat," an achievement that would be all the more astonishing thanks to the fact that it would come in three completely separate formats. 

 In terms of movement, the next standout is Paul Rietzl, who converted his Top 8 finish in Albuquerque into a rise of three places to No. 17. However, as regular rankings readers will recognize, one of our prime storylines has been the emergence of Sam Black as a truly dominant force. Yet again, Black made the Top 8, in Albuquerque, putting him on a four-for-four Top 8 tear, something that essentially *never* happens. Now up to No. 7, Black is within a single point of the Japanese pair Yuuya Watanabe and Shuhei Nakamura. 

Next, it's a double-header weekend. Can Owen create history in Toronto? Can Hayne and Stern assert home-field advantage for the Canadians? And, over in Europe, at GP Vienna, can Shahar Shenhar assemble a Top 8 run that could see him take over as the No. 1-ranked player heading into the holiday season? Join us next week for all the answers.
