**Tell us what color combination you want to draft in Odyssey, and why.**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Ryouma Shiozu**: Red, for the removal. If not red, then blue. I personally have trouble playing green, and I always seem to lose with a green-red deck. | **Tsuyoshi Douyama**: Blue-white. I like to play blue anyway, and it lets me avoid fighting people over green. | **Toshiharu Niwa**: Green-blue, for the fatties and bounce. |

**What do you think is the strongest Odyssey card in Limited?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Masahiko Morita:** Aboshan, Cephalid Emperor | **Masayuki Higashino:** Overrun | **Jin Okamoto:** Overrun |

**What is your first impression of Odyssey Block Limited?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Masaya Mori:** {expletive deleted} | **Koichiro Maki:** It's basically all luck. People will start talking about theory and technique, but in the end, I think it's about the cards you open. | **Itaru Ishida:** Sealed luck. |

**What card do you want to open in an Odyssey draft?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Ken'ichi Fujita**: There's no stopping Rabid Elephant. | **Katsuhiro Mori**: Probably Wild Mongrel. | **Olivier Ruel**: Hard to say, but I like Aven Windreader. |

**What Odyssey cards do you think will make a big impression in Constructed play?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Alex Shvartsman**: Finkel (Shadowmage Infiltrator) | **Kiyoshi Sasanuma**: Finkel (Shadowmage Infiltrator) | **Tsuyoshi Fujita**: My three picks: the filter lands, Wild Mongrel, or Call of the Herd. |
