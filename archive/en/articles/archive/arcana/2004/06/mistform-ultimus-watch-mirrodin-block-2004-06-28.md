| *[Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) -- if there's a race, occupation or long-hyphenated-descriptor, the Ultimus is it!* |

Welcome to the first **[Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) Watch**. In this to-be-recurring sub-feature of Magic Arcana, we keep track of what creature types that auto-updating *Legions* legend has recently become, and in effect, what new creature types have recently been added to **Magic**.


But since this is the first occasion of [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) Watch, you may want to do a little background reading on Mr. Ultimus.


* Want to read Aaron Forsythe's [development stories](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/af5) from when [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) was being created?
* Want to read all of Rune Horvik's [rulings](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/satschoolarchive&term=mistform_ultimus) about the Ultimus?
* Want to read Jay Moldenhauer-Salazar's [deck ideas](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/jm54) for [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus)?
* Want to read [player-submitted poetry and stories](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/af12) about the day the Ultimus became Human?

Okay, enough with the old; you're ready for the new. Today we focus on what the Ultimus has become as the result of *Mirrodin* block: the *Mirrodin*, *Darksteel* and *Fifth Dawn* sets.


* *Mirrodin* adds **Archer** with [Tel-Jilad Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Archers). It adds **Drone** with cards like [Looming Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Hoverguard). It adds the high-profile **Human** with eleven cards like [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault). The **[Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Alpha%2BMyr)** creature type of course also busts onto the scene as of *Mirrodin*. Also new are **Rogue** from cards like [Neurok Spy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) and **Shaman** from cards like [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman). The creature types **Pentavite** and **Pest** arrive due to the token creature generators [Pentavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus) and [Nuisance Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine). **Slith** shows up on cards like [Slith Bloodletter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Bloodletter). Lastly, *Mirrodin* adds **Vedalken** from cards like [Vedalken Archmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Archmage).
* *Darksteel* adds **Artificer** with cards like [Slobad, Goblin Tinkerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slobad%2C+Goblin+Tinkerer). It adds **Blinkmoth** from [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) and **Twin** from [Gemini Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemini+Engine). Lastly, *Darksteel* brings us **Wirefly** from [Wirefly Hive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirefly+Hive).
* *Fifth Dawn* adds **Bringer** to the Ultimus's virtual type line with cards like [Bringer of the White Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bringer+of+the+White+Dawn), and **Pincher** due to [Summoning Station](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Station).

That's all for this block. The next time we'll catch up with [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) Watch is in October, after the release of *Champions of Kamigawa*!


To summarize, as of the release of *Fifth Dawn*, [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is a:
