The Players


One of the smilingest men in *Magic*, Ken Yukuhiro made a big splash with his semifinals appearance at Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*, and put up four Grand Prix Top 8's in 2013, including a win at Singapore. This weekend he's come armed with a further refinement of the Rock with White deck, adding the power of [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) and spot removal in the form of [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile).


This round he squares off against Japan's Dandy in Chief, Katsuhiro Mori. He may have lost a step since his heyday as World Champion in 2005, but he has remained dedicated to playing the game at the top levels, and is a fixture on the Japanese GP scene. His deck this weekend earned a lot of puzzled looks. It's a blue-red combo deck, but in this case the storm is [Possibility Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possibility+Storm). The key combo is getting a Storm into play, then casting the deck's one [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) (tutored up by transmuting [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West), usually) and then hitting the deck's only other creature, [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn). [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) provides a backup solution.

Both players managed to sneak into Day 2 with the minimumm 7-2 record. However, the road to greatness runs over the bodies of enemies defeated. Only one would remain in Top 8 contention.



The Games


Yukuhiro was stalled on just two lands, and without green mana early in game one. [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) taxed Mori's hand, and he churned through his deck with all four [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). Yukuhiro finally hit his third land and bot on the board with [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). Another [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) drew out [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) the turn after, clearing the way to resolve [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).

Now Mori was on a clock. He kept [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) at bay with [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and dug further with [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice). He transmuted [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) into [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), but he still had no [Possibility Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possibility+Storm). Yukuhiro flashed back [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) to put lethal on the board. Mori flashed back [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) at end of turn, untapped, and drew. His eyes swept the board once, and then he packed up his cards.



**Yukuhiro 1 - Mori 0**


Yukuhiro sideboarded heavily, taking out his slower threats and useless removal. It looked good for him early in the second game when a first-turn [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) left Mori with nothing but lands in hand. Mori was unable to stop the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) that followed, so his deck would have to be kind.

He managed to find a [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) that served up [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). [Mirran Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) hit play for Yukuhiro, but Mori had found [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Another hit from the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) left him at twelve, and this time Yukuhiro got [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) to stick. Mori transmuted for [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) and passed with two mana open. Yukuhiro ripped [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), and his excitement was visible as he checked to make sure the way was clear, and then attacked with all his creatures. Mori nodded, taking the damage, then did a double-take. He had miscounted, and Yukuhiro had just hit him for lethal.



**Ken Yukuhiro defeats Katsuhiro Mori 2-0**
