Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The month is nearly over, so once again it's time to take a trip in our Friday Night *Magic* time machine and see what promos we have in store (and in stores!) for the coming months.


January
=======


It's a new year, which means it's time for a journey to find yourself...and maybe a few Forests. Nissa's certainly on such an introspective journey, and you can join her with your copy of Nissa's Pilgrimage with art by Christine Choi.

February
========


Would you like to pit your will against that of an Eldrazi? Apparently Jace would, in this version of Clash of Wills with new art by Anna Steinbauer.

Zada smash! Get the smashiest of artifact-destruction spells and march all over your artifact-laden opponents with this promo Smash to Smithereens with new art from Darek Zabrocki.
