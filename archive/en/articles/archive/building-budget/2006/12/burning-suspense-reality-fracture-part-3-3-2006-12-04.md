You voted, and you wanted a deck that combined the suspend and storm mechanics. Suspend allows you to engineer your turns so that multiple spells resolve at the same time, and storm takes advantage of an artificially increased spell count to pack one doozy of a spell.


I left off with a 5-5 record with the deck, which was in need of some changes. The deck wasn't consistent enough – I would have turns where my storm count was very low, or I couldn't generate enough mana. On top of that, many of my games were being won by [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories), and yet there were only two in the deck. If I'm going to use storm as my kill condition, I want to have the most storm cards possible.


The goal of a deck that revolves around storm and suspend, I've found, is to have “One Big Turn” – a turn in which all the spells you have suspended resolve and you throw as many of your eggs into one basket as possible in order to get a huge storm count for the win. Other strategies that combine these two mechanics are not taking full advantage of their synergy and are less likely to do as well because of that.


 



![Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seething+Song)

In order to fix both of these problems, I added [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) to the deck. Many decks don't want to play [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), because the one-shot additional generation of two red mana isn't always worth the price of a card. In this deck, I'm aiming for one big turn – a turn in which I cast as many spells as possible, and have as much mana available as I can with which to cast them. Because of this, [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) acts both as a storm enabler and a storm count upper.

To make room for two more Ignites and a playset of [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song)s, I cut all three [Jhoira's Timebug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira%27s+Timebug)s. I wasn't particularly impressed with their ability – they'd allow me to play suspend spells slightly earlier than I otherwise would, but they themselves wouldn't up a storm count on my critical storm turn in the same way that [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) could.


In addition, [Pardic Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Dragon) seems like a lame duck – I only got him into play once, and other times he sat in my hand while I waited to get up to six mana to hard-cast him. It's too easy for an opponent to keep him out of play nearly indefinitely, and that is not the hallmark of a good card.


As the last two cuts, I took out the random [Sage of Epityr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+Epityr) that came with the theme deck – while he could set up a big turn in theory, casting him the turn before a storm turn means that I have one less spell to cast *on* my storm turn. Lastly, I took out an [Izzet Boilerworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Boilerworks), as the deck is already a little land-heavy and I just added four cards that generate mana.


**Out**: 1 [Pardic Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Dragon), 3 [Jhoira's Timebug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira%27s+Timebug), 1 [Sage of Epityr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+Epityr), 1 [Izzet Boilerworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Boilerworks)  
**In**: 2 [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories), 4 [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song)

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Island)


















**Game 1: NAME WITHHELD (White Weenie)**


I suspend turn 1 [Keldon Halberdier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Halberdier), then use [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) on turn 2 to kill his [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions). He concedes.


*Record: Does not Count!*


I guess that he's had bad experiences with storm decks already – oh well!


**Alternate Game 1: Powerslouch (B/U/G Control)**


I get [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron) and [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate), but he uses [Clutch of the Undercity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity) on my Errant one, and then casts Ribbons of the Nights my Riftwing. I get [Keldon Halberdier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Halberdier) and a second [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron) into play shortly thereafter. He uses [Twisted Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Justice) to kill my Halberdier and draw four cards and then kills my other [Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephemeron) (not the *Exodus* one, bad autocard!) with a second [Ribbons of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ribbons+of+Night).


Well, I've had enough of that. On my next turn, I play [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) (1), [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) (2), [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) (3), [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) (4), [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) (5) and [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) (6). Powerslouch doesn't have an answer to 18 Goblin tokens, and concedes.


*Record: 1-0*


**Game 2: J\_Sub (Mono-Blue Suspend)**


He gets turn-two [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron), turn-three [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron) plus [Viscerid Deepwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Deepwalker), and turn-four [Deep-Sea Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep-Sea+Kraken). I [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) out a hardcast [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron) on turn four, only to have it get hit by [Snapback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback). J\_Sub drops [Paradox Haze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradox+Haze) and very, very quickly runs me over with his unsuspended creatures.


*Record: 1-1*


**Game 3: Catacombs6961 (Fun with Fungus)**


He gets [Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow), [Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid) Shell-Dweller, and [Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact). I drop [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows) to kill his Elf, and he responds with a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) (which I also Arrow). I suspend [Deep-Sea Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep-Sea+Kraken), and he casts [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season).


 



![Phyrexian Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Arena)

Well, his [Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid) starts getting double counters, and spitting out double Saprolings. They are followed by [Thallid Germinator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Germinator), and suddenly the world looks awfully green. I suspend [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt), and he attacks me down to eight, and drops [Phyrexian Arena](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Arena). I send [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) at his head (1), play [Whispers of the Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse) (2), and play [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) for three. His only card in hand is a second [Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact), so he takes 12 damage from the Ignite and 3 from my [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt). Catacombs6961 has also taken 4 damage from his [Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow) and pain lands, and ends my turn at one life. His [Phyrexian Arena](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Arena) finishes him off during his upkeep.

*Record: 2-1*


Well, I'm convinced – the slower suspend cards are not working very well with the storm cards. I borrow a page from other storm decks that have been floating around ([Dragonstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) and [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) variants) and add in four [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) from *Coldsnap*. I take out the two Halberdiers, the [Deep-Sea Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep-Sea+Kraken), and the [Careful Consideration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration) (which is another random one-of from the original deck).


**Out**: 2 [Keldon Halberdier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Halberdier), 1 [Deep-Sea Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep-Sea+Kraken), 1 [Careful Consideration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration)  
**In**: 4 [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame)

Memo to pauper players – at this point, the deck is down to zero rares, three timeshifted cards, seven uncommons, and fifty commons. Enjoy!


**Game 4: Battlestar\_Cerebus (Orzhov Control)**


Neither of us do much until I get a turn of [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker), [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron), [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), and [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories). His hand is three lands and a [Pillory of the Sleepless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillory+of+the+Sleepless). He then suspends [Curse of the Cabal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+the+Cabal) on his turn, frown! I battle back with [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) and [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) and chip away at his life total with Goblins. He uses [Orzhova, the Church of Deals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhova%2C+the+Church+of+Deals) to keep afloat, along with a [Guardian of the Guildpact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+of+the+Guildpact). I drop the Guardian to a 0/1 with [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows) before he destroys the artifact with [Seed Spark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seed+Spark). He drops [Venser's Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%27s+Sliver) and [Kjeldoran Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Gargoyle). I suspend [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt), then next turn Bolt the Gargoyle, swing in with my guys, and [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) him for exactly his life total.


*Record: 3-1*


**Game 5: SevenRX (Mono-Green Elephants)**


I get run over. There isn't much to say here, except that SevenRX smashes me with [Assault // Battery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+%2F%2F+Battery), [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), a [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak). I put out a bunch of Goblins via [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens), but they only serve to keep me alive a turn or so.


*Record: 3-2*


Again, I'm not happy with the mix between suspend and storm in this deck. My storm cards are winning all my games, and my suspend cards ([Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron), [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate), [Keldon Halberdier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Halberdier), [Deep-Sea Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep-Sea+Kraken)) keep dying to creature kill spells. I decide to try an alternate route: [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon).


The Gargadon can, in theory, come into play on a giant storm turn and deal a gigantic 9 damage. Let's say I have five lands in play, and it's my Storm turn. I can tap all five lands to put mana into my pool, then sacrifice them to get a five-counter-or-less Gargadon into play. This ups my storm count by one for zero mana plus puts a 9/7 haste creature on the board.


To make room for the Gargadon, I yank out the [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron)s from the deck. I also want more cards that up my storm count/mana considerations, so I add in the last couple of [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker)s to finish out a set of four and take out the [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows). On turn four/five, I want to be setting up for a big storm turn, not killing [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves).


**In**: 4 [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon), 2 [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker)  
**Out**: 4 [Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron), 2 [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows)

**Game 6: Zenon6 (U/W/G Blink/Hierarch/Glare)**


I suspend turn-one and turn-two [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon). He gets turn-one [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), turn-two [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage), and turn-three [Glare of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual). I play [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) (1), [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) (2), [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) (3) his two guys dead, and then [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) (4) for eight Goblin tokens. He drops [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch), blocks a Goblin, and takes 7. On his turn, he attacks for four. I attack, and he casts [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) to untap/retrigger his Hierarch, gaining four life and killing a Goblin in the process. He attacks again and drops [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage). I play [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning), [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) his [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) (to keep it from tapping any of my creatures via Glare) and sacrifice all of my Goblins to bring both of my [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon)s into play at once (So I used [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) on a Guildmage so he couldn't Glare a Gargadon. Say that three times fast!)


A [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) on the Hierarch is able to stop 9 damage, but Zenon6 doesn't draw another creature after a chump block and dies to my 18 power worth of creatures.


*Record: 4-2*


**Game 7: Sam De Cat ([Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio))**


He gets a bunch of mana and a bunch of guys with comes-into-play abilities, and then drops [Cloudstone Curio](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudstone+Curio). I set up an [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) for 6, but his hand is all two-drops ([Plaxmanta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plaxmanta), [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage), and the such), which only takes him down to 8. He begins recurring [Azorius Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Herald), and I concede – with no cards in hand and his ability to save any of his guys with [Plaxmanta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plaxmanta), I really have no way to pull this out before I die.


*Record: 4-3*


One card I've been very unhappy with so far is [Izzet Boilerworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Boilerworks). It stinks being stuck with a bounce land in hand when you're trying to build around one big turn, because it throws off the timing of playing suspend cards early (turns two and three), and it doesn't give you a land drop when you need that extra mana on the turn you go off. I take out the remaining three Boilerworks and add in a couple of Mountains and an Island. I also yank the sole [Whispers of the Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse) in favor of a fourth [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens).

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Island)


















**Out**: 3 [Izzet Boilerworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Boilerworks), 1 [Whispers of the Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse)  
**In**: 2 Mountain, 1 Island, 1 Empty The Warrens


**Game 8: Lobbut (U/G/B)**


I get stuck with three Islands and a [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate) as my only playable card, and I lose.


*Record: 4-4*


It's about this time that I take a look at my deck and realize that the deck clocks in at around eight tickets worth of cards, and six of those are the playset of [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon)s. [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) would probably be a big help to the deck, but would it run the deck over budget? I set out to the Buyer/Seller message boards on ***Magic** Online* to find out the current going rates on [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom).


Three tickets.


Wow.


All right, I was expecting [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) to be selling for six to eight tickets each, but they were under half of that cost! For a measly twelve tickets, a playset of [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) could be mine. Since this deck was at eight tickets worth of cards, adding in twelve tickets was a no-brainer.


Since [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) was only three tickets each, I decided to check out the price of [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision).


Three tickets.


Double Wow.


You know, the prices on those two cards was much, much higher when *Time Spiral* first came out and I began writing this series. This is part of why I like to wait a couple of weeks before using the newest set for this column – prices are inflated on singles the first two weeks of release, as demand far, far outweighs supply. As people draft and cards enter circulation rapidly, prices fall.


Or, in other words, twenty-four tickets for four [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) and four [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom).


Seriously. No-Brainer here.


**In**: 4 [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), 4 [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom)


To make room for the eight new suspend cards, I take out seven of the older ones (4 [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon), to keep the deck on budget and 3 [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate)), plus an [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories).


**Out**: 3 [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate), 1 [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories), 4 [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon)

The new version of this deck comes in at around 28 tickets, and that's generously putting the 52 commons and uncommons in this deck at four tickets (if you shop frugally, and have patience, and post that you are buying [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom)s and [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s in the Buying room instead of searching them out in the selling room, you can easily pick them up within a day or two at two tickets each, knocking the cost of this deck down to an anemic 20 tickets).


**Game 9: Slaver001 (W/R [Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll))**


He drops [Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll) on turn five, and enchants it with [Spirit Loop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop) on turn six. I hit him with [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt), [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) with five copies, and [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) with 6. He has 3 cards in hand – a [Serra Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avenger), a [Browbeat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Browbeat), and Mountain. He reveals the Mountain four times, the [Browbeat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Browbeat) twice and the [Serra Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avenger) once, and ends up at 3 life. I run out of gas, and he drops [Serra Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avenger) and [Basalt Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basalt+Gargoyle) the following turn. I don't draw another burn spell before he kills me with his Doll (gaining 2 life a turn) and his flyers.


*Record: 4-5*


**Game 10: Malaki\_Rith (W/U/R Weenie)**


He gets his weenies in play, and puts [Undying Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Rage) on one of them. I get [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) plus four Goblins. He [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)s, and I trade the Stoker for his 4/3 attacker. He drops [Drifter il-Dal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifter+il-Dal) and puts the [Undying Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Rage) on it, and I kill his 4/3 with a [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt). I cast a pair of [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame), and [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) for four, hitting him all four times with [Undying Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Rage). This brings him to 1, and I kill him the following turn with a third [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt).


*Record: 5-5*


**Game 11: \_Clarity\_ (U/G Creatures)** 


\_Clarity\_ gets [Plaxcaster Frogling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plaxcaster+Frogling), puts a counter on [Plaxmanta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plaxmanta) and [Trygon Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trygon+Predator) with it, and starts attacking. I kill the Frogling with [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning), cast several [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame)s and [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song)s, drop [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker), and Ignite for six, doing 12 damage (off of two-drops in \_Clarity\_'s hand). When \_Clarity\_ blocks with [Trygon Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trygon+Predator), I use [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) to remove the +1/+1 counter it has, making it a 2/3 and allowing my [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) to kill it.


\_Clarity\_ [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), allowing me to [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)[Plaxmanta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plaxmanta) for three. [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) brings the game to a 5-point margin, forcing Clarity to tap two painlands to drop blockers. This allows me to get through [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) for the win.


*Record: 6-5*


**Game 12: Cwampthing (B/G Control)**


I suspend [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) on turn one, and he drops [Hissing Miasma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hissing+Miasma) on turn three. I suspend [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) on turn three. On my turn four, I unsuspend [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) (1), [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) (2), play [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) (3), [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) (4), [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) (5), [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) (6) and [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) (7). He concedes in response to the Ignite.


*Record: 7-5*


 



![Shambling Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shambling+Shell)

**Game 13: Blazing\_Archon (B/G Dredge)**
I get turn-one [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), turn-four [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) (2), [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) (3), [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) (4), [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) (5), [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) (6), and [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) for fourteen Goblins. With Blazing\_Archon out, at 9 life…he casts [Crime // Punishment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crime+%2F%2F+Punishment) for zero, taking out my entire board aside from [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker). He then drops [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell), kills my [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker), and bashes my face in with Golgari creatures.


My Crime? Going nuts with storm. My punishment? A game loss.


*Record: 7-6*


**Game 14: jypsum1 (B/G [Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination)/Husk)**


He gets turn-two [Rakdos Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Guildmage), turn-three [Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination), and turn-four [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk). I suspend [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) on turn-four, then [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) and [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) turn two and [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) turn four. My fifth turn consists of [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) (1), [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) (2), [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) (3), [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) (hardcast; 4), and [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) (5). He's at 14 before the Ignite resolves, and it hits a bunch of four-drop cards, including [Hellhole Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellhole+Rats) and [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return).


*Record: 8-6*


See the above game? If I had [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) instead of [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker), I would have been able to resolve another [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), allowing me to add one more spell to the storm count ([Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) plus Vision, versus [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker)), plus I would have drawn three more cards. I add in two [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) and take out two [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker).

I suspend [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) turn one, [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) turn two, and *three*  [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt)s on turn four. On turn five, I Bolt him for 9, [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) 5 of his guys away, and then drop twelve Goblins. He drops [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) and [Norin the Wary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norin+the+Wary), and kills one of my guys. I attack him down to 3 and then drop [Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) on his [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) for the win.


*Record: 9-7*


**Game 16: Ariel\_ (W/U Control)**


I get turn-one [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), turn-two [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), turn-four [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt). I have only [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) in hand, and I'm afraid of Wrath, so I opt to hold out for [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories). He [Repeal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal)s the Bloom, and I replay it, draw [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) and [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories), and then have a turn of:


[Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning) (1)  
[Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) (2)  
[Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) (3)  
[Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) (4)  
[Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) (5)  
[Coal Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) (6)  
[Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) (7)  
[Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) for (8)  
[Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories) for (9)


He has two [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters), one [Repeal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal), [Draining Whelk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draining+Whelk), [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel), and [Sacred Mesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa) in hand. He's at 12 life after the [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), and so the Ignite finishes him off easily.


*Record: 10-7*


My record post–[Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) and [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)? 6-2. This deck is an absolute blast to play, and it can have the most explosive fourth or fifth turn you've ever seen. Have fun storming and suspending – next week, I return with a one-shot article I like to call “What Do You Do with Sixty-Four Mana?”
