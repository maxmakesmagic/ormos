This is not the first time that **Magic** cards have been printed in Korean. They first appeared back in the days of *Visions* and *Tempest*.

When Korean makes its triumphant return in ***Magic** 2012*, **Magic** will reach its highest number of simultaneous languages ever: English, Chinese Traditional, Chinese Simplified, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish! The ***Magic** 2012* Core Set will launch in Korean on October 14. *Innistrad* will also be in Korean a little bit later than the other languages, but *Dark Ascension* will be in Korean on February 3 along with all the other langauges. And then we'll have a simultaneous eleven-language global release from then on. It's very exciting!
