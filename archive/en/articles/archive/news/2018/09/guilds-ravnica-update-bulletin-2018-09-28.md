Hey.


Yeah, you. Come here.


They say knowledge is power, and I hear you're looking for some of both. House Dimir can provide what you need.


You're looking for knowledge about the rules and Oracle changes with *Commander (2018 Edition)* and *Guilds of Ravnica*? Well now, that knowledge probably won't overthrow any governments or ruin any businesses, so it won't run against the House's interests if you were to know these things. Very well, I'll provide you this information. For free, even. Consider it a favor.


I trust you'll repay that favor when we ask.


And we will ask, one day.


As usual, you'll be able to find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/). At this time, one or both of those might not be updated just yet, so I'm describing a general truth here. Keep in mind that this article was written before the rules changes were finalized in editing, so there may be minor deviations from what I describe.
