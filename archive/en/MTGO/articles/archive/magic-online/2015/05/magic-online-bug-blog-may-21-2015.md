Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
======================================



We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature. | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters. |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| General | Players can experience memory leaks in some situations. | Restarting the client can temporarily resolve these issues. |
| Collection | Certain preconstructed decks do not create decklists upon opening them. | If you are experiencing this issue with a preconstructed deck, locate the product within the [Card Set Archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive) to download the decklist directly. |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error. | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Duel Scene | Cancellation message appears if user does not return to play lobby after a duel has concluded. | When you finish playing in an event, please close the Event Details window. If this window remains open in the background, within minutes it will incorrectly display an error message indicating that the event has been canceled with your entry option returned. We are currently working on a fix for this issue. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step. | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. |
| Sideboard Issues:* Duel Scene | Black game screen after sideboarding.
* Sideboard | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when Sideboarding.
* Sideboard | User is able to visually duplicate cards in deck by rapidly dragging and dropping during Sideboarding.
 | These issues seem to be tied to the player's computer going to sleep during deckbuilding. Making it so that your computer does not go into hibernation may alleviate these issues if you're experiencing them. |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results. | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues. |
| Trade | If you open a booster pack that is in your active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade. | Logging out and then back in will correct this issue. |

**Server**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |

Known Issues List
=================



The following are a list of known issues on *Magic Online*. Our goal with the known issues list is to give players insight into what we're working on, as well as helping players avoid problematic bugs and performance issues.


Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of known issues, simply the ones that we feel players are most likely to encounter. These issues are also not sorted in any particular order, aside from their category. While the list below is not sorted by priority or projected fix date, bugs and performance issues listed as "scheduled" have a scheduled fix in the near future—this status is subject to change.
