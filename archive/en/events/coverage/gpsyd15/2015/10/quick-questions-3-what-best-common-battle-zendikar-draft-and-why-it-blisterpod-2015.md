What is the best common in *Battle for Zendikar* Draft, and why is it Blisterpod?
=================================================================================


Sometimes opinions can be divided on the best common or uncommon card in any given format, but not for *Battle for Zendikar*, this time it's absolutely obvious. I asked some of the best players here this weekend why they felt [Blisterpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blisterpod) is hands down the best card ever printed.

**Zen Takahashi:** Because Black-Green sacrifice is the best deck, according to Jason Chung, even though he's only drafted it once. The best common is probably [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner), though.

**Paul Jackson:** [Outnumber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outnumber) is second only to [Blisterpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blisterpod). [Outnumber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outnumber) is so good because it allows you to be the first person to play more than 1 spell a turn as early as turn 3. It gives you so much tempo.

**Chester Swords:** [Complete Disregard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complete+Disregard).  

(Editor: to my question? Or the card?)  

Chester: Both.

**Maitland Cameron:** Incorrect! It's [Outnumber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outnumber).

**Sam Loy:** The best common is [Clutch of Currents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Currents).

**Kelvin Chew:** Because... it's actually [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner)?
