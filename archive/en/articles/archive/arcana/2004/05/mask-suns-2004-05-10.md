Last week in [Rei Nakazawa’s storyline article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/210) we previewed the Legendary cat soldier Raksha Golden Cub.

This is actually the Mask of Suns, a Leonin battle artifact fashioned by Dakan and said to contain his strength and cunning. Though the mask didn’t end up getting its own card in *Fifth Dawn* it does find a home in this dramatic piece by Pete Venters.
