 Join the main tournament and get a cool foil [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) promo card! But the fun doesn't stop there – a side-event schedule running Friday-Sunday offers many other opportunities to win great prizes, and you can also meet **Magic** artists Mark Poole and Rob Alexander and get your cards signed. 

 Strasbourg is mainly known as the official seat of the European Parliament. This city in eastern France is quite close to the border with Germany, and easy to reach from both countries. It's the ninth-largest metropolitan area in France and hosts the largest University of France. Strasbourg's historic city centre is UNESCO World Heritage, providing a compelling site to visit should your attention turn away from **Magic**.

* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players - whichever is greater - advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players - whichever is greater - advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.

* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 matches will have no time limit.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The Regional Judge Coordinator is Alexis Rassel. Judges interested in working at this event should submit an application through the ([**Magic** judge website](http://apps.magicjudges.org) ).

* Players are responsible for bringing their own method of tracking life totals, card sleeves, and appropriate counters or tokens.
* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

(For Grand Prix Strasbourg, the cutoff date will be April 10.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:
