**There Will Be No Downtime for September 9, 2015**


During the past two weeks, we have experienced issues when returning from downtime. We are currently troubleshooting the root cause of these issues and, to avoid further negative experiences for our players, we will not be having our usual Wednesday, September 9, downtime. Because of this, **redemption will be postponed until our next downtime**.


We’ll update players with our downtime plans for September 16 via the *Magic Online* Home Scene, the Weekly Announcements for Tuesday, September 15, and on the [*Magic Online* Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline).
