**Age:** 20   
**Location:** Amsterdam   
**Occupation:** Student   
**Played Magic since:** Fallen Empires dec. 1993

**Q: What made you decide to come to Grand Prix Amsterdam?**  

A: I live in Amsterdam and I play Magic.



**Q: What were your expectations going into this tournament, and why?**  

A: I expected to drop our on day 1 because I only had 1 bye and could only afford 1 loss, because of the huge attendance.



**Q: Briefly describe your tournament play-wise so far, both day one and day two.**  

A: I've been concentrated all weekend and outplayed most of my opponents although I've had some luck in critical moments.



**Q: What do you think about the format?**  

A: I don't really like limited but in Invasion makes sealed deck much harder. It's harder to make the best possible deck.



**Q: What do you think is the main reason for you making top 8 in this tournament, and why?**  

A: I played really good.



**Q: What does this top 8 performance mean to you?**  

A: Although I've played a lot of PT's and GP's this is my first top 8 which means a big step forward!



**Q: What are your predictions for the top 8?**  

A: I expect to make it to the semis.



**Q: Anything else you'd like to share with us?**  

A: Sorry, the audience is getting impatient.
