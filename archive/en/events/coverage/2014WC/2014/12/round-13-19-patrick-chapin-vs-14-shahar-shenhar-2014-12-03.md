Two rounds to go and nineteenth-ranked Patrick Chapin needs a single win to lock up his place in the Top 4. Standing in his way is the reigning World Champion, fourteenth-ranked Shahar Shenhar.


They came to the table in a mock-argument about which of them had earned their wins.


"I gave you one!"


"You didn't give it to me. I took it. Yours was a gift though. I gift-wrapped it with a missed trigger."


They compared decklists and agreed that Shenhar's Sidisi-Whip was a favorite against Chapin's Abzan Midrange.




*Despite a rough match-up against Shahar Shenhar, Patrick Chapin was looking to overcome odds to secure his spot in the Top 4.*
