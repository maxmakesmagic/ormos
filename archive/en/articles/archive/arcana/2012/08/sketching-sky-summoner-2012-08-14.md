Let's talk Talrand.

![Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner)  
[Talrand, Sky Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner) is an important character, not to mention being a neat Legend. But forget about that for a minute, because today we're going to talk about the drakes behind him. The original sketch for Talrand naturally focused on the Sky Summoner himself:

Neat, right? But in the final version, the drakes got more detailed and developed their distinctive coloration:

Now, let's go on a tour of ***Magic** 2013*. They're the same kind of drakes you get in [Talrand's Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%27s+Invocation), unsurprisingly.

And you can also see very similar drakes on the ***Magic** 2013* Drake token card! Naturally, [Talrand, Sky Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner); [Talrand's Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%27s+Invocation); and the Drake token were all illustrated by Svetlin Velinov.
