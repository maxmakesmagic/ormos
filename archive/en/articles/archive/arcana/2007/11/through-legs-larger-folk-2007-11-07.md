The first kithkin in **Magic**, [Amrou Kithkin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Kithkin) from *Legends*, is flavored as being so short and agile that it's able to "run between the legs" of creatures much larger than it. Its *Weatherlight* homage, [Kithkin Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Armor), continued this flavor trend, granting the sneaky nimbleness of a kithkin to another creature.

This established a pattern of kithkin being unaffected by "big stuff." *Future Sight's*
[Mistmeadow Skulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistmeadow+Skulk) has a new look at that same flavor, with its protection from high converted mana costs.
