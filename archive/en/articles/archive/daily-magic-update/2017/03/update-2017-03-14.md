The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 14, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [dogs. So many dogs](#item9).


"No Changes"
============


1. A few people took on fast reactions to the Banned and Restricted announcement yesterday
* [No changes to the Banned List!](http://www.pantheonmagic.com/no-changes-to-the-banned-list/) | Pantheon Magic | Andrew Cuneo
* ["No Changes" to the Banned and Restricted List](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/no-changes-to-the-banned-restricted-list/) | ChannelFireball | Matt Sperling
* [Podcast 112: Standard No Changes, ChannelFireball Grand Prix](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/podcast-112-standard-no-changes-channel-fireball-grand-prix) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive and ChazV

There were others and there will be more, but these represent the hot takes—the quick reactions that came out before a consensus could coalesce. In fact, I'm not even sure how Sperling got his out the door so fast. Dude can *write*.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [From New Jersey to No New Bans](http://manadeprived.com/first-strike-17-new-jersey-no-new-bans/) | First Strike | Kar Yung Tom, Robert Lombardi, and Bryan Gottlieb

Robert Lombardi had a stellar [Grand Prix New Jersey](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj17) finish, so there's that. There's also "no changes" to debate, the ChannelFireball Events Grand Prix takeover, and players with family priorities learning to balance their time. It's a meaty episode.


1. [Channel PV—Modern Faeries](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-pv-modern-faeries/) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

With *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* releasing this Friday, there's a lot of Modern content coming out right now—but you'd be remiss to bypass PVDDR, perhaps the greatest Faeries players of our generation, playing his favorite deck full of fluttery 1/1s.


1. [Examining *Modern Masters 2017* Limited](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34723_Examining-Modern-Masters-2017-Limited.html) | StarCityGames.com | Matt Higgs

Oh, did we mention *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* releases this weekend? We did? Strange. Well, at any rate, Higgs takes a spin through the Limited format as well as the implications for Cube.


1. [Mastering *Modern Cube*](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/03/mastering-modern-cube/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Zach Barash

These kinds of articles fascinate me. They're only relevant for a short time—the window when *Modern Cube* is available for play—but they're wildly useful during that time. If you're enjoying the [*Modern Cube*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-modern-cube-2017-03-02) on *Magic Online*, then this is a helpful little article to navigate the ins and outs of the format.


1. [The Return of Nonsense](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-return-of-nonsense/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

This was posted juuuuuuuust after the update went live yesterday, but we could all use a bit more nonsense. LSV covers a potpourri of topics, from terrible mana and [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)s to ranking Reid Dukes to ranking the discard steps. It's LSV stream of consciousness, which we could all use a bit more of.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Visible Spectrum](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk0WR-HaBUCeMNcpLmfDZcw)

You want different? You want content you won't really find anywhere else? I present to you Visible Spectrum, a "progressive rock band" that creates *Magic*-inspired music. There's "Cathartic Reunion," about Chandra. There's the Gremlin Wedding March, and there's even an ode to *Eldritch Moon*. It's weird, it's musical, and it's great.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Vintage Super League](https://vintagesuperleague.com/) | twitch.tv/magic | 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT

Four players are on the chopping block tonight! But don't listen to me, listen to this helpful tweet. Take it away, helpful tweet!

The *Magic* community is moderately obsessed with brackets these days, and the latest is, well, it's voting on dogs. @VorthosMike (Mike Linnemann) started the bracket for dogs owned by *Magic* players, and people are voting on it. It's a thing.


It's just that the results are a bit tainted since my dog, Stella, wasn't included. She doesn't seek the spotlight, but she's about an 11 out of 10 on adorableness. Also on ability to eat the garbage.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [KADASHI6351's Grixis Improvise](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-03-13-0)

Willy Edel [is a believer](https://twitter.com/bazardebagda/status/841658444910346241), maybe you should be too?


KADASHI6351 recently went 5-0 in a Competitive Standard League with this improvising monster of a deck, punishing people with quick [Maverick Thopterist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maverick+Thopterist)s, shutting them down with cheap [Herald of Anguish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Anguish)es, bleeding them dry with [Unlicensed Disintegration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration), and poking them to death with [Servo Schematic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servo+Schematic)s.


The real star of the deck is probably [Tezzeret's Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Touch), which churns out a fast 5/5 to pressure opponents right out of the gates. And while there's only one in the deck, improvising with or attacking with a [Key to the City](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Key+to+the+City), then drawing a card when it untaps, has got to be a great feeling.


The deck is oddly resilient to artifact destruction, as its best cards aren't actually artifacts, just artifact-enabled. Considering the power packed into this deck, it seems like a real potential player in the format.
