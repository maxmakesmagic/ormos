The *Visions* card [Jamuraan Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jamuraan+Lion) is interesting not because of its play mechanics, but because of how it looks across languages. The Lion is the most famous instance of a card whose art is cropped differently in different printings—tighter on the English version, and farther back on some foreign versions, including the Korean and Japanese versions shown below. Such a difference is purely accidental; we like for the cards to look the same when possible from language to language.
