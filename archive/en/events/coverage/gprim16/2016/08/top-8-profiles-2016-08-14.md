 I don't run [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). Not sure about that.




**What's the most important card in your deck?**  

 Probably [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) ...

**Age:** 29  
**Occupation:** Card player, opening a store in Olomouc  
**Hometown:** Samotišky, Czech Republic




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  

 Top 8 Grand Prix Lille 2015, Top 8 Grand Prix Bologna 2016.




**What deck did you play and why?**  

 Bant Company. Felt like the best deck to play with my limited testing, and I like the play style.




**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**  

 Definitely some sideboard changes. Probably run some copies of [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance) and [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone) instead off [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist) and [Subjugator Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subjugator+Angel).




**What's the most important card in your deck?**  
[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), by far. But [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) definitely overperformed.

**What deck did you play and why?**  

 Bant Company. The best deck.




**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**  

 I would play [Fortified Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortified+Village) over [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista) and add a fourth [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) to the main deck.

**Age:** 26  
**Occupation:** *Magic* player  
**Hometown:** Prague, Czech Republic




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  

 I won Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* last week ...




**What deck did you play and why?**  

 Blue-Red Fevered Burn. Ivan Floch persuaded me.




**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**  

 Don't know, I was pretty happy with how the deck worked. But there is a better version for sure. Maybe add some counterspells to the sideboard like [Summary Dismissal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summary+Dismissal), [Spell Shrivel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Shrivel) for the Emrakul decks.




**What's the most important card in your deck?**  
[Fevered Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions). It just straight up wins games against a lot of decks if cast on turn three, especially on the play.
