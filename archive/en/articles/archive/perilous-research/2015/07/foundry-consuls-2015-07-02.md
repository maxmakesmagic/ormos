Foundry of the Consuls

By Jacob Van Lunen




Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Welcome to the second week of *Magic* Origins previews here on DailyMTG.com. Today's preview card is an exciting new tool that should reduce variance while encouraging players to play one or two colors.



It's hard to justify playing a *ton* of land in our decks. Sure, we want to cast exciting six-drops on cue, but we always have to worry about drawing too many lands in games where we're trading one-for-one.



Historically, this issue was addressed with lands that had abilities. It was OK to justify playing 26 lands in a relatively aggressive strategy if you could fall back on [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township) or [Kessig Wolf Run](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run).

Creature lands have fulfilled this role in Modern and Legacy since the inception of those formats.



Most recently in Standard, we had [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) to help aggressive decks continue applying pressure when they ran out of gas. [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) is a very powerful *Magic* card, but the fact that it produced colorless mana was often a large enough drawback that many players chose to exclude it from their deck.



Today's card offers a unique angle that, throughout *Magic*'s history, has usually come with a very steep cost. This card requires a full turn's mana investment, but it combines well with a lot of the cards we're already trying to play with. Let's take a look at Foundry of the Consuls.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/origins_askdf9aj2399v/en_0t1o6eIuSL.png)




Foundry of the Consuls gives us a pair of threats that, against many strategies, will represent two cards, two attacks with [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai), or other extreme hurdles. We can expect Foundry of the Consuls to be included in just about every one- or two-color deck that plays 25 or more land. The card offers a strong enough end game with a small enough downside that it's actually quite strong.



Foundry of the Consuls makes our decks less susceptible to variance. When we would otherwise have no use for our mana, or we've run out of cards, we can just use our turn to make a pair of flyers. Seems like a good deal to me.



Foundry of the Consuls also combos very nicely with [Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Banthem%5D) effects, such as [Dictate of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+Heliod) and [Spear of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod) (Who knew Heliod liked Thopters so much?). With [Dictate of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+Heliod), a Foundry of the Consuls activation is nearly a [Broodmate Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon), with a pair of Dictates it represents 10 points of flying power.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dictate+of+Heliod)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+Heliod) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spear+of+Heliod)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Broodmate+Dragon)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon)


Today's card is similar to [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) in that it offers players a great angle when they run out of gas, but it produces colorless mana. This means we'll only want to play one or two colors with it.



Let's start by building a deck that utilizes the power of Foundry of the Consuls with token production. Kytheon, Hero of Akros also works very nicely with a token generation theme and [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) will help us cast our big spells. Once we run out of gas, Foundry of the Consuls should be putting on a lot of pressure with Anthem effects.



From there, we can use the best cards for a token generation strategy that are already available in the current Standard.



Here's my take on White-Red Tokens with *Magic Origins*!

The deck should do a very good job against a field of players that are primarily playing spot-removal spells. We'll have to play around [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow), especially in post-sideboarded games, but our matchups against the decks that don't have [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) or [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) should be tremendous. The biggest problem for this deck would be Abzan strategies that play [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command).

Foundry of the Consuls also works well with [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa), especially in a monocolored strategy. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw Blue Devotion make a comeback as a more permanent based deck; with cards like [Shorecrasher Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shorecrasher+Elemental), Foundry of the Consuls, and Faerie Miscreant. Let's take a look at what a Blue Devotion deck might look like after the release of *Magic Origins*.

This deck seems very exciting, and it might be good at some point in the new rotation. It does, however, seem like this deck would suffer in a world with a lot of Esper Control or [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command). Still, the general power level and consistency are here for this to be a great deck.

Foundry of the Consuls will likely be played in most one- and two-color decks that play more than 25 lands in Standard.



The possibilities for this card are endless. One could play a dedicated Blue-Black Control strategy without [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) and simply win the game with Thopter tokens. Big Red could also be a great strategy with Foundry of the Consuls, a card that combines very well with [Purphoros, God of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge).

There's also a Thopter theme in *Magic Origins*. Cards like Pia and Kiran Nalaar and Thopter Spy Network give the card a lot of potential, depending on what other goodies there might be in the set.



One thing is for sure, Foundry of the Consuls will see a significant amount of play in Standard. The effect will likely help one- and two-color decks that were struggling to keep up with the card advantage from decks that primarily rely on spot removal.



It's hard to believe, but we're just one week away from *Magic Origins* Prerelease events. The *Magic Origins* Prerelease provides us with the earliest possible opportunity to play with the new cards. Prereleases are enjoyable casual events that encourage fun over competition. We can plan to play all day in multiple events our store runs, or drop by for a single event. Remember, we need to be sure to check with [our local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) to see if we need to preregister!



Knowledge is power!
