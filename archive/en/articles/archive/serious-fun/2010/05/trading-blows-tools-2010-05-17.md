Do you remember when you first started playing **Magic**? I'm sure you probably remember who taught you the rules, shared some cards, showed off some decks, and excitedly wrangled you into the wonderful world of slinging cardboard. I would also venture a wager that the first **Magic** product you bought was some combination of the latest set: what everyone else was happily cracking open you jumped right into as well. It's natural to want to get into the latest—it's exactly what I did with my very first purchase—but buying a few booster packs of one set won't give you the base to build a variety of decks.
