Welcome to Exploit Week! Today we're taking a look at the art by [Volkan Baga](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Volkan%20Baga%22%5d) on [Qarsi Sadist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qarsi+Sadist). As a 1B exploit creature, it's likely a card you've seen in Limited, but have you taken a close look at the art?

In the background, you might think that that is a statue of [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) but, in fact, it's the elder dragon himself, looking on as he waits for his next meal.
