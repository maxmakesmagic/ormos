Eight remain in Montreal!
=========================




More than 300 players competed on Sunday, but these eight stand above the rest.

TOP 8 COVERAGE



More than 1,300 players arrived in Montreal with the goal of hoisting the trophy at the end of the weekend. Nine grueling rounds of Sealed Deck on Saturday whittled the field down to 355 to return on Sunday and draft, and the competition heated up as players angled for a Top 8 berth.


Eight players achieved that dream, including three of the four undefeated players from Day 1. Robert Lombardi, Hunter Cochran, Hugo Demers, Philippe Gareau, Michael Ferneyhough, Felix Tse, Jamie Madill and Morgan McLaughlin are the last mages standing, and the one draft remains to decide the winner here at Grand Prix Montreal.

DAY 2 COVERAGE



It’s another bright morning here in Canada, but an *Eldritch Moon* looms over it all. Four players — Felix Tse, Philippe Gareau, John Severin and Jamie Madill — finished Day 1 without a loss, and they’ll be the leaders as players draft *Eldritch Moon* with their eyes on the Top 8.


1,300 players began the tournament, but just 355 have returned on Sunday for the draft rounds in *Magic’s* newest set’s premier play debut. As players navigate the shocking developments on the plane of Innistrad several well-known players sit right behind the leaders, ready to strike. Richard Hoaen, Alex Majlaton and Gerald Fabiano all lurk at 8-1, as does Grand Prix Toronto champion Robert Lombardi. Will they make a run, or will the undefeated players continue their dominance?


Stay tuned to Grand Prix Montreal to find out!

When we entered Grand Prix Montreal one of three Grand Prix events this weekend we knew a few things would be on the line across the world. Some of those things have already been decided, most...








DAY 1 COVERAGE



1,300 players arrived in Montreal with dreams of shooting the moon, but only four players pulled off the trick. Felix Tse, Philippe Gareau, John Severin and Jamie Madill lead the way after nine rounds of *Eldritch Moon’s* Grand Prix debut, and will enter Sunday with the best shot at the Top 8.


As several of the big names fell off, it was a day of surprise runs and impressive streaks, as two of the undefeated players will also be making their first Day 2 appearance. But while the top of the standings is a collection of fresh faces, there are several known threats lurk just below the top. Richard Hoaen, Alex Majlaton and Gerald Fabiano all lurk at 8-1, as does Grand Prix Toronto champion Robert Lombardi.


More than 300 players will return on Sunday to show off their *Eldritch Moon* drafting skills as they try to complete a Top 8 run.
