* Deck lists are required
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.

* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

Grand Prix tournament byes can be earned either through a player's yearly [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/Information) total or by winning a [Grand Prix Trial](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-trials-event-types-events).


Byes earned through Planeswalker Points are calculated using the Planeswalker Point totals from all reported events as of the Tuesday immediately before the Grand Prix. Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix.

Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds.
