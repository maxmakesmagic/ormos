MrBeast Takes on *MTG Arena*
============================


FNM at Home is getting *beastly* on Friday, April 23, between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. noon PT. YouTube celeb MrBeast will be playing in *MTG Arena*! You could score one of two $25,000 prizes. This week's format uses preconstructed decks so anyone can jump in and play. [Check out the announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/mrbeast) for all the details.


Where the Rare Things Are
=========================


As we talked about in the [March 31 *MTG Arena* announcements](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-announcements-march-31-2021), when you open *Strixhaven* Store Packs and Limited Packs, you also get a Mystical Archive card. This replaces a common in the pack, but it will usually appear in the top center spot of the array of newly opened cards.


It is important to note that the Mystical Archive card does *not* replace the rare or mythic rare by appearing in that spot; the *Strixhaven* rare or mythic rare that normally comes in a pack is just bumped to a different spot in the card array. You'll always get a *Strixhaven* rare or mythic rare in every pack (unless your collection already has four copies of all the cards in one of those rarities).


Missing Store Purchases Replaced
================================


A small number of players did not receive their store purchases or rewards when *Strixhaven: School of Mages* released on Thursday, April 15. Affected players can expect these to be granted to their accounts by the end of this week.


If you were affected by this and have not received the grant by then, please [contact Customer Service](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).


Bug Fixes
=========


A few bugs were squashed with the update deployed on Monday, April 19. These included:


* The sideboard is viewable when appropriate in Best-of-One matches.
* The rewards bar and social button on the Home scene are now visible, even if you have no pending quests. If it is not appearing on your iOS device, change the scene by clicking Profile, Decks, Packs, Store, or Mastery buttons at the top, and it will reappear.
* *Strixhaven* college sleeves are no longer appearing as the backs of *Magic* cards.

To help players impacted by the issue with store purchases and other bugs, you can use the code "RestorativeBurst" to gain two Mastery levels instantly.

Thanks for your patience and feedback as we fixed these issues.
