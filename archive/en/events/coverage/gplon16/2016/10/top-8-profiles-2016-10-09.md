Former three-time national champion of Wales, by default.


****What was the best card in your sealed deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your record?****


I played red-green to an 8-1 finish. Although [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) and [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance) were great, [Bomat Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier) was the MVP.


****What was the best card in your first draft deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your record?****


The Dwarf lord [Depala, Pilot Exemplar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Depala%2C+Pilot+Exemplar) was very good in my red-white deck.


****What was the best card in your second draft deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your record?****


I drafted a mediocre red-white deck and put in [Giant Spectacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spectacle). It did the business.
