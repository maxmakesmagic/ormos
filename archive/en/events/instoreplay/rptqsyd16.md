General Information
-------------------



* [Tournament Structure](#tabs-1)
* [Format](#tabs-2)
* [Tournament Length And Advancement](#tabs-3)
* [Playoff](#tabs-4)
* [Entry Fee](#tabs-5)

The structure for Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers is modified Swiss-style. If the tournament has 129 or more players, the Top 8 at the end of Swiss earn invitations and airfare to Pro Tour Sydney 2016.


If the tournament has 128 or fewer players, then top finishing players after the Swiss rounds play in one single-elimination playoff match to determine a Top 4.




* *Shadows over Innistrad* Sealed Deck.
* 6 *Shadows over Innistrad* booster packs per player will be used.
* Decklists are required.
* If the tournament has 128 or fewer players, the playoff will consist of a *Shadows over Innistrad* booster draft with 3 *Shadows over Innistrad* booster packs per player.


* Swiss rounds will be 50 minutes in length.
* Single-elimination playoff matches will have no time limit.
* Number of Swiss rounds based on attendance according to the following chart:



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attendance** | **Swiss rounds** | **Playoff** |
| 8 | 3 Rounds (Single-Elimination only, No Swiss) | None |
| 9 - 16 | 4 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 17 - 32 | 5 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 33 - 64 | 6 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 65 - 128 | 7 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 129 - 226 | 8 Rounds | None\* |
| 227 - 409 | 9 Rounds | None\* |

* Playoff matches will be single-elimination.
* While there are no time limits in the playoff rounds, players are expected to play at a reasonable pace and finish their matches within 60 minutes.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the player who finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
* The players in the playoff will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The playoff bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* The [*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) and the [*Magic: The Gathering* Infraction Procedure Guide](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide) are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this Fact Sheet.
