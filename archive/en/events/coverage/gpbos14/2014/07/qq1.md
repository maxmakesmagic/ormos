**Who would you most like to see elected to the Magic Hall of Fame this year?**




![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Craig_WescoeQQ.jpg)
***Craig Wescoe, Pro Tour Dragon's Maze Champion**: Paul Rietzl, because I think he embodies the qualities that make a Hall of Famer beyond play skill.*

***Joel Larsson, Pro Tour Gatecrash Finalist**: Makihito Mihara. He's incredible, but nobody knows him because he never speaks.* 









![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Stanislav_CifkaQQ.jpg)
***Stanislav Cifka, Pro Tour Return To Ravnica Champion**: Guillaume Wafo-Tapa. He's just an insane player.*

***Martin Juza, Two-Time Pro Tour Top 8'er**: Am I supposed to say me? That's not going to happen. Let's go with Marijn Lybaert, because he's my friend.*

***Frank Karsten, Hall of Famer**: Shouta Yasooka. I think he is the greatest player right now in terms of pure skill.*

***David Sharfman, Pro Tour Nagoya 2011 Champion**: I think Mihara's a lock, but the player I most want to see get in is Rietzl.*
