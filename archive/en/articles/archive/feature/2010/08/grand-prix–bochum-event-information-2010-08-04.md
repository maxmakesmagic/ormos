**Steven Belledin**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpboch10/artist_belledin.jpg)Steven Belledin was raised in Pennsylvania and started his career completing high school art assignments for his older sisters in exchange for enough money to buy more candy than he probably should have eaten. After high school he fled to New York City to become an oil painter. Four years later, he stumbled out of the gates of Brooklyn's Pratt Institute into the harsh light of the "real world" and immediately dove head first into the brick wall of illustration. Though it took him a couple years to recover, he finally began plying his trade in 2000 and continues to plod ahead, tickled that he gets paid to do something he loves. Steven currently resides in Queens, New York, peering out at the world through a window he finally owns. One wife, no pets.


He has provided the artwork for over 60 **Magic**  cards, including [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), [Transcendent Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transcendent+Master), [Overwhelming Stampede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Stampede+) , and [Armament Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armament+Master).
