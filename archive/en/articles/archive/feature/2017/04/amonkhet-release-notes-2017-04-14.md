The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

*Masterpiece Series:* *Amonkhet Invocations*
--------------------------------------------


When God-Pharaoh Bolas departed Amonkhet, he left behind five gods to steward the plane until his fateful return. Physically exemplary and magically unparalleled, these gods are whom the citizens of Naktamun beseech in their time of need. With the *Amonkhet Invocations*, you can bring their might to your battles, casting age-old spells of awesome power!


* There are 54 cards in the *Amonkhet Invocations* set. The first 30 of these cards appear in *Amonkhet* booster packs. The remaining 24 cards will appear in *Hour of Devastation* booster packs. *Amonkhet Invocations* cards have their own expansion symbol.
* *Amonkhet Invocations* cards appearing in booster packs are playable in any Limited event using those booster packs. In a Sealed Deck tournament, those cards are part of your card pool. In a Booster Draft tournament, you must draft those cards for them to be included in your card pool.
* However, *Amonkhet Invocations* cards are not legal in any Constructed format the cards weren't legal in before. Appearing in *Amonkhet* or *Hour of Devastation* booster packs does not make them legal in Standard.
* Premium foil English *Amonkhet Invocations* cards appear in booster packs of all languages.
* *Amonkhet Invocations* cards are extremely rare. If you happen to open one, consider yourself quite fortunate!



---

*Amonkhet* Story Spotlight Cards
--------------------------------


There are many important moments in the *Amonkhet* story, but the five most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. You can read more about these events in the official *Magic* Story at [mtgstory.com](http://www.mtgstory.com/).


Story spotlight 1: Renewed Faith  

Story spotlight 2: Cruel Reality  

Story spotlight 3: Anointed Procession  

Story spotlight 4: By Force  

Story spotlight 5: Gideon's Intervention


The story spotlight cards in this set feature a Planeswalker symbol icon in their text boxes. The icon has no effect on gameplay. The printed cards also include the mtgstory.com URL and a number indicating the sequence of the cards in the story.




---

New Keyword Ability: Embalm
---------------------------


The God-Pharaoh has ensured that death on Amonkhet doesn't stop you from serving him. The new embalm ability allows the dead to continue serving you as mummies.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_LZCbF6fpE2.png)


Sacred Cat  

W  

Creature — Cat  

1/1  

Lifelink  

Embalm W *(W, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a white Zombie Cat with no mana cost. Embalm only as a sorcery.)*


The official rules for embalm are as follows:


702.127. Embalm


702.127a Embalm is an activated ability that functions while the card with embalm is in a graveyard. "Embalm [cost]" means "[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of this card, except it's white, it has no mana cost, and it's a Zombie in addition to its other types. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery."


702.127b A token is "embalmed" if it's created by a resolving embalm ability.


* For each card with embalm, a corresponding game play supplement token can be found in some *Amonkhet* booster packs. These supplements are not required to play with cards with embalm; you can use the same items to represent an embalmed token as you would any other token.
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original card and nothing else. It doesn't copy any information about the object the card was before it was put into your graveyard.
* The token is a Zombie in addition to its other types and is white instead of its other colors. It has no mana cost, and thus its converted mana cost is 0. These are copiable values of the token that other effects may copy.
* If the card copied by the token had any "when [this permanent] enters the battlefield" abilities, then the token also has those abilities and will trigger them when it's created. Similarly, any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities that the token has copied will also work.



---

New Keyword Action: Exert
-------------------------


To stand apart from other initiates and seize the glory before them, Amonkhet's hardiest warriors simply try harder. To reflect this fighting spirit, some creatures have an ability that lets you exert them as they attack.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_0CJxAhwpiU.png)


Glory-Bound Initiate  

1W  

Creature — Human Warrior  

3/1  

You may exert Glory-Bound Initiate as it attacks. When you do, it gets +1/+3 and gains lifelink until end of turn. *(An exerted creature won't untap during your next untap step.)*


The official rules for exert are as follows:


701.37. Exert


701.37a To exert a permanent, you choose to have it not untap during your next untap step.


701.37b A permanent can be exerted even if it's not tapped or has already been exerted in a turn. If you exert a permanent more than once before your next untap step, each effect causing it not to untap expires during the same untap step.


701.37c An object that isn't on the battlefield can't be exerted.


* All cards in the *Amonkhet* set that let you exert a creature let you do so as you declare it as an attacking creature. You can't do so later in combat, and creatures put onto the battlefield attacking can't be exerted. Any abilities that trigger on exerting an attacking creature will resolve before blockers are declared.
* If a creature has a targeted triggered ability that triggers when you exert it, you can exert it even if there isn't a legal target for that triggered ability.
* Some cards have abilities that trigger whenever you exert any creature. These abilities trigger when you exert that creature or any other creature you control.
* You can't exert a creature unless an effect allows you to do so. Similar effects that "tap and freeze" a creature (such as that of Decision Paralysis) don't exert that creature.
* If an exerted creature is already untapped during your next untap step (most likely because it had vigilance or an effect untapped it), exert's effect preventing it from untapping expires without having done anything.
* If you gain control of another player's creature until end of turn and exert it, it will untap during that player's untap step.



---

New Mechanic: Aftermath Split Cards
-----------------------------------


Cards with aftermath are split cards with a new twist. Start with the top half that you can cast from your hand like normal. Follow up with the bottom half that you can cast only from your graveyard. You don't have to cast both halves on the same turn, but doing so will frequently be awesome.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_ruO9016cNL.png)


Destined  

1B  

Instant  

Target creature gets +1/+0 and gains indestructible until end of turn.


///


Lead  

3G  

Sorcery  

Aftermath *(Cast this spell only from your graveyard. Then exile it.)*  

All creatures able to block target creature this turn do so.


The official rules for aftermath are as follows:


702.126. Aftermath


702.126a Aftermath is an ability found on some split cards (see rule 708, "Split Cards"). It represents three static abilities. "Aftermath" means "You may cast this half of this split card from your graveyard," "This half of this split card can't be cast from any zone other than a graveyard," and "If this spell was cast from a graveyard, exile it instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack."


* Split cards with aftermath have a new frame treatment—the half you can cast from your hand is oriented the same as other cards you'd cast from your hand, while the half you can cast from your graveyard is a traditional split card half. This frame treatment is for your convenience and has no rules significance.
* All split cards have two card faces on a single card, and you put a split card onto the stack with only the half you're casting. The characteristics of the half of the card you didn't cast are ignored while the spell is on the stack. For example, if an effect prevents you from casting green spells, you can cast Destined.
* Each split card is a single card. For example, if you discard one, you've discarded one card, not two. If an effect counts the number of instant and sorcery cards in your graveyard, Destined /// Lead counts once, not twice.
* Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs you to choose a card name, you may choose one, but not both.
* While not on the stack, the characteristics of a split card are the combination of its two halves. For example, Destined /// Lead is a green and black card, it is both an instant card and a sorcery card, and its converted mana cost is 6. This means that if an effect allows you to cast a card with converted mana cost 2 from your hand, you can't cast Destined. This is a change from the previous rules for split cards.
* If you cast the first half of a split card with aftermath during your turn, you'll have priority immediately after it resolves. You can cast the half with aftermath from your graveyard before any player can take any other action if it's legal for you to do so.
* If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from any zone other than a graveyard, you can't cast the half with aftermath.
* If another effect allows you to cast a split card with aftermath from a graveyard, you may cast either half. If you cast the half that has aftermath, you'll exile the card if it would leave the stack.
* A spell with aftermath cast from a graveyard will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, it's countered, or it leaves the stack in some other way.



---

Returning Keyword Ability: Cycling
----------------------------------


Ask initiates on Amonkhet about being ready for battle, and they'll say you need the right weapon at the right time. *Magic* games are no different. You need the right card at the right time, and cycling is an activated ability that can help you a lot.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_WgkilyufGv.png)


Deem Worthy  

4R  

Instant  

Deem Worthy deals 7 damage to target creature.  

Cycling 3R *(3R, Discard this card: Draw a card.)*  

When you cycle Deem Worthy, you may have it deal 2 damage to target creature.


* Some cards with cycling have an ability that triggers when you cycle them, and some cards have an ability that triggers whenever you cycle any card. These triggered abilities resolve before you draw from the cycling ability.
* Triggered abilities from cycling a card and the cycling ability itself aren't spells. Effects that interact with spells (such as that of Cancel) won't affect them.
* You can cycle a card even if it has a triggered ability from cycling that won't have a legal target. This is because the cycling ability and the triggered ability are separate. This also means that if either ability is countered (with Disallow, for example, or if the triggered ability's targets have become illegal), the other ability will still resolve.



---

Returning Theme: -1/-1 Counters
-------------------------------


While most sets feature +1/+1 counters to build creatures up, the *Amonkhet* set features -1/-1 counters to wear creatures down. Several cards in the set even reward you for putting these counters on your own creatures.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_HHaQF43eEU.png)


Channeler Initiate  

1G  

Creature — Human Druid  

3/4  

When Channeler Initiate enters the battlefield, put three -1/-1 counters on target creature you control.  

T, Remove a -1/-1 counter from Channeler Initiate: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.


* Some creatures have an enters-the-battlefield ability that has you put -1/-1 counters on "target creature you control." These abilities can target the creature itself.
* A creature with -1/-1 counters on it may have 0 or less toughness. That creature is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. This happens even if the creature has indestructible.
* A creature with -1/-1 counters on it may have 0 or less power. If so, it deals no damage in combat. If the effect of a spell or ability would change that creature's power, its actual negative power is used in the calculation. For example, a -2/2 creature that gets +3/+3 will end up as a 1/5 creature.
* If an effect of a spell or ability would do something else based on the power of a creature with 0 or less power (such as allow a player to draw that many cards), the effect will use 0 instead.
* If a permanent has at least one +1/+1 counter and at least one -1/-1 counter on it, remove as many pairs of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters from it as you can. This is done as a state-based action.
* If an effect raises a creature's toughness, -1/-1 counters on that creature may cause it to have 0 or less toughness during a player's cleanup step when that effect expires. If this happens, the creature is put into its owner's graveyard and players receive priority in that cleanup step to cast spells or activate abilities (normally, no players may take actions during a cleanup step). Another cleanup step is created following that one.
* Some effects care about which player puts counters on an object. Most spells and abilities instruct their controller to put those counters with an implied "you," such as the ability of Channeler Initiate does. For an object entering the battlefield with counters, its controller puts those counters on it.



---

Set Theme: Discard Triggers
---------------------------


Several cards in the *Amonkhet* set have abilities that care about you discarding other cards. They'll benefit you if an opponent makes you discard your cards, or if you discard them yourself.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_hT4tPwQQyW.png)


Hekma Sentinels  

2U  

Creature — Human Cleric  

2/3  

Whenever you cycle or discard a card, Hekma Sentinels gets +1/+1 until end of turn.


* An ability that triggers whenever you discard a card doesn't give you permission to discard cards. You'll need another effect that instructs or allows you to discard them.
* An ability that triggers whenever you "cycle or discard" a card triggers only once if you cycle a card. The ability "Whenever you discard a card" is functionally identical to this ability; cycling is mentioned for clarity.
* If a player discards a card during his or her cleanup step due to having too many cards in hand, any appropriate abilities that trigger on discarding that card trigger. If this happens, those triggered abilities are put onto the stack and players receive priority in that cleanup step to cast spells or activate abilities (normally, no players may take actions during a cleanup step). Another cleanup step is created following that one.



---

Set Theme: Deserts
------------------


Inhabitants of the lush, fertile city of Naktamun are protected from Amonkhet's howling dunes and marauding dead by the magic of the Hekma, while dissidents face exile and certain death.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_wTWlfELA3d.png)


Sunscorched Desert  

Land — Desert  

When Sunscorched Desert enters the battlefield, it deals 1 damage to target player.  

T: Add C to your mana pool.


* Desert is a land subtype with no special meaning. It doesn't grant the land an intrinsic mana ability. Other cards may care about which lands are Deserts.



---

Cycle: The Monuments of the Gods
--------------------------------


The horrors of the deserts are kept at bay by the barrier known as the Hekma, but also by the gods who devotedly shepherd the people of Naktamun to their final reward. With their monuments, you can get a small boon from the gods each time you cast a creature spell.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_W3Xu28Rb2H.png)


Oketra's Monument  

3  

Legendary Artifact  

White creature spells you cast cost 1 less to cast.  

Whenever you cast a creature spell, create a 1/1 white Warrior creature token with vigilance.


* Each Monument has one ability that reduces the cost of creature spells of a certain color, and a triggered ability that triggers whenever you cast any creature spell—not just a creature spell of that color.
* A creature spell that's multiple colors is each of those colors. For example, Ahn-Crop Champion is a white creature and a green creature, so it can benefit from either Oketra's Monument or Rhonas's Monument—or both at once.
* To determine the total cost of a creature spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the creature remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Each Monument's triggered ability triggers as the creature spell is cast and resolves before that creature spell resolves. The ability will resolve even if that creature spell is countered.



---

Cycle: The Trials of the Five Gods
----------------------------------


Initiates will face the five Trials that test the five aspects of worthiness: solidarity, knowledge, strength, ambition, and zeal. For each Trial passed, initiates earn a cartouche, an amulet inlaid with shimmering blue lazotep and imbued with the magic of the God-Pharaoh.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_8YuGafUIud.png)


Trial of Solidarity  

2W  

Enchantment  

When Trial of Solidarity enters the battlefield, creatures you control get +2/+1 and gain vigilance until end of turn.  

When a Cartouche enters the battlefield under your control, return Trial of Solidarity to its owner's hand.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_1onFb1U6d2.png)


Cartouche of Solidarity  

W  

Enchantment — Aura Cartouche  

Enchant creature you control  

When Cartouche of Solidarity enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 white Warrior creature token with vigilance.  

Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and has first strike.


* Cartouche is an enchantment subtype with no special meaning. Other cards may care about which enchantments are Cartouches.
* If the target creature becomes an illegal target before a Cartouche spell resolves, the spell is countered. It doesn't enter the battlefield.
* Each Cartouche is an Aura with "Enchant creature you control." If another player gains control of either the Cartouche or the enchanted creature (but not both), then the Cartouche will be enchanting an illegal permanent and be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
* Each Trial has an ability to return to your hand when a Cartouche enters the battlefield under your control. The Trial is returned to its owner's hand only if it's on the battlefield as the ability resolves.



---

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
===================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_mALATFDGXj.png)


Ahn-Crop Champion  

2GW  

Creature — Human Warrior  

4/4  

You may exert Ahn-Crop Champion as it attacks. When you do, untap all other creatures you control. *(An exerted creature won't untap during your next untap step.)*


* All attackers are chosen at once. You can't attack with Ahn-Crop Champion, untap a tapped creature, and then attack with that creature.
* Untapping an attacking creature doesn't remove it from combat.
* If you attack with two Ahn-Crop Champions and exert both, each will untap the other.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_mXn7f6ddvK.png)


Angel of Sanctions  

3WW  

Creature — Angel  

3/4  

Flying  

When Angel of Sanctions enters the battlefield, you may exile target nonland permanent an opponent controls until Angel of Sanctions leaves the battlefield.  

Embalm 5W *(5W, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a white Zombie Angel with no mana cost. Embalm only as a sorcery.)*


* If Angel of Sanctions leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Angel of Sanctions leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Angel of Sanctions's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_f5KX1Gl9dX.png)


Anointed Procession  

3W  

Enchantment  

If an effect would create one or more tokens under your control, it creates twice that many of those tokens instead.


* All of the tokens enter the battlefield simultaneously. They'll be created with the same name, color, type and subtype, abilities, power, toughness, and so on.
* If the token you create has any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities, first determine how many tokens are being created, then apply those abilities individually for each one. For example, if a token with "You may have [this permanent] enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield" would be created (such as an embalmed Vizier of Many Faces), the resulting two tokens can each copy a different creature.
* If an effect creates more than one kind of token, it'll create twice as many of each kind. For example, if you cast Bestial Menace while controlling Anointed Procession, you'll create two Snake tokens, two Wolf tokens, and two Elephant tokens.
* If you control two Anointed Processions, then the number of tokens created is four times the original number. If you control three, then the number of tokens created is eight times the original number, and so on.
* If the effect creating the tokens instructs you to do something with those tokens at a later time, like exiling them at the end of combat, you'll do that for all the tokens.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_TL4aUcZYQe.png)


Anointer Priest  

1W  

Creature — Human Cleric  

1/3  

Whenever a creature token enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life.  

Embalm 3W *(3W, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a white Zombie Human Cleric with no mana cost. Embalm only as a sorcery.)*


* If Anointer Priest is a token, most likely because it's embalmed, it will cause its own ability to trigger when it enters the battlefield.
* If Anointer Priest enters the battlefield at the same time as a creature token, its ability triggers for that other creature. For example, if you control Anointed Procession and embalm Anointer Priest, the triggered ability of each one triggers twice and you gain a total of 4 life.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_MP8K6zdsLw.png)


Approach of the Second Sun  

6W  

Sorcery  

If Approach of the Second Sun was cast from your hand and you've cast another spell named Approach of the Second Sun this game, you win the game. Otherwise, put Approach of the Second Sun into its owner's library seventh from the top and you gain 7 life.


* A card that changes zones is considered a new object, so casting the same Approach of the Second Sun card on a later turn is "another spell" named Approach of the Second Sun.
* If you have fewer than six cards in your library, you'll put Approach of the Second Sun on the bottom of your library. Otherwise, you'll lift up the top six cards without looking at them and place Approach of the Second Sun just under them.
* The second Approach of the Second Sun that you cast must be cast from your hand, but first may have been cast from anywhere.
* A copy of a spell isn't cast, so it won't count as the first nor as the second Approach of the Second Sun.
* As your second Approach of the Second Sun resolves, it checks only whether the first one was cast, not whether the first one resolved. If your first Approach of the Second Sun was countered, you'll still win the game as your second one resolves.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_bwGYG1dwQm.png)


As Foretold  

2U  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of your upkeep, put a time counter on As Foretold.  

Once each turn, you may pay 0 rather than pay the mana cost for a spell you cast with converted mana cost X or less, where X is the number of time counters on As Foretold.


* If you cast a card for an alternative cost of 0, you can't pay any other alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, you must pay those to cast the card.
* A card's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost 1UU has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
* If you're casting a split card, only the converted mana cost of the half you're casting is compared to the number of time counters on As Foretold.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it for another cost that doesn't include X. For example, if there are five time counters on As Foretold and you choose to use its effect to cast Pull from Tomorrow, X must be 0. X can't be 2, even though the spell's converted mana cost would be 4.
* If you control multiple As Foretolds, you may cast one spell for each of them paying 0.
* All counters with the same name are indistinguishable from other counters with that name. Cards from the *Time Spiral* block that interact with time counters will interact with As Foretold.

Flash  

Flying  

If an opponent would search a library, that player searches the top four cards of that library instead.


* Each search works exactly the same as normal except that the opponent doing the searching sees only the top four cards of that library. He or she can't look at the other cards in that library at all. Cards not in the top four cards of the library can't be found in the search, even if they're identifiable in some manner.
* For effects that check whether a player searched a library, searching the top four cards of that library counts as searching that library.
* If an effect uses the word "search" once but allows an opponent to search for multiple cards, the top four cards remain the same throughout the entire search. Finding one card won't cause the fifth card to be included in the search.
* After the search is complete, the entire library is shuffled.

* If Cast Out leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.

* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Cast Out leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Cast Out's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

If Combat Celebrant hasn't been exerted this turn, you may exert it as it attacks. When you do, untap all other creatures you control and after this phase, there is an additional combat phase. *(An exerted creature won't untap during your next untap step.)*


* Combat Celebrant's ability untaps all of your creatures, not just the ones that are attacking.
* Untapping an attacking creature doesn't remove it from combat.
* There's no main phase between your combat phases, so you'll have no opportunity to cast spells or activate abilities that could only be cast any time you could cast a sorcery. For example, you won't be able to cast another creature or equip Equipment between combats.
* If you exert Combat Celebrant, you get an additional combat phase even if Combat Celebrant doesn't survive the first combat phase.
* If you exert multiple Combat Celebrants in one combat phase, you'll have that many additional combat phases, but all of your creatures are untapped only during the current combat phase. You'll need to exert the Combat Celebrants one at a time, in multiple combat phases, to untap your attacking creatures and attack with them in each combat step.

Aftermath *(Cast this spell only from your graveyard. Then exile it.)*  

All creatures able to block target creature this turn do so.


* Lead doesn't give any creatures the ability to block the target creature. It just forces those creatures that are already able to block the creature to do so.
* As blockers are declared, any creature that's tapped or affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, no player is forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't block if that cost isn't paid.
* If there are multiple combat phases, creatures that blocked the creature targeted by Lead in the first combat aren't required to block it again in subsequent combats. This is because Lead's effect looks at this turn, not at each combat.

You may exert Devoted Crop-Mate as it attacks. When you do, return target creature card with converted mana cost 2 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield. *(An exerted creature won't untap during your next untap step.)*


* The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost 1UU has converted mana cost 3.
* If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes X, X is considered to be 0.
* All attackers are chosen at once. You can't attack with Devoted Crop-Mate, return a creature card to the battlefield, and then attack with that creature.

* Edifice of Authority can't be used to undo an attack or block once it has been declared. Its abilities must be activated no later than the beginning of combat step to stop a creature from attacking, and no later than the declare attackers step to stop a creature from blocking.
* Once a player has announced that he or she is activating the ability of a creature, Edifice of Authority can't be used to undo it. Its last ability must be activated before the player activates that creature's ability. The player may respond to Edifice of Authority's ability with the target creature's ability if able.
* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by the last ability of Edifice of Authority. Notably, exerting a creature isn't an activated ability.

+1: Until your next turn, prevent all damage target permanent would deal.  

0: Until end of turn, Gideon of the Trials becomes a 4/4 Human Soldier creature with indestructible that's still a planeswalker. Prevent all damage that would be dealt to him this turn.  

0: You get an emblem with "As long as you control a Gideon planeswalker, you can't lose the game and your opponents can't win the game."


* Gideon's first ability will continue to prevent damage dealt by the target permanent even if Gideon leaves the battlefield before your next turn.
* Gideon's second ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
* If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his T abilities (if he gains any).
* Gideon's second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
* If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his second ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.
* If Gideon leaves the battlefield after giving you his emblem, you'll keep the emblem. Its effect will apply again later if another Gideon comes under your control.
* No game effect can cause you to lose the game or cause any opponent to win the game while Gideon's emblem is in effect. It doesn't matter whether you have 0 or less life, you're forced to draw a card while your library is empty, you have ten or more poison counters, you're at your Glorious End, your opponent casts a second Approach of the Second Sun, or so on. You keep playing.
* Other circumstances can still cause you to lose the game. You will lose a game if you concede, if you're penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if your *Magic Online* game clock runs out of time.
* If you have Gideon's emblem in a Two-Headed Giant game and control a Gideon planeswalker, your team can't lose the game and the opposing team can't win the game. If your teammate controls a Gideon planeswalker but you do not, your emblem's effect doesn't apply.

* Gideon's second ability doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types.
* If Gideon becomes a creature the same turn he enters the battlefield, you can't attack with him or use any of his T abilities (if he gains any).
* Gideon's second ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human and Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: planeswalker is only a type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
* If damage that can't be prevented is dealt to Gideon after his second ability has resolved, that damage will have all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). Even though he has indestructible, if Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard.

Gideon's Intervention  

2WW  

Enchantment  

As Gideon's Intervention enters the battlefield, choose a card name.  

Your opponents can't cast spells with the chosen name.  

Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you and permanents you control by sources with the chosen name.


* You may choose the name of a land card. Cards with that name can still be played (since lands are never cast), but damage they would deal to you and your permanents will be prevented.
* If you choose the name of a split card, you choose one name, not both. For example, you could name Failure or Comply, but not Failure /// Comply. Opponents are still allowed to cast the half you didn't choose.
* You must choose the name of a card, not the name of a token. For example, you can't choose "Zombie" or "Ragavan." However, if a token happens to have the same name as a card (such as an embalmed creature token), you can choose it.

Glorious End  

2R  

Instant  

End the turn. *(Exile all spells and abilities on the stack, including this card. The player whose turn it is discards down to his or her maximum hand size. Damage wears off, and "this turn" and "until end of turn" effects end.)*  

At the beginning of your next end step, you lose the game.


* Ending the turn this way means the following things happen in order: 1) All spells and abilities on the stack are exiled. This includes spells and abilities that can't be countered. 2) If there are any attacking and blocking creatures, they're removed from combat. 3) State-based actions are checked. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack. 4) The current phase and/or step ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step. 5) The cleanup step happens in its entirety.
* If any triggered abilities do trigger during this process, they're put onto the stack during the cleanup step. If this happens, players will have a chance to cast spells and activate abilities, then there will be another cleanup step before the turn is over.
* Though other spells and abilities that are exiled won't get a chance to resolve, they don't count as being countered.
* Any "at the beginning of the next end step" triggered abilities won't get the chance to trigger that turn because the end step is skipped. Those abilities will trigger at the beginning of the end step of the next turn.
* If Glorious End's delayed triggered ability is countered, it won't trigger again. The same is true if it's removed from the stack in any other way (such as by a second even more Glorious End) or if it resolves and you don't lose the game (perhaps because of the emblem of Gideon of the Trials).

Greater Sandwurm can't be blocked by creatures with power 2 or less.

Grim Strider  

3B  

Creature — Horror  

6/6  

Grim Strider gets -1/-1 for each card in your hand.


* If a spell or ability causes you to draw cards and then has you remove some from hand (such as by discarding them or putting them on top of your library), Grim Strider may briefly have 0 toughness or less. As long as its toughness is 1 or greater again after the spell or ability is finished resolving, it will remain on the battlefield.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, the damage a Grim Strider takes during combat may become lethal if you draw cards later in the turn.

Whenever Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons deals combat damage to a player, you may put a -1/-1 counter on target creature.  

Whenever you put one or more -1/-1 counters on a creature, create a 1/1 green Snake creature token with deathtouch.


* If you put any number of -1/-1 counters on more than one creature at once, Hapatra's last ability triggers once for each of those creatures.
* If you put enough -1/-1 counters on Hapatra so that its toughness is 0 or less, its last ability triggers.

Harsh Mentor  

1R  

Creature — Human Cleric  

2/2  

Whenever an opponent activates an ability of an artifact, creature, or land on the battlefield, if it isn't a mana ability, Harsh Mentor deals 2 damage to that player.


* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate. Notably, exerting a creature isn't an activated ability.
* Harsh Mentor's ability doesn't trigger when an opponent activates an ability of a card in hand (such as cycling) or a card in a graveyard (such as embalm), even if that causes a card to be put onto the battlefield.
* Harsh Mentor's ability resolves before the ability that caused it to trigger.

* Once Hazoret has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if the number of cards in your hand becomes two or greater.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Hazoret's activated ability causes 2 damage to be dealt to each opponent, which is 4 damage to the opposing team.

Heart-Piercer Manticore  

2RR  

Creature — Manticore  

4/3  

When Heart-Piercer Manticore enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature. When you do, Heart-Piercer Manticore deals damage equal to that creature's power to target creature or player.  

Embalm 5R *(5R, Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a white Zombie Manticore with no mana cost. Embalm only as a sorcery.)*


* The sacrificed creature's last known existence on the battlefield is checked to determine its power.
* You can't sacrifice multiple creatures to deal damage multiple times.
* Heart-Piercer Manticore features a new style of triggered ability. When it enters the battlefield, its triggered ability goes on the stack without a target. While that ability is resolving, you may sacrifice a creature. If you do, a second ability triggers and you pick a target creature or player that will be dealt damage. This is different from other abilities that say "If you do . . ." in that players may cast spells and activate abilities before a creature is sacrificed and then again after the creature is sacrificed but before damage is dealt.
* Heart-Piercer Manticore's damage-dealing ability triggers only when you sacrifice a creature as a result of the instruction of its triggered ability. It won't trigger if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason.

Enchanted creature has base power and toughness 0/2.

///


Injury  

2R  

Sorcery  

Aftermath *(Cast this spell only from your graveyard. Then exile it.)*  

Injury deals 2 damage to target creature and 2 damage to target player.


* If a creature with trample you control would deal combat damage to a blocking creature this turn, you must assign its unmodified damage. For example, a 3/3 creature with trample blocked by a 2/2 creature can only have 1 damage assigned to the defending player. It will then deal 4 damage to the blocking creature and 2 to the defending player.
* If an effect such as that of Chandra's Pyrohelix asks you to divide damage among targets, you must divide the unmodified damage before doubling it.
* If you cast two Insults in one turn, damage dealt by sources you control this turn will be multiplied by 4. If you cast three Insults, it will be multiplied by 8, and so on. How rude.
* You can't cast Injury unless you target both a creature and a player. If one target is illegal as Injury resolves, the spell deals damage to the remaining legal target.

* If you can't choose a target opponent when you put Manticore of the Gauntlet's triggered ability on the stack (most likely because your opponents have hexproof), the ability is removed from the stack and you won't put a -1/-1 counter on any creature.

Creature — Naga Druid

T: Add to your mana pool one mana of any type that a land you control could produce.


* The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
* Any change to a land's type or abilities gained by a land can affect the types of mana a land can produce.
* Naga Vitalist checks the effects of all mana-producing abilities of lands you control, but it doesn't check their costs or legality. For example, Spire of Industry says "T, Pay 1 life: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool. Activate this ability only if you control an artifact." If you control Spire of Industry and Naga Vitalist, you can tap Naga Vitalist for any color of mana. It doesn't matter whether you control an artifact, whether you can pay 1 life, or whether Spire of Industry is untapped.
* Naga Vitalist doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as the one Cavern of Souls has. It just cares about types of mana.

−6: Untap up to two target lands you control. They become 5/5 Elemental creatures with flying and haste until end of turn. They're still lands.


* If X is 0, Nissa enters the battlefield with no loyalty and is put into her owner's graveyard before you can activate her abilities.
* While resolving Nissa's second ability, if you can't or don't put the card onto the battlefield, it remains on top of your library.
* Once Nissa's second ability begins to resolve, no player may take actions until it's done. Notably, players can't try to change Nissa's loyalty once you look at the card or choose to put it onto the battlefield.
* If Nissa leaves the battlefield while her second ability is on the stack, use her last known loyalty to determine whether you may put the top card of your library onto the battlefield. If Nissa left the battlefield because she took enough damage to reduce her loyalty to 0, then her last known loyalty is 0.
* Nissa's last ability sets the base power and toughness of the lands to 5/5. Any +1/+1 or -1/-1 counters that were on those lands will apply to those values.

T: Exile the top card of your library. Until end of turn, you may play that card without paying its mana cost. Activate this ability only if there are three or more brick counters on Oracle's Vault.


* The cards exiled by Oracle's Vault are exiled face up.
* You may play the exiled card this turn even if Oracle's Vault is no longer on the battlefield or under your control.
* Playing a card exiled with Oracle's Vault follows the normal timing rules for playing that card. For example, if the card is a creature card, you can cast that card only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* If the exiled card is a land card, you may play it only if you have an available land play this turn.
* If you don't play the card, it will remain exiled.
* The first ability of Oracle's Vault puts a brick counter on it even if you can't or don't play the card.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Tormenting Voice, those must be paid to cast the card.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

If you apply the planeswalker redirection effect and your opponent chooses to have the damage dealt to a planeswalker you control, none of that damage is prevented.

Prowling Serpopard can't be countered.

When Quarry Hauler enters the battlefield, for each kind of counter on target permanent, put another counter of that kind on it or remove one from it.

Aftermath *(Cast this spell only from your graveyard. Then exile it.)*

* In a multiplayer game, each opponent in turn order chooses a creature he or she controls, if he or she controls any creatures. After each opponent has done so, you gain control of each chosen creature simultaneously.

Soul-Scar Mage  

R  

Creature — Human Wizard  

1/2  

Prowess  

If a source you control would deal noncombat damage to a creature an opponent controls, put that many -1/-1 counters on that creature instead.


* If an effect causes a creature you control to fight a creature an opponent controls, the damage is dealt simultaneously. For instance, if your 2/2 creature fights an opponent's 4/4 creature, your creature will be dealt 4 damage and your opponent's creature will have two -1/-1 counters put on it.
* If a spell or ability an opponent controls causes a source you control to deal noncombat damage to a creature an opponent controls, that damage will be replaced with -1/-1 counters.
* Soul-Scar Mage's effect isn't a prevention effect. Damage that can't be prevented will be replaced with -1/-1 counters.
* If multiple prevention and/or replacement effects are trying to apply to the same damage, the controller of the creature that would be dealt damage chooses the order in which to apply them. As examples, an opponent could choose to apply the effect of Djeru's Resolve and prevent the damage rather than put -1/-1 counters on it; or an opponent could choose to convert the damage to -1/-1 counters before Insult could double it, and then Insult's effect won't apply anymore.

* If an effect causes Supply Caravan to enter the battlefield tapped, it will satisfy its own triggered ability.

If Thresher Lizard has been dealt 2 or 3 damage while you have zero or one card in hand, and later in the turn two cards are in your hand after a spell or ability has finished resolving, Thresher Lizard will be destroyed. Similarly, if that causes it to have 0 toughness, it's put into its owner's graveyard.

Throne of the God-Pharaoh

At the beginning of your end step, each opponent loses life equal to the number of tapped creatures you control.


* Throne of the God-Pharaoh's ability triggers at the beginning of each of your end steps, even if you control no tapped creatures. The number of tapped creatures you control is checked as the ability resolves.
* If other abilities trigger at the beginning of your end step, first those controlled by your opponents resolve, then yours resolve. Each player orders his or her triggers in any order.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, the triggered ability of Throne of the God-Pharaoh causes the opposing team to lose life equal to twice the number of tapped creatures you control. Tapped creatures your teammate controls aren't counted.

Vizier of Deferment  

2W  

Creature — Human Cleric  

2/2  

Flash  

When Vizier of Deferment enters the battlefield, you may exile target creature if it attacked or blocked this turn. Return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.


* Vizier of Deferment's triggered ability can target any creature, but it will affect a creature only if that creature was declared as an attacker or blocker this turn, whether you cast Vizier of Deferment during combat or later in the turn. Notably, the ability won't affect a creature that entered the battlefield attacking or blocking.
* After the target creature returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the creature that was exiled. It won't be in combat or have any additional abilities it may have had when it was exiled. Any counters on it or Auras attached to it are removed, and any Equipment will no longer be attached.
* A token creature exiled this way won't return to the battlefield.

Vizier of Many Faces  

2UU  

Creature — Shapeshifter Cleric  

0/0  

You may have Vizier of Many Faces enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except if Vizier of Many Faces was embalmed, the token has no mana cost, it's white, and it's a Zombie in addition to its other types.  

Embalm 3UU


* Vizier of Many Faces copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* The characteristics Vizier of Many Faces gains as part of its copy effect are copiable values that other effects may copy.
* If the chosen creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Vizier of Many Faces), then Vizier of Many Faces enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Vizier of Many Faces copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Vizier of Many Faces is not a token in this case unless it's embalmed.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Vizier of Many Faces enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Vizier of Many Faces somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Vizier of Many Faces can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.

Vizier of Remedies  

1W  

Creature — Human Cleric  

2/1  

If one or more -1/-1 counters would be put on a creature you control, that many -1/-1 counters minus one are put on it instead.


* "Put on a creature you control" includes that creature entering the battlefield with -1/-1 counters on it. If a creature would enter the battlefield with a number of -1/-1 counters on it while you control Vizier of Remedies, it enters with that many counters minus one.
* If an effect puts Vizier of Remedies onto the battlefield with one or more -1/-1 counters on it, its effect won't apply. This is because you must control Vizier of Remedies before the creature begins to enter the battlefield for its effect to apply. The same is true of any creatures entering the battlefield with -1/-1 counters on them at the same time as Vizier of Remedies enters the battlefield.
* Each additional Vizier of Remedies you control will decrease the number of -1/-1 counters put on a creature by one.

Vizier of the Menagerie  

3G  

Creature — Naga Cleric  

3/4  

You may look at the top card of your library. *(You may do this at any time.)*  

You may cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card.  

You may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast creature spells.


* Vizier of the Menagerie lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction—see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
* If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish casting that spell or activating that ability. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
* Normally, Vizier of the Menagerie allows you to cast the top card of your library if it's a creature card, it's your main phase, and the stack is empty. If that creature card has flash, you'll be able to cast it any time you could cast an instant, even on an opponent's turn.
* You may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast any creature spell, not just creature spells that you cast from the top of your library.
* You'll still pay all costs for that spell, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs such as emerge or that of As Foretold.
* The top card of your library isn't in your hand, so you can't cycle it, discard it, or activate any of its activated abilities.

Each player will know the choices made by the players who chose before them.

Flying  

Whenever you cycle or discard a card, target creature gains flying until end of turn.


* Giving a creature flying after it's already been blocked won't change or undo that block. If you want the flying to affect what can block the creature, you must cycle or discard a card during the declare attackers step at the latest.
