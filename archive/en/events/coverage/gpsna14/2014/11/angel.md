Houston native Angel Solache got a bit of the short shrift after Day 1. With three players at 9-0, including a large name like David Ochoa, Solache, at 8-0-1, was a little left out. But all that changed in the first few rounds of Day 2. After Round 12, he was the only remaining player without a loss. Solache had slayed two of undefeateds himself, including Mr. Ocho.



 I sat down with Angel, who is sitting pretty with a good chance for Top 8, to see how this youngster (from a tournament-*Magic* perspective) is feeling.
