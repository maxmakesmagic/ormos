Your opponent is Adam. You and he are playing using only *Time Spiral* cards. The game has been long and quirky. You just drew the last card in your library, a Magus of the Disk. Realizing that you have to win this turn, you looked at your cards in hand and in play and what Adam had in play (Adam currently has no cards in hand). After a little study, you realize that you can win. It is the beginning of your first main phase. **Defeat Adam this turn without losing.**
