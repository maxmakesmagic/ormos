Until then let's take a closer look at a new piece of art in *Commander* (2013 Edition). Specifically let's look at [Tempt with Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempt+with+Vengeance) because I think there's something interesting on that art which is beautifully subtle.


First, let's look at the card:

The fire in the art is shaped unusually and as you read the rules text you might realize that the flames look alive and vaguely animalistic, like, say, elementals!

If we take a look at his initial sketch, the concept becomes much more obvious, but the art direction team asked him to make them more irregular in shape such that they weren't just flame hounds or anything.
