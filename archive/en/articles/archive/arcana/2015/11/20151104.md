Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






As of today, all of the face cards for the *Commander (2015 Edition)* decks have been shown off, with Meren of Clan Nel Toth filling in the final hole in today's [Uncharted Realms](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/all-cairns-jund-2015-11-04). Given that, I think it's high time we show off the packaging!


Let's start with Ms. Meren and work our way through the other four.
