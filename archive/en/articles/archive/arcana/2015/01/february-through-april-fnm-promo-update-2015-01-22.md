February through April FNM Promo Update
=======================================



 Posted in **Arcana**
 on January 22, 2015 










If you follow these regular updates on the [FNM promos](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/friday-night-magic), you'll know we're in the middle of doing something pretty cool with them. If you don't and you're just tuning in, first, welcome, and second, well, we're doing something pretty cool with FNM promos.



For all three months shown here, the promos have alternative *Khans of Tarkir* art that shows a timeline where dragons rule the roost. To wit:



February
========



This [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke) promo shows off a dragon in place of the Naga casting the spell. The flavor text takes on a whole new meaning when you imagine a dragon being quoted in an alternative timeline.

March
=====



[Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), the March FNM promo card, closely mirrors the original (with art still by Zoltan Boros!). Now, though, instead of a trio of goblins emerging from shelter to rush into battle, they're fleeing a dragon who looks very, very hungry.

April
=====



Finally we come to April and this eerie rendition of [Suspension Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suspension+Field) by Seb McKinnon. Here, a shadowy dragon is now the one doing the suspending, although, if I were the person trapped in the field, I might actually be thanking my lucky stars I'm not just being eaten by the dragon.
