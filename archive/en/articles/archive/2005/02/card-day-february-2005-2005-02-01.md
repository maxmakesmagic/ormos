**Card of the Day - lundi 28 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Seat%20of%20the%20Synod)#### Seat of the Synod


 *Mirrodin* common. During the world-building phase of *Mirrodin*, Mark Tedin noticed a doodle at the bottom of a page done by Greg Staples. Tedin asked Staples if he could use that sketch, and after doing his own version it became the concept sketch for the Lumengrid (pictured here and on other cards). 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 25 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wall%20of%20Roots)#### Wall of Roots


 *Mirage* common. In one of the most bizarre rules issues ever, a deck showed up at a PTQ in ’98 built around using Wall of Roots infinite times “between turns”. Because it was nobody’s turn, you could use the ability as many times as you wanted (or so the argument went). Stasis was used to skip your untap phase, at which point Magma Mine was used to kill off the bewildered opponent. The deck was named “Wall of Boom” - and was quickly killed off by rules clarifications. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 24 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Parallax%20Tide)#### Parallax Tide


 *Nemesis* rare. All three parallax global enchantments from *Nemesis* were quickly given errata, because as worded, you could destroy them in response to their effect so that the removed permanents were gone for good! 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 23 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Transmogrifying%20Licid)#### Transmogrifying Licid


 *Exodus* uncommon. The *Exodus* designers wanted to add an artifact Licid, so they looked back to see if there were any artifacts that behaved like local enchantments. The answer? Ashnod's Transmogrant, from *Antiquities*.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 22 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Humility)#### Humility


 *Tempest* rare. Called Divine Might during design, this card was originally a ![2 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif) sorcery that said "All creatures become 0/1 white sheep creatures until end of turn." 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 21 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ogre%20Enforcer)#### Ogre Enforcer


 *Visions* rare. This seemingly innocuous little card caused more rules chaos than any card printed before it in the history of the game. While there were many reasons for the confusion, one of the main factors was a ruling at the time that said even reducing his toughness to zero wouldn't, on its own, take the ogre out!
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 18 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Victual%20Sliver)#### Victual Sliver


 *Stronghold* uncommon. In the spirit of Wednesday's Card of the Day, Victual Sliver also had a translation error slip through to become its name. The Japanese version of this card is actually named "school lunch sliver". 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 17 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Meloku%20the%20Clouded%20Mirror)#### Meloku the Clouded Mirror


 *Champions of Kamigawa* rare. While here in the U.S. we often describe "the man on the moon," in Japan they see a rabbit, known as tsuki-usagi. Kamigawa's moonfolk were concepted by Japanese artist Ittoku, who introduced the subtle rabbit-like elements (white hair, long ears, and so on). The idea of the moonfolk came from a famous Japanese folktale about the mythical Lady Kaguya.
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 16 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Greater%20Good)#### Greater Good


 *Urza's Saga* rare. While the vast majority of non-English cards come out correctly, translational mistakes have slipped through with a few older cards. As told earlier, Yawgmoth's Agenda was nearly called "Yawgmoth's Dayplanner" in Japanese, but the error was caught. The mistake on this one wasn't, so now it's basically named "Better Merchandise" in Japan. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 15 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kei%20Takahashi)#### Kei Takahashi


 *Legends* rare. Gold cards were introduced to **Magic** in *Legends*, the game's third expansion set. Back then the various color combinations were far less defined, which may help explain why this particular creature has green in its casting cost. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 14 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eternal%20Warrior)#### Eternal Warrior


 *Legends* uncommon. Though Kamigawa is the first feudal Japan-inspired block, **Magic**'s first portrayal of a samurai in card art actually goes all the way back to this card from 1994. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 11 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wintermoon%20Mesa)#### Wintermoon Mesa


 *Prophecy* rare. 70 different lands have been printed which come into play tapped. Of them, only four others produce colorless mana but can't produce colored mana: Boseiju, Who Shelters All, Cloudpost, Krosan Verge, and Untaidake, the Cloud Keeper.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 10 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Winter's%20Grasp)#### Winter's Grasp


 *Tempest* uncommon. It's rare to find a card originally costed at C2 (1 colored mana and 2 colorless mana) get reprinted with the exact same set of abilities at CC1 instead. Green originally had this spell at C2 in Alpha (Ice Storm) but green land destruction after that has always been ![1 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif) or higher. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 9 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Winter%20Blast)#### Winter Blast


 *Legends* rare. Winter Blast is the only green card in the game that can tap multiple opposing creatures outside of combat whether they have flying or not. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 8 février 2005**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190613225302im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Winter%20Orb)#### Winter Orb

 Alpha rare. This effect has appeared on three different **Magic** cards, each of which is a different card type. Winter Orb is an artifact, Rising Waters is a blue enchantment, and Hokori, Dust Drinker is a white creature. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 7 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Winter%20Sky)#### Winter Sky


 *Homelands* rare. Of the 41 different "flip a coin" cards in **Magic** so far, all but this one feature a negative (see Wirefly Hive) or non-effect (see Goblin Psychopath) on one side of the flip. Winter Sky is unique because both effects are symmetrical for both players. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 4 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Higure,%20the%20Still%20Wind)#### Higure, the Still Wind


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. This originally made all Ninjas unblockable for free, but when all Ninjas became saboteurs (gaining effects for being unblocked) Higure gained the searching ability. To balance things out, an activation cost was added to the unblockability ability. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 3 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Walker%20of%20Secret%20Ways)#### Walker of Secret Ways


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* uncommon. **Magic**'s Ninjas are associated with stealth and sabotage rather than crude force. In this piece, note that the ninja's finger weapons attach to a vial of some mysterious poison hanging from her wrist. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 2 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ink-Eyes,%20Servant%20of%20Oni)#### Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. During design this card wasn't actually a ninja at first, but once ninjutsu had been finalized the ability on Ink-Eyes was a natural fit for the new mechanic. Note that this is also why Ink-Eyes is considerably beefier than the other ninjas. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 1 février 2005**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ninja%20of%20the%20Deep%20Hours)#### Ninja of the Deep Hours


 *Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. This was the very first card created once the designers had settled on the ninjutsu mechanic, but the version you see today is functionally the same as that early first draft.
