GRAND PRIX MELBOURNE 2009

Yuuya Watanabe has taken not only the title of Grand Prix Melbourne champion this weekend, but also the lead in the Player of the Year Race, catapulting past both Shuuhei Nakamura and Luis Scott-Vargas, despite them both making day two this weekend as well. Also overtaking them is Tomoharu Saito, who is now in second place after losing to Watanabe in the finals. Saito took the lead in the match, with his four color Ally deck taking game one, only to succumb to Watanabe’s first pick Sphinx of Jwar Isle and Vampire horde in games two and three. With his fourth Grand Prix top 8 in a row, Watanabe is looking nigh on unbeatable this season. Tune in next weekend for Pro Tour Austin, and we’ll see if he can keep his streak alive!
