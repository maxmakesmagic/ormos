**Build notes**


Trade | Pop-up messages during a trade have been adjusted to make it clearer when the contents of a trade have been changed. In addition, players can now return to the trade negotiation scene from the trade confirmation scene.


Collection | Fixed an issue that caused some deck lists to import with missing cards.


Collection | The Added To Your Collection pane now defaults to the center of the screen when it appears.


Collection | Improved performance in the cards pane when filtering a large wish list.


Collection | Choosing Select All while in Card View now correctly selects all cards that show with the currently selected filters.


Collection | Corrected the Add to Wishlist option to work the same, regardless of which pane you are selecting it from.


Collection | Outdated blue PTQ tokens have been removed from collections.


Chat | Users with three-letter names no longer crash the game when attempting to chat.


General | Game, Match, and Event/League IDs now show with correct labels in all relevant scenes and panes.


Store| Corrected multiple outdated links in the store.


New Feature: Modify Trade | With tomorrow's downtime, we'll be adding a new feature to trade that allows you to return from the trade confirmation window back to the negotiation scene. This allows players to make changes without cancelling the entire trade and starting over. When reviewing the final trade, click the new Modify Trade button to return to the trade negotiation to adjust the trade. Once adjustments are made, each player will need to submit and confirm the trade again.
