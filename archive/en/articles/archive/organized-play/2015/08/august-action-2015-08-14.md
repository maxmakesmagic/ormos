 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 





The month of August is heating up, and we've got one double-GP weekend before we move into two more action-packed weekends, including PAX Prime at the end of the month.


You can catch coverage info for this weekend's events at the bottom in the Viewing Guide, but we'll begin by talking about the following weekend.


2015 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers
=================================


Coming up this month are the [World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-2015-world-magic-cup-qualifiers) (WMCQs) for the 2015 World *Magic* Cup. The first round of these takes place on August 22–23, in 73 different countries worldwide.


The winner of each World *Magic* Cup Qualifier wins a spot on their country's team in this year's World *Magic* Cup, which takes place December 11–13 in Barcelona, Spain. Those winners will receive a [travel award](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/travel-award-faq) to help them get to Barcelona so that they can compete, and they will be joined by three other teammates representing their country: their nation's national champion along with two more World *Magic* Cup Qualifier winners.


The August 22–23 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers are Standard Constructed. Looking to play in one? [Find the event taking place in your country](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-2015-world-magic-cup-qualifiers), and best of luck!


Eternal Weekend
===============


August 21–23 is also [Eternal Weekend](http://www.cardtitan.com/eternal_weekend), hosted by Card Titan in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Conveniently, the Pennsylvania Convention Center is also the location of the USA's first WMCQ, as Card Titan is hosting that as well.


Friday is all Trials all the time, with Trial events taking place for the World *Magic* Cup Qualifier, Legacy Championship, and Vintage Championship.


Saturday, August 22, features two of the main events, with the World *Magic* Cup Qualifier starting at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. The Top 8 for this WMCQ takes place on Sunday


The second Saturday event is the Legacy Championship, which also starts at 9 a.m. Eastern. All players who compete in the Legacy Championship will receive one of these bad boys:

On Sunday, while the WMCQ Top 8 battles it out for a World *Magic* Cup Qualifier slot, the Vintage Championship will be taking place, featuring some of *Magic*'s most powerful decks in action. Everyone who participates in the Vintage Championship gets an event-exclusive playmat featuring one of *Magic*'s most infamous lands:

Participants in either event also receive an Ultra PRO nine-pocket trade binder with the art for [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) on the front, and the art for [Tolarian Academy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Academy) on the back.


Coverage reporter Adam Styborski will be there providing text coverage, including decklists from both the Legacy and Vintage Championship, so be sure to check DailyMTG for updates next weekend. And if you're in the area and are hungry to bust out those [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s, Moxen, and more, head into Philadelphia and show the Eternal field what you've got!


The Big Weekend
===============


Following all of that is the biggest weekend of the month: PAX Prime weekend.


We talked last week about the coverage you can expect from the 2015 World Championship, but I wanted to follow up on a couple of questions:


* Day One of the World Championship takes place a day before PAX Prime officially opens, which means that the area in which the competitors are playing will be closed off to the public as we make final preparations.
* Starting Friday, which is Day Two of the World Championship, anyone with a badge that gets them into PAX Prime will be welcome inside.
* PAX Prime is seriously going to be awesome. I would love to tell you everything that we've got planned for this event . . . but we're not yet ready. You should, however, check back next week if you'd like to learn what all is going on!

Taking place alongside the World Championship are two Grand Prix as well: one in Prague, and one in Santiago.


Grand Prix Prague's main event is Standard Constructed, and all participants will receive the following event-exclusive playmat:

Meanwhile, Grand Prix Santiago will be *Magic Origins* Limited, and everyone who pre-registered before July 31 will receive this event-exclusive playmat:

While the World Championship is going on, you can still check out text coverage from both Grand Prix throughout the weekend.
