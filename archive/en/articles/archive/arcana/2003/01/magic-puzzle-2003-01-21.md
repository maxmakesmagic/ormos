### The Painland Problem

People like Mark Rosewater and Mark Gottlieb usually have to spend hours coming up with detailed **Magic** puzzles for use here on the web or in other publications. I am a little luckier; I had a perfect puzzle scenario come up in a game of ***Magic** Online.* Here it is:

You are me (AaronForsythe), and your opponent is MagicTheGathering.com web developer Doug Beyer. You are playing [Casual Format 2](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/magiconline/casualformat2) on ***Magic** Online,* which requires a 250-card deck containing at least 20 cards of each color. There is no sideboard, so Wish cards (like [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish)) can be used to get cards from your collection.

Doug had to [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) last turn because you stole his [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) with [Persuasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion). Unfortunately, your [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) also died in the 'Quake, giving Doug his [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) back. He also has a [Death Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Grasp) in hand. If he gets to untap, he will kill you.

You have a nice setup in play with both [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) and [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake), but unfortunately five of your six lands are painlands, and you are only at 2 life. Doug is at six and is tapped out. Using the cards in your hand, can you find a way to defeat Doug this turn without dying yourself?

Assume your collection includes 4 copies of every card from *Seventh Edition, Invasion* block, *Odyssey* block, and *Onslaught*.

![Magic Puzzle](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/269_dougpuzzleSMALL.jpg)I'll put the answers up on Thursday (there is more than one, but not many).

Here is a text listing of all the relevant cards, in case someone needs to click on the name to read the text.
