As I was finishing up writing about Carlos Romão's world-beating exploits, a hand fell across my shoulder. It was my good friend Willy Edel coming to say goodbye.


*What? It's only round two!*


The multiple Pro Tour top 8er explained.


"I've gone 0-2 today, beaten both times against favorable matchups."


That's cause for disappointment, for sure, but not a cause to be leaving with ten rounds still to play, and top 8 very much still alive.

"I can't risk playing any more today," he continued. "I have a very high ranking, and I'm probably going to qualify for Worlds as long as it stays about where it is now. If I have a third loss now, I probably need six or seven wins in a row just to avoid losing a ton of ratings points, and I can't risk it. It's really sad, but I'm going to drop and go home."


There's no doubt that we may well see Edel again at Worlds. It's also true that much about Planeswalker Points are up in the air, as we wait to find out exactly what the new ratings system means. One thing is certain however: this is the last time players like Willy Edel will get a message along the lines of,


"Thanks for being really, really good at *Magic*. Please stop playing immediately."


Whatever else, that has to be a good thing. Goodbye Willy, hopefully we'll see you in San Francisco.
