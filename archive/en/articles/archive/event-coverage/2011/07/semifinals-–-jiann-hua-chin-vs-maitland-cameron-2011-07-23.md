Chin led off with a [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and a [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). Cameron had no action for the first few turns, then summoned a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). Chin had a [Dispatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispatch) to tap down the Hawk, and pumped his men for a lethal swing.


Chin led with an impressive turn one: two [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite)s, [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) again, Plains and [Shrine of Loyal Legions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Loyal+Legions). Cameron could only raise an eyebrow and [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) the [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk). An [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) dealt with the Shrine, while Chin cast a [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) Idol and another [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk). Cameron dug for a fourth land with a [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). Chin attacked again with his team, knocking Cameron to eight. Cameron cast a [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) to clear the board, but the [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) Idol survived Cameron's Judgment.

Cameron summoned a [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) and tried to mount a defense. Chin was having none of it, and his creatures wiped out Gideon one turn and Cameron the next.


**Jiann Chin 2 – Maitland Cameron 0**


Chin started off slower this time around, with a [Signal Pest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) and a [Shrine of Loyal Legions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Loyal+Legions). Cameron summoned a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s to provide some defense. Cameron once again had an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) for the Shrine. Chin summoned and attacked with a [Porcelain Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire). Chin then grew his army with a [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) and a [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), effectively a free card off the [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal).


Cameron's [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) cleaned up the board, and the control player stabilised his game on a comfortable 20 life. Cameron cast a [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) and returned his [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s to play. Chin had a [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) Idol and a second [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), threatening to grow his army to unmanageable sizes.

Cameron mounted an offensive with a Colonnade and his Titan. Chin took blows for several turns, then activated and double-pumped two [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) with his Overseers. He attacked for lethal, but Cameron had a [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) to stay alive and swing back for the win.


**Maitland Cameron 1 – Jiann Chin 2**


Chin started with a [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge) and a [Steel Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer). Cameron had a [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) and an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) to keep things contained, but Chin merely moved to his lands. Two copies of [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) teamed up, and Cameron could not fend them off fast enough.
