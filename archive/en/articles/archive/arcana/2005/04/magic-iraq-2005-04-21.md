Sun. Sand. Boredom.

And then: air-conditioning and a **Magic** draft.

These US soldiers are in Alpha Company of the 32nd Medical Logistics Battalion, based out of Fort Bragg, NC; they're currently stationed in Balad, Iraq (about 70 km north of Baghdad) sent us photos of a recent **Magic** draft tournament. 'Sup, guys. Hope you've been reading your [Limited Information](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/columnarchive&column=LimitedInformation).

  
 *From left to right: SPC Tedd Chandler, SPC Jason Lewis, 2LT Chad Casey, SPC Chad Courtney, SSG Corey Lord, SPC Adam Kimble, CPL Ryan Marnell, SSG Todd Coble and SPC Karliam Holloway.*

  
*About 15 soldiers there have begun playing **Magic** since unsanctioned organized play began at Camp Anaconda a few weeks ago.* 

  
*It's hot in Balad: **Magic** tournaments are played in the air-conditioned blood storage tent to keep cool. Note the cardboard boxes marked "Human Blood" in the background.*

Keep safe, guys!
