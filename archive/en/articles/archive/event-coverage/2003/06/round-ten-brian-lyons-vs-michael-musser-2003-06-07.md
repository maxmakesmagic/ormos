 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






Dave Williams reluctantly gave Bryan Lyons some advice before he turned in his deck sheet. “I odn’t want to tell you this because I might have to play you and I can’t afford to lose a match today… But if you could play a million lands you would right?” Bryan won the rules set that lets him fix his opening hand. The catch? His hand is only five cards big and he is starting at one life. He is playing Alluren and his opening hand is Forest, Eladamri’s Vineyard, Alluren, Cavern Harpy, and Wirewood Savage. He needs to draw a land on his second draw step and he should win. With a Maggot Carrier and Soul Warden in his deck there is the ever so slight chance he might accidentally draw one of those instead. The more lands he plays the less likely he will draw on his two non-lands in the deck. Bryan ended up registering 300 basic lands in his decklist.

It probably doesn’t matter though since he is the one deck that everyone is prepared for. A single Shock or Duress will cause him to lose the game. “There is a lot of hate for me today!”

His opponent could only laugh, “I have a board for this match too!” Michael Musser won the rules set that reduces the converted casting cost of creatures by one and local enchantments by two. As he shuffled he was quick to point out his main deck Mesmeric Fiends—they only cost B in his deck—and the four Maggot Carriers in his board. 

### Game one

Bryan won the die roll and elected to play. Michael could not resist the joke, “Are you good or do you want to mulligan?” No one was surprised when Bryan played his Vineyard. Michael played a Swamp and cast Mesmeric Fiend and Bryan could not possibly win any longer. “Now I board in four Maggot Carriers against you… You realize you are not winning a match in this format right?”

Bryan - 0 Michael -1

### Game two

Bryan had his same opening but Michael had the Maggot Carrier this time.

Bryan - 0 Michael - 2
