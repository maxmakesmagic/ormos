Was your Prerelease this epic?


Perks and Prizes at Paladins Game Castle
========================================


[Paladins Game Castle](https://www.facebook.com/paladinsgamecastle) in Bakersfield, California, held a costume contest and let their community vote on their favorites. The winner was Tzu-Chi Hsu with an impressive Eldrazi costume!

They went all out with hanging hedron decorations, delicious mana-sprinkled cupcakes, and hedron cookies.

Paladins Game Castle layered on the perks with custom-made trophies. They had a hedron trophy for their Two-Headed Giant event and golden Gideon trophies for their main Prerelease event.

The golden Gideons were randomly distributed at the beginning of the event and could be won as bounty/king-of-the-hill prizes throughout the event.


In addition to all of that, they gave away swag bags that included a button, a pen, a life pad, and a free pass to one of their Friday Night *Magic* events!


Cool Mini-Game at Critical Hit Games
====================================


[Critical Hit Games](https://www.facebook.com/Critical-Hit-Games-133935509995609/timeline/), located in Abingdon, Maryland, turned their store into Zendikar by covering it with wild vines and floating hedrons!

On top of that, they created their own ring-toss mini-game using colored papercraft hedrons as the targets.


Players could earn points based on the "rarity" of the hedron they hooked: one point for common (black), two points for uncommon (silver), three points for rare (gold), and four points for mythic rare (mythic orange).


The store used a scoreboard to track points over the course of the whole weekend, and players could come back and play at each new Prerelease event.

To add to the fun, prizes like promos, snacks, playmats, and even a *From the Vault: Angels* pack were given away based on points.


Dazzling Decor at Big Orbit Games
=================================


[Big Orbit Games](https://www.facebook.com/bigorbitgames/) in Evesham, United Kingdom, created a lush "Misty Rainforest" lounge area at the entrance of their store!

This isn't the first time that Big Orbit Games has decorated their store, nor will it be the last!


The trend started with a  [*Khans of Tarkir*–themed bivouac](https://www.facebook.com/bigorbitgames/photos/pb.547172528657758.-2207520000.1444336464./753572918017717/?type=3&src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-frc3%2Ft31.0-8%2F10620472_753572918017717_2577040883099797824_o.jpg&smallsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-xtp1%2Fv%2Ft1.0-9%2F10670210_753572918017717_2577040883099797824_n.jpg%3Foh%3D931b5dbbc3ea22322811cb77c760f66d%26oe%3D568769DB&size=2048%2C1370&fbid=753572918017717) , followed by a [giant Ugin](https://www.facebook.com/bigorbitgames/photos/pb.547172528657758.-2207520000.1444336426./822716661103342/?type=3&src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-xfa1%2Ft31.0-8%2F10904395_822716661103342_1574219656548748960_o.jpg&smallsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-xlp1%2Fv%2Ft1.0-9%2F10930857_822716661103342_1574219656548748960_n.jpg%3Foh%3D2a0a82c7ecede6506c4481e4c466e164%26oe%3D5692F0CC&size=2048%2C1536&fbid=822716661103342) for *Fate Reforged*, and then [another bivouac](https://www.facebook.com/bigorbitgames/photos/pb.547172528657758.-2207520000.1444336416./853302848044723/?type=3&src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-prn2%2Ft31.0-8%2F11048643_853302848044723_5901324045784609874_o.jpg&smallsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-xpa1%2Fv%2Ft1.0-9%2F1484689_853302848044723_5901324045784609874_n.jpg%3Foh%3Dfee3de13da889463d6927bca53831a53%26oe%3D56863E19&size=2048%2C1536&fbid=853302848044723) for *Dragons of Tarkir*—and they're not stopping there!

The creative store plans on continuing the trend for the next set, *Oath of the Gatewatch*. Whatever they're planning, it's bound to be just as unforgettable.
