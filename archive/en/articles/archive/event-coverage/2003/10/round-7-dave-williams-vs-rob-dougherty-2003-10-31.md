![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/930.jpg)[Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) or no, Rob Dougherty can't be pried away from Reanimator in Extended. You can't fault him for it, seeing as how the deck has brought plenty of success, including a finalist appearance at last year's Extended Pro Tour in Houston. In lieu of the banned [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), Dougherty is playing [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp). Laughable, yes, but it allows for second turn Akromas. Williams is playing the [Food Chain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Food+Chain) Goblin deck, that has plenty of pure aggression and an ability to "go off" as well. 

### Game 1

Dougherty opened with [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp).

Williams- "What in the...?!?!"  
 Dougherty- "I'll tell you what I've told everyone else, I lost a bet. But hey, have you tested against first turn [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp)?"

Williams played [Mox Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) and a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), then a [Goblin Piledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver). Dougherty discarded Akroma to the Imp and [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d it, then attacked with the Angel and the Imp for seven damage. Williams couldn't find the [Food Chain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Food+Chain) he needed to go off, and conceded.

### Game 2

Williams started with [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), mountain, and [Goblin Recruiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter), then set up an army on top of his library. [Goblin Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief) came out and attacked along with the Recruiter for three damage, and Dougherty cast Wordly Tutor on end step to get Akroma. The dreaded [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) came out on turn two, but Dougherty had no other play. The Goblins continued to gain numbers with a second Warchief and [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), and they all headed for the Red Zone.

Dougherty cast [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), then chump blocked the Warchief with the Imp. [Sickening Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams) for two wiped all of Williams' creatures off the board and put Akroma in the graveyard, but brought Dougherty down to four life. Williams came back with a Piledriver, and Dougherty cast [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) to get Akroma, but this brought him to three, where one last attack was able to finish him off easily.

Williams- 1 Dougherty- 1

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/931.jpg)Dougherty had a first turn [Tarnished Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarnished+Citadel), and Williams played [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), then a Piledriver on turn two. [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) on end step was followed by [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) on Goblins, and Williams played a Ringleader, which got him a Prospector and a Recruiter. Despite the Plague, the two Goblins still dealt three damage when they attacked. [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) took the Recruiter out of Williams' hand, leaving the Prospector, [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) and a Warchief.

The Warchief was summoned and attacked with the rest of the team, dealing six damage total to bring Dougherty to four life points. [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) blocked and traded with the Piledriver, and a Recruiter came out and died immediately, but the search effect still triggered. With no answers left, Dougherty conceded.

**Final Result:** Williams- 2 Dougherty- 1
