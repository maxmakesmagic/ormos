Check out the full art of *Future Sight's* wind-controlling legend, Linessa, Zephyr Mage.

Linessa is a descendant of Alexi, Zephyr Mage (or will be, when that possible future comes to passâ€”only time will tell when that occurs). Note that she carries the same staff that Alexi held. It's held up well, but shows its age in a bit more character and texture.

Also note the building in the background of Linessa's art. That's part of [Tolaria West](/en/articles/archive/tolaria-west-2007-05-30), a new mystical academy built among the storm-swept Spice Islands of Dominaria (since the old [Academy was destroyed](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1344_AcademyRuinsQuote.jpg)). Linessa could be very useful in helping the fledgling academy face initial obstacles. Seriously, someone with some mastery of wind magic needs to do something about those [acid rainstorms](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1288)...
