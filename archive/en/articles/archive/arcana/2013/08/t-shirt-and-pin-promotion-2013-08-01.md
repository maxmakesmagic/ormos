 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 







You probably know about [mtgmerch.com](http://www.mtgmerch.com/), where you can pick up t-shirts, pins, and other cool **Magic**-related merchandise. In case you didn't, now you do! 

 With ***Magic** 2014*  in full swing and *Theros* on the horizon, it means we will soon be bidding *adieu* to the Ravnica guild shirts and pins. That means this is your last chance to get your hands on them—when they're gone, they're gone! 

But what if you want both a shirt and a pin? Well, never to fear—our good friends at Araca are running a promotion there! For a limited time, while supplies last, you can get a free Ravnica pin whenever you buy a Ravnica tee!

 As seasoned **Magic** players know, two-for-ones are powerful—so take advantage of this real-life two-for-one while you can and [head on over to check it out](http://www.mtgmerch.com/)!
