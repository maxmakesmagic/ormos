A number of non-foil, double-sided *Ixalan* cards in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), and Korean were mistakenly printed on the incorrect card stock. Although not printed on typical *Magic* card stock, these cards contain the unique holofoil stamp applied to all rares and mythic rares that guarantees authenticity. They are real *Magic* cards made by Wizards of the Coast and are tournament legal.


A full list of the affected cards is below. If you have questions, please contact Customer Support at (800) 324-6496 or [@Wizards\_Help](http://www.twitter.com/Wizards_Help) on Twitter and we'll be happy to help.
