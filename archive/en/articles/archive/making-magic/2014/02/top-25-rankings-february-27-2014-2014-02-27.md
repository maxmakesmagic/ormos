At  [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](/en/events/coverage/ptbngs14), every single player in our **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings was in action, and the ramifications were, as expected, huge. There were four climbers, twelve fallers, seven new entries, seven who fell through the Top 25 trapdoor, and a new No. 1. That man? Jérémy Dezani of France. The  [Pro Tour *Theros*](/en/events/coverage/ptthr13) champion followed up with a four-round win streak at the end of Day Two to propel him to an 18th-place finish, good enough for 10 Pro Points and a lead over previous No. 1, Ben Stark, who drops to No. 2. Up to No.3, all the way from the 12th spot on the list, is season standout Owen Turtenwald. He may not have won the Pro Tour, but his never-say-die attitude saw him climb the table past multiple Pro Tour champions, World Champions, and Players of the Year. 

 Another player who simply refused to go quietly into the night was Tom Martell. The  [Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](/en/events/coverage/ptgtc13) champion was in terrible trouble at 2–3, but piled on the wins down the stretch for a hugely creditable 21st-place finish in Valencia. Alexander Hayne also profited, moving to within a point of the Top 10. For the rest of last week's Top 25, however, it was either "down" or "out," as David Ochoa, Jon Stern, Raphaël Lévy, Brian Kibler, Craig Wescoe, Ari Lax, and Christian Calcano all got the axe, at least for now. 

That left room for seven new entries, and four of those featured in the Top 8 in Valencia. Finalist Jacob Wilson is the highest new entry at No. 11, while Champion Shaun McLaren enters the Top 25 for the first time at No. 21. Quarterfinalists Chris Fennell and Lee Shi Tian also join the rankings list, while just out of the spotlight, Josh McClain, Gaudenis Vidugiris, and Matej Zatlkaj were all putting together runs that propelled them into the Top 25.

 The **Magic** keeps right on coming, with Melbourne playing host to video coverage for the first time in Australia, while many of the stellar *Born of the Gods* cast remains in Spain for a much-heralded Team Grand Prix in Barcelona. Join us again next week, as we follow the ongoing story of the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
