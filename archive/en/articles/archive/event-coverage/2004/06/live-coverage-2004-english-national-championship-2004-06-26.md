Welcome to the 2004 English nationals. Held in the impressive Think Tank, Birmingham. 


This year is even more interesting than usual as this is the first major tournament to feature 5th dawn cards and also the first without [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). English nationals is traditionally a breading ground for new decks, some past favourites include Dan Paskins Red deck Wins and Hampton Court Palaces Trinity Green. The Favourites this year include Britains top pro player Sam Gommersal, Pro tour Boston second place finisher Jake Smith, Sideboard reporter Scott Wills, Twice national champion Oliver Schneider and Pro deck builder John Ormerod. Pre tournament talk is that the field will feature heavily White based control deck, with the much hyped Krark Clan Iron Works appearing but with a smaller showing than was expected. The field however is expected to have an interesting variety of decks.
