Ever in search of adventure, *Magic*'s premier pyromancer and Planeswalker Chandra Nalaar strikes out on her own, determined to protect the Multiverse and help those who cannot help themselves! But as new threats arise, she finds herself haunted by the failings of her past . . . and confronted by a sinister foe hoping to prey on her weakness. Plagued by demons—both figuratively *and* literally—it'll take more than fireballs for Chandra to win the day. Can Chandra save those in peril . . . including herself?


Written by Vita Ayala with interior art by Harvey Tolibao and cover art by Ken Lashley, *Magic: The Gathering – Chandra #1* hits shelves December 12, but you can get a sneak peek of the first six pages right now! After you check out this early look at Chandra's comic book debut, be sure to mark your calendars to pick up the first issue next week, available at your local comic book shop and [online at comiXology](https://www.comixology.com/Magic-The-Gathering-Chandra-1/digital-comic/713452).
