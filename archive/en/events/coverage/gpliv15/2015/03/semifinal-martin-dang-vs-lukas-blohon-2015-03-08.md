Here seasoned veteran of Grands Prix and Pro Tour Lukas Blohon met as yet unknown Martin Dang. Dang had drafted a blue-black deck with a bit of red, while Blohon was basically on green and white with just the tiniest hint of black (being able to turn [Abzan Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide) face-up with [Sandsteppe Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Citadel)).


Game 1
======


Blohon had a fine start with a morphed creature, [Dragon Bell Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Bell+Monk) and [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief). However, it took him a while to draw a fourth land and even then was unable to find a second source of white mana.

Meanwhile, Dang had his own morphs and a pair of [Jeskai Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Sage)s along with [Orc Sureshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orc+Sureshot). At some point, he managed to put Blohon at 4 with the help of [Mindswipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindswipe) and [Swarm of Bloodflies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+of+Bloodflies) took the first game.


**Martin Dang 1-0 Lukas Blohon**


Game 2
======


Both players amassed quite a number of ground creatures, but Dang also had one [Swarm of Bloodflies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+of+Bloodflies) nibbling away at Blohon's lifetotal. Soon, Blohon was forced to get in there with his creatures.

The attack, during which he also unmorphed [Master of Pearls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Pearls), did take away some of Dang's creatures and life points. However, it also turned [Swarm of Bloodflies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+of+Bloodflies) into a 5/5. And the resulting attack put Blohon well into the reach of Dang's [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws).


**Martin Dang 2-0 Lukas Blohon**
