Status isn't everything on the Pro Tour, but it sure helps. Rising through the Pro Players Club ranks is one of the many goals competitors carry to each event. In a match like so many others out on the floor, both players needed to make a fantastic finish to level up. Patrick Cox had a quiet year, and it would take a Top 16 or better to renew his Gold status. Similarly, David Ochoa was looking for the same to renew Platinum level. After all, ensuring you have a flight and hotel for every Pro Tour goes a long way toward attending all of them.



**The Players**



Patrick Cox had earned Gold status in the previous seasons with finishes like his Top 8 at Pro Tour Nagoya and two finalist appearances at Grand Prix Austin and Denver in 2012. With a smattering of Top 16s and other cashes this season, he had a long road ahead of him.



 David Ochoa had been a Platinum player more multiple years. He made his first Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*, and has appeared at both the 2012 *Magic* Players Championship and the 2013 *Magic* World Championship. This was the first season in some time his standing was under threat.



"I've got 31 points right now," Ochoa said. "I need one extra point for Gold," referring to the 3 Pro Points he gets for participating, "and Top 16 for Platinum... maybe World Championship. I'd need to check the standings; I've been in the 'cool kids' room for awhile." The critical 45 Pro Point threshold was a tall order.


It was too early to tell, but after starting 3-0 through the first Draft rounds they were both well on their way.





*Both David Ochoa and Patrick Cox were in dire need of a big finish this weekend to retain their targeted Pro Players Club statuses.*
