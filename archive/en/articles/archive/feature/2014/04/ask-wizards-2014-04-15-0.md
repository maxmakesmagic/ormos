 **Q: Omnath had counters that helped keep track of how much mana was in your mana pool. How would you recommend players keep track of Kruphix mana turn-to-turn? —[jcomstock88](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/post/82295450436/omnath-had-counters-that-helped-keep-track-of-how-much)**
  

 **A: Matt Tabak, Magic rules manager:**



Use counters. Or dice. Or pen and paper. Anything that lets you keep track of what is likely a single digit number. :)


 **Q: I just wanted to double check something on Kruphix. As a result of his last ability, all mana will stay in your pool right? It almost seems like you would lose the colorless mana. —[insertcreativepersonalblogname](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/post/82317585019/i-just-wanted-to-double-check-something-on-kruphix-as)**
  

 **A: Matt Tabak, Magic rules manager:**



No, you keep the mana. If the unspent mana would empty, instead something else happens. That means the first thing doesn’t happen at all.


 **Q: How does Kruphix interact with cards like Geosurge—do the mana restrictions stay on the colorless mana, or is it completely replaced and free to be used as one would like? Thanks! —[broadlover](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/post/82317651061/hello-matt-how-does-kruphix-interact-with-cards-like)**
  

 **A: Matt Tabak, Magic rules manager:**



If your mana has any riders on it ([Geosurge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geosurge), [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop), [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls), etc.), those remain. Only the color of the mana changes.


 **Q: If Kruphix is killed my colourless mana empties correct?—[baronvonpunchy](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/post/82317706338/if-kruphix-is-killed-my-colourless-mana-empties)**
  

 **A: Matt Tabak, Magic rules manager:**



When the phase or step ends, yes.
