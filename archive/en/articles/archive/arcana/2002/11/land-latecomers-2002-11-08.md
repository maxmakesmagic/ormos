As previous installments of Magic Arcana have pointed out, [Volcanic Island](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/70) and [Circle of Protection: Black](/en/articles/archive/alpha-oops-v-2002-07-12) were both left out of Alpha (the first edition of **Magic**), and were added into Beta.

But five other cards not in Alpha were also added to Beta--basic lands. The original set had only two pictures for each basic land; Beta added a third for each.

Below are the images of the "added" lands.
