*What's the most unusual place you've ever played **Magic**?*


![Bill Stark](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_billstark.jpg)**Bill Stark:** The weirdest (but one of the coolest) places I ever played **Magic** was on a train from Berlin. Traveling with some fellow **Magic** pros after Pro Tour–Prague, we happened upon a train car filled with a bunch of German high school students. It just happened that a few of them were playing a group game of **Magic**, and I pointed out why we were in Europe as we passed through the car.


Before long they had challenged us to an epic battle, and for the rest of my life I will never forget how awesome it was to play **Magic** on a train in Germany while a horde of locals pressed in to see if their friends could beat the Americans. It was pretty wild.
