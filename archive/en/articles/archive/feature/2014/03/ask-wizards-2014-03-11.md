Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!


Last week, on [his Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), Mark Rosewater was asked [a simple question](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/78578743473/hey-can-you-give-a-high-five-to-matt-tabak-for-us) that then ballooned into hijinks in R&D. Here's what happened.


—Mike McArtor, copy editor of DailyMTG.com


**Q: Hey, can you give a high-five to Matt Tabak for us? —godavarism** 


**A: Mark Rosewater:** 


I'm not sure I can. He's very tall.


 


Well, the next day, he posted [a follow-up](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/78700728511/attempting-to-high-five-matt-tabak):


**[Attempting to High-Five Matt Tabak](https://vine.co/v/MAUOUiBrBMT)**


I tried. I really tried.


 


Which, of course, spurred [an additional question](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/78716620832/that-vine-five-was-hilarious-may-i-ask-how-tall-you):


**Q: That Vine five was hilarious. May I ask how tall you two actually are? —combatcotton** 


**A: Mark Rosewater:** 


I'm 5'5" and Matt is 6'8".


Mark is not the only R&D member with [a Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/). Rules Manager [Matt Tabak](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/) and Senior Creative Designer [Doug Beyer](http://dougbeyermtg.tumblr.com/) also maintain active Tumblr accounts.
