The May 9, 2017 Update
======================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 9, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [game show host Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa](#4). I would watch that.


Today's Must
============


1. [My Story](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/my-story/) | ChannelFireball | Ondřej Stráský

They say restriction breeds creativity, and the week prior to the Pro Tour is one of the most restrictive times possible for *Magic* content creators attending the Pro Tour. That restriction bred a nice reflective piece where Stráský looks back at his *Magic* journey and draws some lessons from it.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [A Practical Guide to Matchup Analysis](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35080_A-Practical-Guide-To-Matchup-Analysis.html) | StarCityGames.com | Jadine Klomparens

"[Who's the Beatdown](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/fundamentals/3692_Whos_The_Beatdown.html)" has been the gold standard for matchup analysis for a long time—so long that Klomparens thinks we need to revisit how we analyze roles in various matchups. *Magic* has changed quite a bit in the past 20 years, and asking ourselves who the beatdown is has become a bit more nuanced. Klomparens looks to create a framework for how it works in modern *Magic*.


1. [Eyes on the Pro Tour: Rich Hagon](https://eyesonthemise.podbean.com/e/eyes-on-the-pro-tour-rich-hagon/) | Eyes on the Mise | John Wells

Are you incredibly excited for [Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptakh)? Who wouldn't be? So if you *just* can't wait for Rich Hagon to tickle your ears with some of the most British-sounding puns this side of the pond, check out this episode of Eyes on the Mise.


1. [Keep or Mulligan?](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/keep-or-mulligan-8/) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

The classic PVDDR column returns. It could almost be a game show. The fact that no one has photoshopped Paulo's head onto a game show host's body is one of my eternal disappointments with our community.


1. [The *Magic Online* Paths to Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/05/magic-online-paths-pro-tour-amonkhet/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Rich Stein

Stein continues his week-long deep dive into the Pro Tour by looking at qualification paths to the Pro Tour through *Magic* *Online*. Or, ya know, what the headline says. Sometimes you don't really need me for this part. Though it does include a little bit on Brandon Burton and what makes him special for Pro Tour *Amonkhet*. Ha! Bet you didn't know that, did you, headline skimmers?


1. [MTG Deck Tech: Foretold Seasons Control in *Amonkhet* Standard!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4p_v-E-nQ4) | Aether Hub | Matt (from TotalMTG)

Remember [Seasons Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past)? Remember how it made the Top 8 of [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi)? Remember that it's *still* Standard-legal? True story. It was always pretty mana-intensive, but *Amonkhet* contains another card that cares about casting cost that just might help: [As Foretold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=As+Foretold). By combining the two, you can do a lot more with the cards you return faster. It takes some setting up, but once you get there, your opponents are going to feel pretty helpless. And isn't that just the best feeling?


Top 25
======


1. Motion Across the Oceans

After a multi-week hiatus, the Top 25 has some movement! Three Grand Prix created a ton of action up and down the list. Brian Braun-Duin, Eduardo Sajgalik, and Martin "Hold my beer" Jůza were the big winners, moving up five, six, and eight slots, respectively. Though the real winner is Kelvin Chew, who is our latest to join the Top 25, moving in at No. 21.


That means we lost one as Mike Sigrist fell *juuuust* outside the Top 25 for the first time in quite a long time. I have no doubt he'll be back—as could a lot of people with strong performances at the Pro Tour this weekend.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [WotC's Community Team is asking us what we want to be included in a formal "Commitment to the *Magic* Community"](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6a0qlq/wotcs_community_team_is_asking_us_what_we_want_to/)

Yes, we are. We released the survey yesterday afternoon, and it immediately got people talking about both the survey itself and what people should answer. You can see some discussion at the link above or just [take the survey yourself by clicking here](http://sgiz.mobi/s3/e44bf6bb036f).


1. [*Magic: The Gathering*—*Amonkhet* Swords](http://mtg-realm.tumblr.com/post/160477960841/magic-the-gathering-amonkhet-swords-there-are-a) | MTG-Realm

This was a surprisingly interesting, yet short, read on the khopesh, the Egyptian-style sword depicted in a number of *Amonkhet* cards.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Mono-Black Zombies](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-05-08)

Zombies have risen on *Magic Online*, as Mono-Black Zombies is repeatedly putting up 5-0 results. The list below is from Paanika, but it could have been from any number of people. And, yes, mono-black, rather than black-white, seems to be the configuration of choice.


The main decks are pretty much as aggressive as they can be, skimping on removal outside of [Dark Salvation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Salvation)—which has received a big kick with *Amonkhet*—and [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push).


Otherwise, the deck is pretty straightforward in the main deck. It wants to devour brains, and to do so quickly.


In the sideboard, [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind) is the catch-all for decks like Marvel and planeswalker-based strategies, while [Dispossess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispossess) handles any number of artifact-based combos, and [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) is possibly the best card for the mirror.


Watch for more Zombie puns at Pro Tour *Amonkhet*, where surely, the dead shall walk among us.
