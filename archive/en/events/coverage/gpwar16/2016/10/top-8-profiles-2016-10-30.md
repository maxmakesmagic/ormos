I would add [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind) to the main deck as it is very important in the mirror and against White-Blue Flash.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Ishkanah, Grafwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ishkanah%2C+Grafwidow).

**Hometown:** Kiev, Ukraine


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


3-5 at Pro Tour *Kaladesh*, 11-4 at Grand Prix Paris, few 10-5 finishes at GPs.

Black-Green Aggro Delirium. The best deck ever.

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpwar16/t8ganz.jpg)Name:** Andreas Ganz


**Age:** 31


**Occupation:** Content manager


**Hometown:** Zürich, Switzerland


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Charlotte 2016 champion, national champion.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Black-Red Aggro. I think the deck is slightly favored versus White-Blue Flash and has game versus Black-Green Delirium. It's also the deck I played at the Pro Tour and had the most experience with.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I think the sideboard could use some retooling, I could see only running three [Weaver of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weaver+of+Lightning) and I might want four [Lightning Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe) in the main deck.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter).

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpwar16/t8_moure.jpg)Name:** Matteo Moure


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Marco Cammilluzzi's son


**Hometown:** Rome, Italy


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Grand Prix London 2015 finalist, Grand Prix Stockholm 2016 finalist, ninth at Pro Tour *Kaladesh*.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Black-Green Aggro. I tested and brainstormed a lot with my friend Cammilluzzi and another friend who is a great online player (\_Batutinha\_) and we believed that this configuration had a good matchup versus Black-Green Delirium and White-Blue Flash which we expected to be the biggest part of the metagame. And it was correct.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I sometimes think I should adjust the sideboard, but for now I am pretty happy with my 75. Sometimes I want one more [Grasp of Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness) in the main deck.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Blossoming Defense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossoming+Defense) for sure!
