What are you doing at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday, March 13, 2013? *Wrong*. You're going to be watching a live Twitch.tv stream.


Why? Well, it's going to feature Worth Wollpert, Ryan Spain, Chris Kiritz, and Sean Gibbons doing a live Q&A about the new **Magic Online** client. They're also going to go through the new client live on your computer screen and show the latest updates.


The stream will be on [our official **Magic** Pro Tour channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magicprotour) from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm Pacific Time on Wednesday, March 13, 2013. Send your questions via Twitter to [@MagicOnline](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/pro-tour-gatecrash-qualifier-season-top-8-standard-decklists-2015-50) and thereâ€™s a chance it will get answered during the stream!


See you there!
