![Demonic Consultation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Demonic+Consultation)*Masters Edition 2* uncommon. [Demonic Consultation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Consultation) was such a powerful tutor that it's rarely even been reprinted in a "fixed" form. One example of that, though, was *Unhinged*'s [Aesthetic Consultation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aesthetic+Consultation), which added a the artist-matters theme to mix things up a bit.  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)![Personal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Personal+Tutor)*Masters Edition 2* uncommon. The person in [Personal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Personal+Tutor) (who looks suspiciously like Whistler's Mother) is not actually the tutor. The tutor is the *book*, which appears to be teaching the person how to cast a [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball).  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)![Grandmother Sengir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grandmother+Sengir)*Masters Edition 2* rare. Although the flavor text indicates differently, [Grandmother Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grandmother+Sengir) is not actually [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir)'s biological grandmother. In fact (as Matt Cavotta [explains here](/en/articles/archive/royal-bloodline-emphasis-blood-2006-02-15)), she was originally a Planeswalker's apprentice that destroyed an entire plane and then lost her mind.  
[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)![Temporal Manipulation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Temporal+Manipulation)*Masters Edition 2* rare. The art description for [Temporal Manipulation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Manipulation) simply reads "Show an intricate thran looking clock or watch." The *Portal Second Age* creative team had complete faith in Anson Maddocks to deliver a compelling piece. And he did![*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)![Kjeldoran Outpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kjeldoran+Outpost)*Masters Edition 2* rare. [Kjeldoran Outpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Outpost) was a very powerful card in the "Counterpost" decks long ago. However, it came with a price: once in awhile, a player would draw a seven-card opening hand that had the Outpost as its only land. By the mulligan rules of the time, the hand had to be kept, even though it would have no way to get mana!

![Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Necropotence)
*Masters Edition 2* rare. [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) dominated tournament **Magic** almost from the day *Ice Age* came out, leading to the "Black Summer" of 1996. In 1999, combo decks like High Tide and Academy ruled the landscape to the point where [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) wasn't in any decks. At that point, Chris Pikula made the famous suggestion, "Ban everything until Necro is good, then ban Necro". And that's pretty much what happened.[*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)![Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brainstorm)
*Masters Edition 2* common. According to Mark Rosewater (in [this article](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ice-guys-finish-first-2004-08-02)), [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) is an example of deceptively simple design. "[Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) is never the star of the deck, yet it helps push the percentage a few points in its controller's favor. It's a subtle card that rewards a skilled player (see, we really do like that). Cards like [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) are very hard to design so when I see one that works, I'm always impressed," he says. [*Masters Edition 2* is coming to **Magic Online**!](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_mastersed2_productinfo)*Masters Edition 2* rare. A "taiga" is technically an open woodland covered in coniferous trees in the far north, such as you find just south of the tundra on Earth. As a forest that's normally in mountainous regions, it was an easy choice for the name of the original [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)-[Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) crossbreed. *Masters Edition 2* is coming! Available exclusively on **Magic Online**, this 245 card set is planned for a September 22 release and will feature many of the greatest cards from **Magic**'s past. And every Card of the Day for the next few weeks will double as a *Masters Edition 2* preview! Keep watching to see what other cards make the set and for more information to be announced shortly. *Masters Edition 2* rare. Originally appearing in *Portal Second Age*, [Sea Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Drake) is one of only five blue three-mana cards that give you a four-power flier. And all the rest either can't attack ([Plumeveil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plumeveil)), can only attack or block once ([Fog Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog+Elemental)), or give up card advantage ([Indentured Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indentured+Djinn) and [Vexing Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Sphinx)). [Sea Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Drake)'s disadvantage can actually work *for* you in the right situation!*Masters Edition 2* is coming! Available exclusively on **Magic Online**, this 245 card set is planned for a September 22 release and will feature many of the greatest cards from **Magic**'s past. And every Card of the Day for the next few weeks will double as a *Masters Edition 2* preview! Keep watching to see what other cards make the set and for more information to be announced shortly. *Masters Edition 2* rare. [Mana Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Crypt) was one of five cards only available by buying one of HarperPrism's **Magic** novels. Purchasers of *Final Sacrifice* received a [Mana Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Crypt), while purchasers of *The Cursed Land* had an equal chance of getting any of the cards (the other four are [Sewers of Estark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sewers+of+Estark), [Windseeker Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windseeker+Centaur), [Giant Badger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Badger), and [Arena](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena)).*Masters Edition 2* is coming! Available exclusively on **Magic Online**, this 245 card set is planned for a September 22 release and will feature many of the greatest cards from **Magic**'s past. And every Card of the Day for the next few weeks will double as a *Masters Edition 2* preview! Keep watching to see what other cards make the set and for more information to be announced shortly. *Torment* common. Q: The [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) has no nose. How does he smell?A: Terrible!*Limited Edition Alpha* rare. The original dual lands had a text box art treatment that consisted of concentric rectangles of the appropriate colors. This was kind of distracting, so it was eventually phased out in favor of shading the left and right sides of the text box different colors.*Legions* rare. Phage is an extremely powerful and complicated character. She began life as Jeska, but Braids gave her a new life as a walking engine of death. It is therefore somewhat odd that one of the cards she appears on is the relatively innocuous [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat). You don't really think of someone who can kill with a touch just hauling off and smacking an underling.*Legends* rare. [Horn of Deafening](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horn+of+Deafening) was secretly an update of [Singing Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Singing+Tree). Apparently, the tree's song becomes deafening when it's transferred into an artifact.*Invasion* rare. When *Weatherlight* (the skyship, not the expansion) was on its way to Benalia, Urza secretly snuck aboard in the disguise of a blind man. After the crew attempted to defend Benalia from the Phyrexians, Urza left as mysteriously as he had arrived.*Limited Edition Alpha* rare. [Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) is one of only 16 cards that have been in every edition from Alpha through *Tenth Edition*. But it's part of an even more exclusive club: cards that have been in every core set and *only* in core sets. No "Portal", no "Starter", no box set. It's core sets or nothing, and there are only four of them. Click here to see the list![Goblin King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King), [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine), [Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare), [Orcish Artillery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Artillery)*Champions of Kamigawa* rare. During the Kami War, many ordinary humans were driven insane by the fighting between the material and spiritual worlds. The hair that strings this koto must be razor sharp—see the blood from the player's fingers?*Unglued* common. The flavor text (*"Sorry we shelled your village—here's some gold."*) of [Clambassadors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clambassadors) references [Reparations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reparations), where the apology is for burning down a village. Naturally, the [Clambassadors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clambassadors) would have shelled the village instead, because, you know. *Shells*.*Lorwyn* common. The boggart in the art of [Springleaf Drum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) does not have four arms. The art actually shows a regular (two-armed) boggart in motion, and it's hands are waving so wildly that it *appears* to have multiple arms. Also, it's using fish, not sticks.*Legends* rare. [Rubinia Soulsinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rubinia+Soulsinger)'s ability was a variant on [Old Man of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Old+Man+of+the+Sea) from *Arabian Nights*, although Rubinia could control any creature and the Old Man was limited by his power. In *Fallen Empires*, the ability returned to the sea with [Seasinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasinger), which could only control creatures if their controller had an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).*Invasion* common. Like [Tribal Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Flames), many cards in the *Invasion* block relied on the "domain" mechanic, meaning they became more powerful for each basic land type a player controlled. While presently that number is five, [that nearly wasn't the case](/en/articles/archive/story-barrys-land-2004-02-19).
