Card of the Day - June, 2013
============================



 Posted in **Feature**

By Mike McArtor




 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 









![Molder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Molder)
  
**[Molder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder)** – *Time Spiral* common. So we're all on the same page with the flavor text, here's a quick rundown: [Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosa) is a forested region on the continent of [Otaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otaria), itself a part of the plane of Dominaria. We first met Kamahl as a [pit fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=pit+fighter) in *Odyssey*, but by *Onslaught* he became a [druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=druid) serving [Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosa). 
 


![Smokestack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Smokestack)
  
**[Smokestack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokestack)** – *Urza's Saga* rare. This card is an instrumental (and eponymous) part of the (in)famous Legacy lockout deck, [Stax](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/deck/497). In case you're curious about the deck but want a more... modern take... a few weeks ago, Gavin Verhey wrote about a 'stack-less [Stax deck](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/249) for the Modern format. 
 


![Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skinrender)
  
**[Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* uncommon. The Praetor of Unity, Elesh Norn leads the Machine Orthodoxy, the Phyrexian faction connected to white mana, under the title of grand cenobite. Sheoldred is first among the seven steel thanes, those who rule the Phyrexian faction connected to black mana. Learn more about all five of *New Phyrexia*'s factions with the [Planeswalker's Guide](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/137a). 
 


![Tidehollow Sculler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tidehollow+Sculler)
  
**[Tidehollow Sculler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler)** – *Modern Masters* uncommon. A [scull](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scull) is "an oar used at the stern of a boat to propel it forward." Thus, a sculler is clearly someone who uses a scull. But what of Tidehollow? It's a region of the Alara shard of [Esper](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/13), back when Alara was in shards, prior to it being reborn. 
 


![Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Echoing+Truth)
  
**[Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth)** – *Modern Masters* common. It's a little hard to see what's going on, but according to the original *Darksteel* art description, that's a [Furnace Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon) "flying above the sea while beams of quicksilver metal shoot up from the ocean to destroy the flying creature." The location, as you probably guessed if you know the plane of *Mirrodin*, is the Quicksilver Sea. 
 


![Sporoloth Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sporoloth+Ancient)
  
**[Sporoloth Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient)** – *Modern Masters* common. Let's break down this big Fungus to see what it (or at least it's name) is made of. The combining form "[sporo](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sporo)" means "seeds or spores." Since we're talking Fungus here, let's go with "spores." And "[loth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bloth%5D)?" It's a combining form used in **Magic** to denote, basically, "big creature." It is most commonly seen as "Baloth." 
 


![Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob)
  
**[Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob)** – *Modern Masters* rare. Squee's name gives us a clue as to what he's all about. The "Goblin" part is pretty obvious, right? Yup! But "Nabob?" Is that some kind of goblin word? Nope! The word "[nabob](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nabob)" entered English via the Urdu language, where it meant a deputy or regional ruler in India. Later, its meaning expanded to encompass someone of wealth and importance. 
 


![Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star)
  
**[Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star)** – *Modern Masters* mythic rare. Ever notice the clouds of gas being expelled from Kokusho's body? Maybe that's why the Kamigawans used the name "Kokusho" to describe this denizen of Takenuma—*koku* (黒) in Japanese means "black," and the *sho* here (瘴) means "miasma" or "polluted gas." (Special thanks to Ron Foster, premier play TO manager [formerly Japan territory manager], for today's entry.) 
 


![Errant Ephemeron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Errant+Ephemeron)
  
**[Errant Ephemeron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron)** – *Modern Masters* common. While it certainly might look like "Ephemeron" is a name created by modifying the ending of "[ephemera](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ephemera)" (that is, something with no lasting significance), the word itself is in English as [something short-lived or transitory](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ephemeron). Given that our *Errant Ephemeron* here is an Illusion, that makes sense! 
 


![Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reveillark)
  
**[Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark)** – *Modern Masters* rare. This card's name is made up of the words "[réveil](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/r%C3%A9veil)" (French for "awakening," from which we get our word "[reveille](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reveille)") and "[lark](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lark?show=0&t=1370905992)" (being both a bird and a source of harmless fun, hence the flying and the bright art containing feathery wings). 
 


![247533](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=247533)
  
**[Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring)** – ***Magic: The Gathering**—Commander*  uncommon. There are many (well, [fourteen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&type=+%5B%22Artifact%22%5D&name=+%5Bring%5D%7C%5B%27s%5D%7C%5Bsol%5D%7C%5Bof%5D)) magic rings in this game, and none of them should be used lightly! The popular [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring) was the first—and for a few months, only—magic ring in **Magic**, until *Arabian Nights* introduced [three more](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=%5B%22Arabian+Nights%22%5D&name=+%5BRing%5D). It has been printed and reprinted the second-most number of times (seven) of any ring, behind only [Aladdin's Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aladdin%27s+Ring) (eight). 
 


![Adarkar Valkyrie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Adarkar+Valkyrie)
  
**[Adarkar Valkyrie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Valkyrie)** – *Modern Masters* rare. You likely already know that a [Valkyrie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie) is a usually semi-divine woman of Norse and Germanic mythology who decides who lives and dies in battle. But just in case you didn't, now you do! As her flavor text indicates, **Magic**'s only Valkyrie (originally appearing in *Coldsnap*) has a slightly different job. 
 


![Slumbering Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Slumbering+Dragon)
  
**[Slumbering Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slumbering+Dragon)** – *Magic 2013* rare. The idea of the sleeping dragon is a pretty common fantasy motif, but whence did it originate? Translations of the phrase "sleeping dragon" go back at least to Ancient China, and refer there to [a chancellor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Liang) and [a dinosaur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mei_long). Albanian myth gave us [Bolla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolla), who sleeps all but one day a year. But it seems likely that our modern concept comes from "a most specially greedy, strong and wicked [worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smaug)." 
 


![Duergar Cave-Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Duergar+Cave-Guard)
  
**[Duergar Cave-Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duergar+Cave-Guard)** – *Eventide* uncommon. This not-so-little guy has a form of the "firebreathing" ability, so-called because it appears on the card, well, [Firebreathing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebreathing). There are [sixty-ish cards in **Magic**](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?page=1&action=advanced&text=+%5Bgets%5D+%5B+1/+0%5D+%5Buntil%5D+!%5B%7B1%7D%5D+!%5B%7B2%7D%5D+!%5B%7B3%7D%5D+!%5B%7BB%7D%7BR%7D%5D%7C%5B%7BR%7D:%5D) that have or grant true firebreathing, and also sixty-ish cards (weird) that grant [a variation thereof](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&text=+%5Bgets%5D+%5B+1/+0%5D+%5Buntil%5D+%5B:%5D+!%5B%7BR%7D:%5D). 
 


![Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice)
  
**[Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice)** – *Modern Masters* mythic rare. There are  [sixteen **Magic** swords](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Bsword%5D&type=%7C%5B%22Artifact%22%5D%7C%5B%22Enchantment%22%5D)  (seventeen if you count [Wall of Swords](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Swords)), fifteen of which are artifacts. Before the Equipment subtype was created (in the *Mirrodin* block, whence also came the original [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice)), the idea was approximated by having artifact swords tap to grant their abilities to other creatures. 
 
![Sarkhan Vol](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/mma/makakxioolww/PjbzrsAMQh_EN.jpg)  
**[Sarkhan Vol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol)** – *Modern Masters* rare. This not-mad version of [Sarkhan Vol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol) first appeared in *Shards of Alara*.
