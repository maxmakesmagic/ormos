There are just three tokens and one emblem to be found in *Aether Revolt* packs, but man are they great. Since the [full set is already live](/node/1108031), let's dive right in.


First up is the emblem from one Tezzeret the Schemer. If you set this scheme in motion, your opponent likely isn't long for the world.

And while we're on the topic of Tezzeret the Schemer, how about the Etherium Cell he's capable of producing?

That leaves just two tokens, and both are red. One is the most adorable token we've printed in some time. Well actually, both are pretty adorableâ€”the Gremlin and the legendary Monkey Ragavan!

All of these tokens will be available in packs as early as next week when the [*Aether Revolt* Prereleases](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/prerelease-events-types-events) kick off all around the world!
