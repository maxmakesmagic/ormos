The Nantuko are a race of wise, mantis-like creatures from the *Odyssey* block. Spiritually close to nature, they are druids by profession. Today's Magic Arcana takes a behind-the-scenes look at the Nantuko chapter of the *Odyssey* style guide, to see what the artist illustrating these Insect Druids saw when the cards were still being designed.

To the right is a close-up concept illustration of a male Nantuko's head features. The caption reads: 


> 
> *"Male shaman/elder  
>  Older males grow chin and nostril tendrils as they age"*
> 

 Don't chuckle: nothing makes an older mantis look more distinguished than long nostril tendrils! 
  Below is a diagram of the morphological differences between male and female Nantuko.



 And here are some sketchbook concepts of some Nantuko bone weapons and armor.
