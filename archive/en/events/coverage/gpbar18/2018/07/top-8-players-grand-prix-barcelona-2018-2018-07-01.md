**Name:** Javier Dominguez


**Age:** 31

**Hometown:** Palau de Plemagans, Spain


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


One Pro Tour Top 8, second at Worlds 2017, two Grand Prix wins out of seven Top 8s.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Jeskai. I wanted to beat Humans.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Search for Azcanta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta). It plays very well with 1-mana spells.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). Useful against so many decks.

**Name:** Pierre Dagen


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Consulting associate


**Hometown:** Paris, France


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Three GP Top 8s, two PT Top 8s, third at World *Magic* Cup 2015, two-time national champion, tricked Marc Tobiasch and Oliver Polak-Rottmann into teaming with me.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


White-Blue Control, I think I play it well and it is always relevant in any metagame.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Teferi, Hero of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Hero+of+Dominaria). He does exactly what a win condition should.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Baneslayer Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel), because Immanuel Gerschenson found it and I like him.

**Name:** Louis Deltour


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** *Magic* player?


**Hometown:** Paris, France


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Four other GP Top 8s, French Nationals Top 4.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


KCI. I love playing combo decks and I felt like the field would still be unprepared.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks).


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast). Won every time I drew it.

**Name:** Nick Waugh


**Age:** 29


**Occupation:** Business development manager


**Hometown:** Godalming, United Kingdom


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


One Pro Point from GP Lille in February, some close calls for Top 8s at RPTQs and WMCQs.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Burn, my go-to deck. It suits my playstyle, rewards the things I'm good at in *Magic*, and doesn't force me to use skills I'm not so hot at.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


I'm going to say [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel). In so many matchups it's absolutely back-breaking- It's like having a sideboard card in your deck game one.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


Probably [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace). It let me play on easy mode against Ironworks combo for the Top 8 berth! Honourable mention to [Deflecting Palm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm) for some blowouts against Humans on Day 1.

**Age:** 33


**Occupation:** IT support

**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


I played a lot. Got two to three Top 64s in many years.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


White-Blue Miracles; the missing cards were cheap.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements), punishing all the burn decks.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


No idea. My sideboard is boring.

[Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting). Provides both explosiveness and consistency.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge). So much value from just one sideboard slot.

[Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow), the card is busted.

[Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope). I faced many control decks.
