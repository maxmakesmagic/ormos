Welcome back to another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. We're in the middle of our final quiet period in this extended season that stretches all the way back to May 2013, and a Grand Prix in [Guadalajara, Mexico](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpgua13/welcome). Now, three events remain, and by the end of them we will know the identity of all the World *Magic* Cup captains for the 72 competing countries for Worlds Week. We will know the identity of the 24 players who will compete for the World Championship, also taking place in Nice, France, this coming December. Most importantly, we will know the identity of the Player of the Year, the highest accolade in the game. So, as the clock runs down, who is in prime position to turn rankings excellence into trophies, cold hard cash, and a seat at the World Championship?




In the rankings, No. 1 Reid Duke and No. 2 Jérémy Dezani are separated by fractions, and in the Player of the Year race it's also ridiculously tight. Both players are likely to take on the Modern format at Grand Prix Boston-Worcester, and Dezani will be looking to keep Duke 1 point behind him as they head, along with all the world's best, for Pro Tour *Magic 2015* in Portland, Oregon. The same weekend as the Modern GP in North America, Chinese Taipei plays host to the last Asia-Pacific Grand Prix of the season, with a last-minute chance for Pros to practice the new *Magic 2015* Draft format.



Wherever Pros choose to hone their skills in the last weekend in July, everything is going to come down to the Pro Tour the following week. Join us next week as we continue the countdown toward the busiest weekend of the *Magic* year, with the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
