 Over here in the other semifinal, Nico Bohny of Switzerland met Slovak Ivan Floch. At 26 Pro Points and not qualified for the upcoming Pro Tour, Bohny wasn't really playing for anything beyond the fun, the fame and the glory. Quite unlike Floch who was at 27 points before this Grand Prix and was very much looking to make it to 35 at Pro Tour *Magic 2015*.



Bohny had drafted a somwhat clunky blue-green deck with a tiny splash of red. Floch had drafted a black-white deck which was aggressive in theory but needed to make use of quite a lot of filler cards to fill out its curve.
