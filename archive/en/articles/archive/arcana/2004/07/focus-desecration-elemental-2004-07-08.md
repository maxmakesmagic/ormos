Demons don't have to have all the fun - there are plenty of other large black creatures in **Magic** with bad attitudes.

Take **[Desecration Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Elemental)** for example. You can see from the card text that it's an 8/8 Fear for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif). But take a closer look at the art by Pete Venters, and you can see the horrible truth of what this creature actually does.

It's a bloated entity with tendrils of ooze that animates corpses like puppets. It's shown here animating what look to be the remains of a leonin and a human.

Well, okay, around a [Desecration Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Elemental), I guess nothing is.
