**Upcoming *Kaladesh*-*Aether Revolt* Sealed PTQ on Sunday, February 12**


Attention all Pro Tour hopefuls: a Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) is approaching! The *Kaladesh*-*Aether Revolt* Sealed Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries begin Thursday, February 9, and run through Tuesday, February 14. We hope to see you in the PTQ Finals on Sunday, February 12!


Remember, you are no longer required to enter into the PTQ Finals immediately following the Preliminary that you qualified through, thanks to the redesigned PTQ system that *Magic Online* Events Manager Lee Sharpe announced [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-qualifier-changes-2015-11-16).
