**Important Changes Coming with *Oath of the Gatewatch* on January 27**


To support the *Oath of the Gatewatch* release next week, *Magic Online* had to make some changes to the entire system that governs paying mana costs (watch for Alli Medwin’s R&D article next week). As a result, there are two major changes players need to be aware of.


First, adding mana to the mana pool prior to selecting a spell to cast or activating an ability will require players to manually select the mana in the mana pool to fulfill generic mana requirements, as this mana will no longer be auto-consumed as players might be used to. While we hope to improve this process with a future update, players can avoid the extra clicks this change causes by selecting the spell or ability first and then tapping their lands to pay the mana cost. Animations showing what these changes will look like, alongside step-by-step directions, can be found below.


Second, this change affects the accuracy of all replays captured prior to the change. Since they will no longer be accurate, all replays will be permanently deleted during the downtime. Players who have replays they want to view should make sure to do so prior to the downtime or use another method, such as screen capture software, to record games they wish to save.


**Tapping for mana, then casting a spell:**


* The player taps for two red and one blue mana.
* With that mana floating, the player casts [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts).
* The red floating mana must then be selected to designate that it's paying the generic mana required to cast [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts).

**Casting a spell, then tapping for mana:**


* The player selects a spell they would like to cast, [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts).
* Using any combination of lands, the player then generates enough mana to cast [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts). In this example, the player taps one Island and two Mountains.
* Mana is automatically consumed and [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts) is cast.
