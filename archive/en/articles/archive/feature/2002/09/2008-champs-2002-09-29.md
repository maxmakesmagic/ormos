![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/2007/champs.jpg) Wizards of the Coast has decided to revamp our Organized Play offerings in 2008 in order to make **Magic**  available to the most players possible. We are redesigning the States/Champs programs for both the Two-Headed Giant and Standard formats. As such we will not be running the 2HG States/Champs event normally run in March or the Standard event that takes place in the fall. The 2HG events previously scheduled for Great Britain and Ireland will still take place. We thank you for your continued support and look forward to having a new invigorated program for you later this year.

We are excited about the changes in our programs this year, and hope that you will check out **[www.magicthegathering.com](http://www.magicthegathering.com)**  for news about the new programs and outlets through 2008 and beyond.
