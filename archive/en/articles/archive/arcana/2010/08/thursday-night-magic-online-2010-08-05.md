Well, guess what? You could be playing **Magic** right now! Probably! Depending on when you read this!

Now, when we say Thursday "Night" **Magic**, we are aware that the planet is spherical. So events are very Thursday at 10:00 AM PDT (17:00 UTC), 3:00 PM PDT (22:00 UTC), and 8:00 PM PDT (Friday 3:00 UTC). That way, you ought to be able to play on Thursday evening almost no matter where you are! And if you want to secretly playon Thursday afternoon or something, we promise not to tell anyone.
