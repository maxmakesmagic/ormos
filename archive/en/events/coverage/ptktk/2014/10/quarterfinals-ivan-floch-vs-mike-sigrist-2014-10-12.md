When 5th-ranked Ivan Floch sat down at the table for the third Quarterfinal match of the day, he wasn't just chasing his second consecutive Pro Tour title. He was chasing history.



 Only one player in the history of *Magic* has won back-to-back Pro Tours, and that was back in 2001 by "German Juggernaut" and hall of famer Kai Budde.



He's a big deal. You may have heard of him.



 But Floch had the opportunity to do just that on Sunday in Honolulu after being crowned champion at Pro Tour *Magic 2015*. His Blue-Black Control deck was one of the more unique in the tournament, eschewing the main-deck [Pearl Lake Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Lake+Ancient) and instead using four copies of [Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx) as his finisher of choice. It's a deck that excels against the Abzan decks that were heavily represented in the tournament.




 His opponent, Mike Sigrist, was one of those playing Abzan. But Sigrist, fresh off a win at Grand Prix Washington D.C. a few months ago (where he beat fellow Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* Top 8 member Yuuya Watanabe in the finals), wasn't playing the midrange variant that most people had chosen. Instead, Sigrist was running an aggressive list making use of [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer), and [Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment). Unlike the slower builds of the deck, Sigrist's had the ability to play resilient threats before the control decks had time to set up, which forced them to choose between using a removal spell or keeping up a counterspell mana.



It was enough to give Sigrist's deck an edge against much of the field, and Floch knew going in that he was an underdog.


"We practiced the match last night. I was winning 30 percent of the games," Floch admitted sheepishly before the match.




*5th-ranked Ivan Floch knew his Quarterfinals match against Mike Sigrist was going to be tough to win his way out of. But the Pro Tour winner was ready to put up a fight.*
