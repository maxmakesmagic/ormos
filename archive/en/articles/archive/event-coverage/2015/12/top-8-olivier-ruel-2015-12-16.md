Q: What made you decide to come to Grand Prix Porto?  

A: The reputation of Portuguese Magicians and the fact I'm still on holidays.



Q: What were your expectations going into this tournament, and why?  

A: Being in Top 8 to qualify for PTLA and prepare well for PTNY.



Q: Briefly describe your tournament play-wise so far, both day one and day two.  

A: Day one; three byes, win against Dominik Hothow, lost against Noah Boeken, then two wins against less good players. Finished 10th. Day two; 1-1-1 in my first draft, then win with much luck a table with Levy, Maher... Finished at 7th place.



Q: What do you think is the main reason for you making top 8 in this tournament, and why?  

A: My three byes, the help of Levy who was on my left during the last draft, and of course much luck.



Q: What does this top 8 performance mean to you?  

A: A great accomplishment for me and my brother who were only considered as team Black Ops, the luckies team in the world (even if it is true).



Q: What are your predictions for the top 8?  

A: I beat my brother 3-2 in the finals, with five topdecks in a row.
