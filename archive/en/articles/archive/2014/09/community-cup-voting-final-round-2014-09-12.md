The [2014 Community Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/2014-community-cup-player-profiles-2014-08-18) is finally here and, while I can't speak for the Community team, the Wizards of the Coast team has been dutifully preparing to crush honorably battle against the players traveling to Renton September 12-14.


But we don't want to give the home team too much of an advantage. After all, we get to pick the formats, and that hardly seems fair. So, in the spirit of the Community Cup, we're going to let you, the community, help choose the makeup of the Sealed format! As an added bonus, companion events running the same set of boosters will be available on *Magic Online*.


Here's how it works. You’ll be able to get your vote on with the 2014 Community Cup Companion Events, a series of Sealed events using boosters from sets that are voted upon by you right here on DailyMTG. All of the votes will stay open for 24 hours, and each one will pick a different pack for the eight-pack Sealed event.


The final vote is today, which also happens to be the first day of the Community Cup! Vote for your favorite pack, or even just one you think would be funny to throw into the plans of everyone involved. However you vote, the pack with the highest vote will be added to the Sealed event at the Community Cup *and* for the [companion events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/2014-community-cup-companion-events-2014-08-26) held at the same time. You can only vote once, so make sure it's a good one.
