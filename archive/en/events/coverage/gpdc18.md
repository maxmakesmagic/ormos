Day 1 Coverage



Welcome to Day 1 of GP Washington DC! It's an unusual second Team Limited event for *Dominaria*, and the last GP to feed into the hallmark team event of the season, Pro Tour 25th Anniversary.


With Pro Tour *Dominaria* just a week away in nearby Richmond, Virginia, the field is stacked with juggernaut (not [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=443110)) players from all over the world forming daunting pro teams like Black/Severa/Hron, two-thirds of the winning team from GP Washington DC 2016, Damo Da Rosa/Froehlich/Stark, all members of the Hall of Fame, Floch/Hendricks/Larsson, a team of two PT winners, the international talent amalgamation of Jůza/Nakamura/Burkhart, and the classic Turtenwald/Jensen/Duke, winners of two team GPs and in the Top 4 of five others.


Over 500 teams pack the Dulles Expo Center, eager to see what their *Dominaria* boosters and the rounds ahead of them hold. Legends live again as Karn, Jhoira, Teferi, Squee, and more battle their way through the Grand Prix, bringing their literally timeless amounts of experience to bear on the multiverse.
