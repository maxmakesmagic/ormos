Showcase Qualifiers
-------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events. MOCS is a set of linked tournaments designed to highlight the game's best players each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and an invitation to an upcoming Championship on *MTG Arena*.

**NOTES**:


* Each event in *Magic Online* has a maximum number of players *(as indicated below)* and events at the end of each season are likely to have more players. Once an event fills, no further entries will be allowed, so plan your QP usage accordingly.
* Players must be at least age 13 to play *Magic Online*. Players under age 18 on the date of the qualifying event are permitted to win digital prizes but are ineligible to be awarded invitations to Championships or the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase.
* Players already invited to the next Championship remain eligible to compete in Qualifiers, Super Qualifiers, and Champions Showcase events except as noted below.
* Should an already invited or ineligible player win a redundant Championship invitation, that invite will pass down to the next highest placed eligible player.
