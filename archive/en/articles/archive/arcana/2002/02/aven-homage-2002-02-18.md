Sometimes cards are reprinted without being actual "reprints;" the new cards have the same functionality as the old ones, but different names. (Meaning you could use four of each in a deck.)

Two of *Odyssey*'s Aven are just such cards. [Aven Cloudchaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser) and [Aven Fisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher) are descended from *Tempest*'s [Cloudchaser Eagle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudchaser+Eagle) and *Urza's Destiny*'s [Kingfisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kingfisher), respectively. Both new cards pay homage to the old ones not only in name, but also subtly in their art (the speared fish being the most obvious link).
