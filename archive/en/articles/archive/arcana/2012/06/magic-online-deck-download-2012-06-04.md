This week, Monty's off on a boat ~~stranded in the ocean~~ cruising toward Alaska, so I've been left to mind the Arcana for the week. Today I'm going to point out a nifty new (old) feature for the decklists you see on **Wizards.com**!

You can now easily download any decklist for use on **Magic Online**!

When you look at a deck, you'll notice a new icon in the top right corner.

If you click on that icon you'll download a text file, which can be imported into **Magic Online**. The key to the import is that when you go to load the decklist, you need to choose the "Local Text Deck" option in the dropdown, as seen here:

Then if you have all the cards needed, you're all set!

The only time you won't see this icon is when we share a deck that contains cards not yet on **Magic Online**, such as during previews.
