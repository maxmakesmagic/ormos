Troy, Il.


S: How long have you been playing?


Four years.


S: How long have you been playing competitively?


Three and half years. 


S: What are your best tournament accomplishments?


Plenty of wins locally, third place PTQ finish last year, today.


S: What are you playing and why?


Draw-go with Magpie. With Foil and Thwart to protect Magpie/survive early, you make up the advantage late and win.


S: How does it stack up against the field?


Lots of Angry Hermit, which is a hard matchup.
