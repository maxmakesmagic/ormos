 Yichao is a writer of words for plays, television, theme parks, and—most recently—Magic: The Gathering. He loves Cube Draft and corgis. 






One of the biggest challenges for the artists of *Magic* is creating compositions that look great even on the small scale of a card. Many artists squeeze an incredible amount of detail into their work, some of which doesn't always get noticed at first glance.


Can you recognize the cards below by just their close-ups? There's a lot happening in these cards, and the art reflects that—often with little hidden gems in the background. How well do you know your *BFZ* art?
