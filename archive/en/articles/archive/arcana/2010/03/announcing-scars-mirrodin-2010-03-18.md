Standard now rotates only once each year, with the release of the October large set. So *Scars of Mirrodin* will enter Standard on its release and *Shards of Alara* block and ***Magic** 2010* will leave. The Standard format after the release of *Scars of Mirrodin* will consist of *Zendikar* Block, ***Magic** 2011*, and *Scars of Mirrodin*.
