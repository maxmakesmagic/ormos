From time to time, we like to show you Alpha playtest cards and let you guess what card they turned into. This time, we're doing something a little different. We've got playtest cards that *didn't become cards at all*! That's right, we're showing you shocking images from a future that never was. Behold!

Neat, eh? And now it's time for another installment of everyone's favorite Arcana Subfeature, Core Set Survivor!


**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, only *eight* cards will have been in every core set. Over the weeks before the ***Magic** 2010* prerelease, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth).
