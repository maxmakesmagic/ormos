He has already won two Grand Prix in China, so I'd say he is a strong contender."

Zhang Zhiyang is one of China's finest players, with three Grand Prix Top 8s and a World Team Champion title under his belt. This makes him one of the most decorated Chinese players in the room today. At a 6-2 record, he would need to win his last match to advance further.


However, Yuuya Watanabe is in his way. A major roadblock, considering Watanabe's daunting resume. Twenty one Grand Prix Top 8s. Seven wins. He is hunting for his eighth. He has already won two Grand Prix in China, so I'd say he is a strong contender.


Game 1
======



 Zhang found his opening seven unsatisfactory and went down to 6, but that didnt stop him from recruiting [Watcher of the Roost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watcher+of+the+Roost), a morph and [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief).




 Watanabe wasn't to be outdone, quickly summoning three morphs, [Alabaster Kirin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Kirin) and [Abzan Battle Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Battle+Priest), growing it to a 5/4 lifelink creature in just two turns.




 Watanabe made use of the window that Zhang was tapped out to destroy [Mardu Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hordechief) with [Rite of the Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+the+Serpent) and attacked with his entire team. Zhang pushed two creatures in the way of the 5/4 lifelinking creature and used his morph to block one of three Watanabe's morphs.




 The reason for Watanabe's aggressive trading was immediately obvious. After the bloodbath, he used the cards in his graveyard to pay for [Shambling Attendants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Attendants) and then [Sultai Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Scavenger). Zhang was unable to recover from the speed and reached for the sideboard.





*Yuuya Watanabe delves his way to victory.*
