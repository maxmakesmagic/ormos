On March 20, we'll be revealing the full contents of *Duel Decks: Mind vs. Might*, but given the preview fever the community has had lately, why not a little peek? Just a bit?


Here's what I'll give you this week. First, this is what the packaging looks like:

Those two face cards? Well, rather than squinting and enhancing, how about I just show them to you?

And, when you pick up the latest incarnation of *Duel Decks*, you'll also get these cool deck boxes to store the decks after mightily tearing through the packaging.
