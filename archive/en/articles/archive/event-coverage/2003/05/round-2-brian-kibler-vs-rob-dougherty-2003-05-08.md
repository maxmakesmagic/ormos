![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a384.jpg)Kibler is running [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) today, and while shuffling was talking about how no one really tested for his deck. As it turns out, a few players are playing [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), and sideboard cards devoted to beating it are certainly not plentiful. Dougherty is running his signature Reanimator deck.

### Game 1

Kibler played [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), and Dougherty cast [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), which missed. [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) was used on Dougherty's upkeep, and on the next turn he cast [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) to get [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force). [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) brought it out, putting a significant amount of pressure on the board. [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) gave Kibler a decent way to handle the 7/7, although it would tie up his mana.

A Saproling was sacrificed to flash back Therapy, and Dougherty guessed [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). He saw Kibler's hand, which was [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker). [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) attacked for four damage, and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) turned [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) into [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo). With another Key in play, this gave Kibler more mana to work with under the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore)- he would need it with only one card in his hand. 

Dougherty cast another [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) on end step, while [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) shot down all the Saprolings. [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) put [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) into the graveyard, and [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) brought it into play, taking out [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) traded [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) for another [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), and Kibler had just enough mana to shoot down [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher). Kibler still only had one card in hand, but it was a good one- [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius). Suddenly he was up six cards, and was able to keep both his [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore)s alive by discarding two cards.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a386.jpg)[Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) brought back [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher), taking out one of the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore)s. Kibler only had one mana up and was at two life, so he was forced to chump block [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) with [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) got a big laugh out of Dougherty, as it put [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) into play after it resolved and bounced the [Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher). Thanks to that and two [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port)s, Kibler was able to win the game.

Kibler- 1 Dougherty- 0

Kibler talked about how he had [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) in hand earlier in the game, and didn't cast it.

Kibler- "That made me at least think that you couldn't possibly [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) me for [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), since playing [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) was the right play."

Dougherty- "I was thinking that was either moronic or pure genius."

Kibler- "I'm going with pure genius."

### Game 2

Kibler started off with [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal), and had Port turn two. [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) followed, putting Dougherty into a very bad position. He played [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) on end step to get [Nether Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Spirit), which came right into play on upkeep. A second [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) put [Woodripper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodripper) into the graveyard. Kibler simply played [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), and ended his turn. [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) put [Woodripper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodripper) into play, and it destroyed [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) and [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo); [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal) bounced it back.

[Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) named [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), and Dougherty saw [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal), [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) and [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). [Nether Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Spirit) was sacrificed to flash it back, taking care of the Seal. Kibler summoned [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), which died to [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict). [Phyrexian Negator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator) gave Dougherty a significant clock, while Kibler played [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), and the Spirit and Negator attacked for seven. Kibler floated mana, casting [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo), [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) and [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) followed, while Dougherty had no permanents in play. [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) and [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) had Dougherty's resources tied up, but he was still able to squeeze through [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) and [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)[Woodripper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodripper). It decimated Kibler's side, and a pair of Negators came out a few turns later to finish the job.

Kibler- 1 Dougherty- 1

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a385.jpg)Kibler mulliganed his opening hand, and opened with [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). Dougherty named [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) with [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), and saw two lands, Dynamo and [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). Dynamo came out on the following turn, island buried the City, and [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal) gave Kibler a good insurance policy. [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) stripped away [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), leaving Kibler with only an island in hand. He drew, shrugged, and cast the [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) he topdecked, getting [Phyrexian Processor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor). It was set to ten, and made a token immediately. [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) killed it off, and Kibler played [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key).

[Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) killed the next token, but it was obviously an uphill battle. The [Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher) chump blocked a 10/10, and Kibler played [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal). Dougherty cast [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) to get [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), which put a [Woodripper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodripper) into the graveyard. It was [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d, and took out the Dynamo and Processor, but not before it could make a second 10/10. [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal) bounced the [Woodripper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodripper), and the 10/10's came in for the win.

Kibler- "It's the same strategy as in 2000. If they deal with the Processor, they probably can't deal with 10/10 creatures."

**Final Result:** Kibler- 2 Dougherty- 1
