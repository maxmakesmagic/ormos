Welcome back to another edition of Sketches! Today we're looking at one of the pieces of art that gives *Innistrad* its creepy atmosphere: Peter Mohrbacher's Ghost Quarter.

### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Peter Mohrbacher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Peter%20Mohrbacher%22%5D) is fairly new to **Magic** illustrations. He's done two cards prior to *Innistrad*: [Animar, Soul of Elements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animar%2C+Soul+of+Elements) from ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* and an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244326) from ***Magic** 2012*. And he's got six pieces in *Innistrad*!

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions Peter was given for the card:


> 
>  Action: Show a deserted street of a small town at night under the full, giant moon. The buildings are decaying and broken down. Weeds show though the cobblestones and moss grows on the walls/foundations. A thick blanket of swirling fog hovers a few feet off the ground. This is ghostly energy that lingers in the deserted town. Maybe glimpses of faces can be seen in the fog. 
> 
> 
> Focus: The creepy place. 
> 
> 
> Mood: A literal ghost town. 
> 
> 
> 

### Sketches

With that art description to work with, Peter submitted a sketch to the **Magic** creative team:

The creative team suggested that the town would be creepier and more "Ghost Town"-y if the wagon's axle were broken. Peter took that note and went to work on the final version.
