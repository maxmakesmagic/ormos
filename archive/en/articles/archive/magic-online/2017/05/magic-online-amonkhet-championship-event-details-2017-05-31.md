Magic Online Amonkhet Championships and Constructed PTQ Changes

**Constructed PTQ Changes**


The original system of Pro Tour Qualifiers on *Magic Online* were single tournaments that all players could join. Unfortunately, these events became too big and resulted in unpleasant player experiences. To resolve this, we split them into 5-round preliminary events, and finals events that could be joined by earning 4 or more wins in a finals.


As we have examined this system, it is clear that for limited qualifiers, this system is still necessary. However, we believe constructed can succeed under the old system as a single large event. While these events will be larger and longer than finals today, it won’t require a preliminary and so players can get through the qualification in a single day.


We’ll be transitioning to this system as follows:


* The June 3 Standard PTQ Finals will be the last one you can’t use Event Tickets or Play Points to join.
* After June 3, we will no longer be running Constructed PTQ Preliminaries.
* During the June 14 downtime, as previously scheduled, Red PTQ Finals Tokens will expire and be cleared from accounts.
* Starting with the Modern PTQ Finals on June 18, Constructed PTQ Finals will accept 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points to join. If you have a Constructed Blue PTQ Finals token, you can use it to join as well (until they expire after the qualification season for Pro Tour *Ixalan*).
* Currently, PTQ Finals award PTQ Finals Tokens for 2nd-8th place finishers. For Constructed PTQ Finals, this prize will be changed to 300 Play Points. Limited PTQ Finals will continue to award PTQ Finals Tokens to 2nd-8th place finishers.

We hope constructed players enjoy now only needing to play on a single day to try to qualify for the Pro Tour!
