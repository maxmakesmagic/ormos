**Terry Tsang vs Jeff Fung**



This feature match promised to be an extremely aggressive and fast match-up, due to Tsang's deck having a huge amount of burn. His deck was designed to win, and win quickly. Fung's deck was a more conservative U/W deck designed to take control of the long game, but with Tsang's speed, the short game promised to be much more important.



**Game 1**



Fung starts quickly with a Veiled Sentry and Expendable Troops by 2nd turn, only to see the troops die to Tsang's Scent of Cinder. Fung kept up the pressure playing a Pegasus Charger and Serra Advocate on turns 3 and 4 while Tsang played a Ghitu Fire-Eater and a Cinder Seer, trying to keep up. On the 5th turn however, Fung proved that he had the answer by playing Disappear on Tsang's Seer and returning it to his hand. Every turn thereafter, Fung would send the Seer back to Tsang's hand with a taunting grin, stating "Capsize that!". Tsang lost shortly therafter. 



Tsang 0 - Fung 1



**Game 2**



Tsang started this game off with a bang, playing creatures on turns 2, 3 and 4 while Fung played only an Expendable Troops and was forced to cycle his Veiled Serpent, looking for an answer to Tsang's Swine. Finding the answer in the form of a Pendrell Flux and then a Capistan Knight, he followed it up with a Pegasus Charger. Meanwhile, Tsang had played out a Cinder Seer, which had remained harmless for 2 turns. On his next turn, Fung played Disappear on the Seer, but lacked the extra blue mana to activate it. At the end of Fung's turn, Tsang activated the Seer, revealing 4 cards in his hand: Ghitu Fire Eater, Reckless Abandon, Flame Jet and Lava Axe. On his turn, Tsang cast Multani's Decree, destroying the Disappear and crushing Fung's last hope. Fung conceeded immediately. 



**Tsang 1 - Fung 1**



Game 3



This game saw Fung mulliganing and stalling out at 1 land. Tsang played Pygmy Pyrosaur, Goblin Patrol and Cinder Seer on turns 2, 3 and 4. On his 4th turn, Fung managed to find a 2nd land and summoned a Capistan Knight only to see Tsang used his Cinder Seer on it at the end of turn. The next turn Tsang cast Scald and Fung extended his hand.
