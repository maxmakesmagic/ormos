Comments:


One of my transformative experiences playing Magic was piloting a mono-blue storm combo deck. I wanted to capture some of that feeling of casting a bunch of small spells to build up to some reward with Develop, blue's version of the Evolve mechanic. Flavor-wise, it represents species adapting to the constant presence of magic spells being cast by the Planeswalkers who are meddling with Epolith's development.


At this point, my thinking is that each color will have a separate ability word representing a unique trigger that adds +1/+1 counters. Later sets in the block will keep the same ability words and triggers in each color, but have other abilities, as giant dinosaurs will be extinct or in decline by then.


All of these +1/+1 counters and giant dinosaurs suggested that power should matter in other ways, hence the Preeminence keyword. My thought is that if "X" is always "your most powerful creature's power," it should be easier to get a handle on.


I explored some other evolutionarily-themed mechanics. Two cards tell the stories of fish evolving into reptiles, and reptiles into birds, respectively.


Common artifacts will be essential to show the progression from the Stone Age in the first set to the Bronze Age and Iron Age in the subsequent sets. An artifact subtheme like the Equipment subtheme in Zendikar will help this along.
