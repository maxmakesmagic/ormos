Modern Cube Continues
---------------------


Modern Cube is up and running, and it's a great way to try out all the iconic cards and synergies that shape one of *Magic*'s most dynamic formats—in as many different forms as you can draft. Modern Cube can be found in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby and will run through April 20.

*Dominaria* Is Coming to *Magic Online*
---------------------------------------



*Magic*'s legendary home plane will hit *Magic Online* on Friday, April 20, bringing with it lots of fun events and even more epic history. For all the details, watch this site for an article by Lee Sharpe tomorrow, April 11!



MOCS Open April 15

A *Magic Online* Championship Series Open event will take place this Sunday, April 15, at 7 a.m. PT (-7 for UTC). The format will be *Rivals of Ixalan*-*Ixalan* Sealed Deck. MOCS Open events do not require an invitation or Qualifier Points to join—simply join this event with 40 Event Tickets or 400 Play Points. The winner qualifies for the *Magic Online* Championship, a Pro Tour, and the Pro Tour Challenge event at that Pro Tour.
