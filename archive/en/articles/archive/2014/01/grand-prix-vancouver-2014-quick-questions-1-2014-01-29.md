### What card are people playing in Standard that they shouldn't be?

Because of the open metagame, there are so many angles of attack to be ready for. It's just too much to ask from a control deck to have the right answers.*

[Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) and [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) are everywhere, and you almost never get value the turn you play it. You don't want to play cards that let your opponents decide if they want to deal with them.*

It's only good against fringe decks, and the White Weenie deck only wins when it has good starts. You can't play cards that are bad in your opening hand.*

It's so bad because of [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall). I wish I could play it this weekend. I'd much rather play a deck like that.*

One mana for Scry 1 just isn't and efficient trade. If you're a blue-white deck, play more [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination)s.*
