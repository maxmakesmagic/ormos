These two players know each other very well. They are both French, and have played a lot of Pro Tours and Grand Prix together.

The game started as it often does in this format: [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)-go, [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)-go. Levy then used a [Dimir Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Signet) to play a turn three [Moroii](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moroii) and a turn four [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede), showing all kinds of lands except [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s. Hamon was forced to take a few hits, but could trade the insect for one of his own. However, his black-green-white deck couldn't provide an answer to the vampire in time, and he had to concede in turn seven.


1-0 Levy


Yann chose to play in Game 2, and again the players opened with a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) on each side. They spent a few turns building their armies. Hamon's [Vitu-Ghazi, the City-Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitu-Ghazi%2C+the+City-Tree) made this a little easier for him, but he had to limit its use, as his [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage) was very hungry for mana. Levy got a little damage in with the only flyer on the table, [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake), while Hamon used the Guildmage to force a [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) through once in a while. Levy proved to be quite a token-master himself, as [Fists of Ironwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) on [Bramble Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental) provided a burst of saprolings - much need chump blockers on the ground. When he got his [Cerulean Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Sphinx) into play, the game quickly ended.


Raphael Levy beat Yann Hamon, 2-0
