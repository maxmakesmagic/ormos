Hello, everyone!


I'm Jess Dunks, the new rules manager for *Magic*. I'm excited to welcome you to the first day of classes and, along with it, my first update bulletin! This will give you an initial look and brief explanation of the rules changes and card updates that are occurring for *Strixhaven: School of Mages*. Once they're live, you can check them out on the [rules page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) and in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/). Let's get started!
