A Shift in Standard

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






I went hunting for new ideas at a Pro Tour Qualifier this last weekend. I was happy to see that Standard has become a significantly more diverse and fun format in the past few weeks. I saw a number of [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) variants, a Glissa deck, and a brand new deck from the talented up-and-comer Jonathan Sukenik.

Many know Jonathan as Watchwolf on **Magic Online**. He's known for playing very original brews in all formats with a great deal of success. This past weekend, Jonathan was playing something that no one expected.

[Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift) is a card that was a lot of fun to build your Limited deck around, but I doubt anyone ever thought it would find its way into a competitive deck. I became even more excited, though, when I learned that Jonathan made the top four of the (roughly) 180-player event.

![Gravitational Shift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gravitational+Shift)  
Jonathan's exact list is still a mystery to me, but I'd like to try to build a deck that abuses the overlooked rare enchantment from *Rise of the Eldrazi*. A lot of players have asked me to make the decks more budget-friendly than they have been recently, so I'm going to try to keep this deck under the 40-ticket mark on **Magic Online**.

[Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift) has many applications in the current Standard format. The first thing you'll notice is that it beats the Vampire deck outright. Once you've landed the enchantment, they can only beat you by using [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) in conjunction with [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn). [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift) also interacts very well against [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo decks. It's fine if your opponent makes a million -1/4s. Against most other decks it completely neuters their offense while massively buffing your own.

Watchwolf chose the blue black route. He had cards like [Abyssal Persecutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Persecutor) and [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) in his deck. I decided to stick with the blue-black route and make a more budget version of Jon's deck.

Black has some nice flyers and it provides excellent spot removal and discard spells. [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) is probably my favorite of the bunch. It does exactly what you need your cards to do. It's excellent against aggressive decks, and it provides a great threat against the more controlling strategies of the metagame.

![Vampire Nighthawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vampire+Nighthawk)  
[Liliana's Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter) is another fine inclusion for a deck like this. It combos nicely with our [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift) and it helps with the card advantage war. This is another card that's very strong that hasn't had a chance to shine since it was printed in ***Magic** 2011*.

![Liliana's Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Liliana%27s+Specter)  
I noticed a lot of Titans and [Swords of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) when I was walking around the PTQ. This made me feel that [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) may be a good card again. It works very well against the two most popular win conditions of the format. Remember to save a spot removal spell for [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) in the sideboard, though, as [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) looks pretty miserable when it's staring at a [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite).

![Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tumble+Magnet)  
I'm already playing [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet), and I wanted to play [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) to help ramp myself into the top end of my deck. This seems like an excellent opportunity to cast some [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird)s. [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird) is a pretty reasonable clock when combined with [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift). The fact that [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird) charges up the [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s and [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice)s on top of that is pretty huge.

| Everflowing Chalice | Thrummingbird |

I wanted some really juicy win condition that worked especially well with [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift). [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly) with [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift) is about as fun as things get. You'll have 15 points of power spread over five fliers if your opponent doesn't have a removal spell for your [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly) immediately. Originally, I had four copies of this in the list, but I decided that I wanted to cut a copy and play a singleton [Blue Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Sun%27s+Zenith). The Zenith lets me get full value out of my Chalices, and it lets me find enough gas to close otherwise unwinnable games.

[Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) seems better than [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) in this deck. I want to make sure I can kill any [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)s that may render my [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s useless. I'll still have countermagic for things like [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), and I'll have some other cheap spot removal in my sideboard for the Vampire match-up.

![Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Doom+Blade)  
[Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) is the best counterspell in Standard. It's a common and shouldn't be difficult to acquire. I'm going to happily play four of this card.

I like playing singleton copies of [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). Sometimes there's something on the battlefield that just needs to go. Having a single copy of [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) in the deck makes you draw live in the most dire of board positions.

Once I stitch all the pieces together it looks something like this.

I want to play some extra cheap spot removal in my sideboard to help against decks like Red and [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel). [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) is my favorite of the bunch. We'll also want some [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)s for fighting against [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) decks. The rest of the sideboard will be made up of targeted discard spells. Here's the sideboard I've decided on:


> 
> 4 [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure)  
>  3 [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)  
>  4 [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)  
>  2 [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek)  
>  2 [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil)
> 
> 
> 

I decided to play a few games with the deck to see how it fared against what players at my local shop were playing.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab153_spellskite.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Jwar Isle Refuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Refuge), 2 [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird), [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet), and [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade). My opponent played a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and passed the turn. I drew [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly), played my [Jwar Isle Refuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Refuge) and passed the turn back. My opponent played an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and passed the turn. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played my [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), cast [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) and passed back. I drew a [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), cast [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for one, attacked with my [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird), tapped the Chalice for two mana thanks to the Bird's trigger, played my [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), and tapped it to cast [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet). My opponent cast a [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), cast a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), searched up some copies, played a fourth land, and passed the turn. I attempted to tap the [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) on my opponent's end step, but he paid 2 life to redirect it to [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). I drew another [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly), and passed the turn. My opponent played a fifth land and cast [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), activated Gideon's +2, and passed the turn back.

I made my 1/1s, drew another [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet), and attacked with [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird), which traded with a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). I then cast the second [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) and made his Gideon a 6/6, but I tapped it. He then cast another [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) and equipped [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine). I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly), and passed the turn. My opponent cast [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), gave him -1 to draw a card, cast [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) on my [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly), and attempted to enter combat after animating his Gideon. I tapped the Hawk and let myself eat 6 damage. I drew a [Jwar Isle Refuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Refuge), cast [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), and passed the turn. My opponent gave Gideon +2 and attempted to enter combat with the Hawk again. I tapped it. He cast another [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), cast another [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), equipped that [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), and passed the turn. I drew a [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift) and tried to think of a way to win the game. It seemed impossible even if I drew perfectly and my opponent drew nothing, so I conceded.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab153_gideon.jpg)I kept [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), 2 [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), and [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly). I played a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), cast [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), and caught my opponent with a hand of [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), and four lands, including a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade). I figured that I could resolve my [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) on turn two and take the Jace, so I decided to take the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) while I had the chance. My opponent played a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and passed the turn. I drew a [Jwar Isle Refuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Refuge), cast [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), and saw the same hand as before plus a [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine). I took the [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), played my [Jwar Isle Refuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Refuge), and passed the turn. My opponent drew and cast [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), which seemed pretty unlucky for me.

I drew a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), played my land, cast [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), and passed the turn. My opponent cast [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), gave him -1, and passed the turn. I drew a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and attacked Jace, but my opponent chump-blocked. I cast [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for two and passed the turn. My opponent gave Jace -1 again, played a fourth land, cast two [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s, and passed the turn. I cast [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly) and attacked Jace. My opponent chose not to block, so I took out Jace and then passed the turn. My opponent cast Diving Offering on the [Thopter Assembly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Assembly), cast another [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), attacked me down to 24, and passed the turn. I drew a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), played it, and passed the turn after attacking with [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk). My opponent equipped a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) with [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), and I responded by casting [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade). My opponent equipped it to the other [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) and attacked. I discarded, and he untapped all his lands, then cast [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) and gave him -2 to kill my [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk). I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and conceded to the interaction my opponent had on the table.

The Caw-Blade matchup is very bad for this deck. I thought the [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s would be good, but because of [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) they're actually just awkward.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab153_bloodghast.jpg)I won the roll, mulliganed, and kept [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), 2 [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird), [Liliana's Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter), and [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift). I played my [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Vampire Lacerator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator) and passed the turn back. I drew an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), cast [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird), and passed the turn. My opponent went to 19, attacked for 2, cast [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), and passed the turn. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played my [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), attacked for 1, and cast [Liliana's Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter), and my opponent discarded a [Pulse Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker). My opponent went to 17, and attacked for 4, but I traded my Specter for the Lacerator. My opponent cast a [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn), played a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and passed the turn. I drew a [Blue Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Sun%27s+Zenith), played my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), used both [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s to cast an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for one, and attacked with my [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird). My opponent decided to [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) the [Thrummingbird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrummingbird), so I cast [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), and passed the turn. My opponent cast another [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) and passed back. I cast [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift), attacked for 4 lifelinking damage, and passed the turn back to my opponent, whose creatures all suddenly had 0 power. My opponent thought for a bit and decided to scoop up his cards.

I drew another [Jwar Isle Refuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Refuge), played it, cast [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) on the [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn), and passed the turn.

I cast another [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), played my land, and passed the turn. My opponent drew and passed again. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift), and attacked for 8 lifelinking damage, putting me at 30 and putting my opponent on a one-turn clock.

The deck fared much better against a deck that really folds to the [Gravitational Shift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravitational+Shift). This deck doesn't feel great to me, but it utilizes an underplayed enchantment that a lot of readers have asked me to build around. This deck is very easy to put together, and it has what it takes to beat some of the mainstream strategies in Standard.

As always, be sure to hit the forums if you have any questions or comments.

Happy brewing!
