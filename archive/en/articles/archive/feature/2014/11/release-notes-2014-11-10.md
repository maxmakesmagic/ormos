The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. They're intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed. Notably, none of the cards that have been released in previous *Magic* products are listed.

GENERAL NOTES


**Release Information**


The *Magic: The Gathering—Commander* (2014 Edition) release consists of five different game packs. Each game pack contains a deck with 100 different cards plus an oversized premium foil commander card. The five decks are Forged in Stone, Peer Through Time, Sworn to Darkness, Built from Scratch, and Guided by Nature.

**New Cards and Format Legality**


There are 61 cards within the *Magic: The Gathering—Commander* (2014 Edition) decks that are completely new to the *Magic* game. These cards are legal for play in the Vintage and Legacy formats only. They aren't legal for play in the Standard or Modern formats.


The other cards in this release are legal for play in any format that already allows those cards. That is, appearing in this release doesn't change a card's legality in any format.


For more information about *Magic* formats, please visit [Wizards.com/Rules](http://magic.wizards.com/en/rules). For information about the format legality of a specific card, please visit [Gatherer.Wizards.com](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx), search for the card, and check the "Sets & Legality" tab.




---

**Overview**


Created and popularized by fans, the Commander variant is usually played in casual free-for-all multiplayer games, although two-player games are also popular. Each player starts at 40 life. Each player's deck is headed by a commander—traditionally a legendary creature, although this release introduces five planeswalkers that can also be a deck's commander. A player's choice of commander determines which other cards can be played in the deck.


A recommended banned list for the Commander format is maintained by the rules committee at [MTGCommander.net](http://www.mtgcommander.net/rules.php), not by Wizards of the Coast. On *Magic Online*, the Commander format follows that banned list.




---

**Commander Deck Construction**



* Commander decks are exactly 100 cards, including the deck's commander.
* The deck's commander must be a legendary creature or one of the five planeswalkers in this release.
* Commander is a "singleton" format. That is, other than basic lands, each card must have a different English name.
* Your commander's color identity determines the other cards that can be in your deck. A card's color identity includes its color, as defined by its mana cost or color indicator, and the colors of any colored mana symbols in the rules text.
* A card can't be included in your deck if its color identity includes a color not in your commander's color identity.
* Color identity is established before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander becomes a different color.
* The colors of colored mana symbols found only in reminder text aren't part of a card's color identity.
* A land card with one or more basic land types can't be included in your deck if it could produce mana of a color not in your commander's color identity.
* During the game, if mana that isn't a color in your commander's color identity would be added to your mana pool, that much colorless mana is added to your mana pool instead.



---

**Using Your Commander**


Commanders play a prominent role in games, often appearing on the battlefield multiple times.



* Your commander begins the game in the command zone, a game area created for the Commander format and now also used for nontraditional *Magic* cards (including plane, scheme, and conspiracy cards) and for emblems created by planeswalkers. The other 99 cards are shuffled and become your library.
* You may cast your commander from the command zone. Each time you do, it costs 2 more to cast for each time you previously cast it from the command zone that game.
* If your commander would be put into your graveyard from anywhere or be exiled from anywhere, you may choose to put it into the command zone instead.


In addition to the normal rules regarding winning and losing the game, the Commander format has one other rule: A player who has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. This is unlikely to happen if your commander is a planeswalker, although it still applies if that planeswalker becomes a creature and deals combat damage.




* Players should keep track of combat damage dealt to them by each commander over the course of the game.
* This rule includes a player's own commander, which can deal combat damage to its owner if the commander is controlled by another player or if combat damage gets redirected to that player.



---

**Alternative Mulligan Rule**


The Commander variant uses an alternative mulligan rule: Each time a player takes a mulligan, rather than shuffling his or her entire hand of cards into his or her library, that player exiles any number of cards from his or her hand. Then the player draws a number of cards equal to one less than the number of cards he or she exiled this way. Once a player keeps an opening hand, that player shuffles all cards he or she exiled this way into his or her library.




---

**Leaving the Game**


Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after a player loses and leaves the game.



* When a player leaves the game, all permanents, spells, and other cards owned by that player also leave the game.
* If that player controlled any abilities or copies of spells that were waiting to resolve, they cease to exist.
* If that player controlled any permanents owned by another player, the effects that gave control of them to the player who left end. If this doesn't give control of them to a different player (perhaps because they entered the battlefield under the control of the player who left), they're exiled.



---

**Oversized Commanders**


Each *Magic: The Gathering—Commander* (2014 Edition) deck comes with an oversized premium foil card that corresponds to the commander of that deck. This card is for fun only and isn't required for Commander gameplay.



* You must have the traditional *Magic* card version of your commander, even if you use the oversized card.
* As long as your commander is in a public zone, such as the command zone or the battlefield, you may substitute the oversized card for the traditional *Magic* card.
* If your commander is in a hidden zone, such as your library or your hand, use the traditional *Magic* card.



---

**New Ability Word: Lieutenant**


Lieutenant is an ability word that appears in italics on a cycle of creatures that become more powerful if you control your commander. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_4lq2bfxzcp.png)



Tyrant's Familiar  





* Lieutenant abilities apply only if your commander is on the battlefield and under your control.
* Lieutenant abilities refer only to whether you control your commander, not any other player's commander.
* If you gain control of a creature with a lieutenant ability owned by another player, that ability will check to see if you control your commander and will apply if you do. It won't check whether its owner controls his or her commander.
* If you lose control of your commander, lieutenant abilities of creatures you control will immediately stop applying. If this causes a creature's toughness to become less than or equal to the amount of damage marked on it, the creature will be destroyed.
* If a triggered ability granted by a lieutenant ability triggers, and in response to that trigger you lose control of your commander (causing the lieutenant to lose that ability), that triggered ability will still resolve.



---

**Cycle: Offerings**


The Offerings are a cycle of cards that have two beneficial effects. For each, you and an opponent of your choice are rewarded.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_p8imavql4m.png)



Intellectual Offering  

4U  

Instant  

Choose an opponent. You and that player each draw three cards.  

Choose an opponent. Untap all nonland permanents you control and all nonland permanents that player controls.




* You may choose the same opponent for each of the effects, or you may choose different opponents. None of the affected players are targets of the spell.
* For each of the Offerings except Volcanic Offering (see its entry in the Card-Specific Notes section), you choose the opponents for each effect as the spell resolves.

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_w027c2vwzo.png)



Æther Gale  

3UU  

Sorcery  

Return six target nonland permanents to their owners' hands.




* You must choose six different legal targets in order to cast Æther Gale. If some, but not all, of those targets become illegal before Æther Gale resolves, the remaining legal targets will be put into their owners' hands.






---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_xahemjbpzx.png)



Angel of the Dire Hour  

5WW  

Creature — Angel  

5/4  

Flash  

Flying  

When Angel of the Dire Hour enters the battlefield, if you cast it from your hand, exile all attacking creatures.




* Creatures that were declared as attackers or entered the battlefield attacking continue to be attacking creatures until the combat phase ends. It's possible to exile all attacking creatures after they've dealt combat damage if you cast Angel of the Dire Hour during the combat damage step or end of combat step.
* If you cast Angel of the Dire Hour outside of combat, its triggered ability will trigger but have no effect.
* If a spell or ability instructs you to put Angel of the Dire Hour onto the battlefield from your hand, that means you won't have cast it, so its triggered ability won't trigger.



---

Arcane Lighthouse  

Land  

t: Add 1 to your mana pool.  

1, t: Until end of turn, creatures your opponents control lose hexproof and shroud and can't have hexproof or shroud.




* The second ability applies only to creatures controlled by your opponents when it resolves. Creatures that enter the battlefield or come under an opponent's control later in the turn won't be affected.
* After the second ability resolves, continuous effects generated by the resolution of spells and abilities that would give hexproof or shroud to one of the affected creatures aren't created. For example, after the second ability resolves, a spell cast by an opponent that gives creatures he or she controls hexproof wouldn't cause the creatures to have hexproof. (If that spell has additional effects, such as raising the power of the creatures, those effects will apply as normal.)
* Continuous effects generated by static abilities (such as an Aura that grants hexproof to a creature) will not apply during the turn, but will resume applying once the turn ends.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_1t4rmoyodp.png)



Assault Suit  

4  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +2/+2, has haste, can't attack you or a planeswalker you control, and can't be sacrificed.  

At the beginning of each opponent's upkeep, you may have that player gain control of equipped creature until end of turn. If you do, untap it.  

Equip 3




* The equipped creature can't be sacrificed for any reason. If an effect instructs you to sacrifice it, you can't and it remains on the battlefield. You also can't sacrifice it to pay a cost that requires you to sacrifice a creature.
* If an effect instructs you to sacrifice a creature, and you control any creatures other than the creature equipped with Assault Suit, you must sacrifice one of them. You can't try to sacrifice the equipped creature, fail, and therefore ignore the effect.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_y7duh2lcr4.png)



Benevolent Offering  

3W  

Instant  

Choose an opponent. You and that player each put three 1/1 white Spirit creature tokens with flying onto the battlefield.  

Choose an opponent. You gain 2 life for each creature you control and that player gains 2 life for each creature he or she controls.




* In some unusual cases, the Spirit tokens will have a toughness of 0 or less as they enter the battlefield, perhaps because an opponent controls an enchantment that gives your creatures -1/-1. Because state-based actions aren't performed in the middle of a spell's resolution, you'll gain 2 life for each of those Spirit tokens. After Benevolent Offering has finished resolving, the Spirit tokens will die and subsequently cease to exist.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_1bax7qa9qh.png)



Bitter Feud  

4R  

Enchantment  

As Bitter Feud enters the battlefield, choose two players.  

If a source controlled by one of the chosen players would deal damage to the other chosen player or a permanent that player controls, that source deals double that damage to that player or permanent instead.




* Bitter Feud applies to damage dealt by any source controlled by one of the chosen players, not just combat damage.
* The source of the damage doesn't change. A spell that deals damage will specify the source of the damage. This is usually the spell itself. An ability that deals damage will specify the source of the damage, although it will never be the ability itself. Usually the source of the ability is also the source of the damage.
* If there are two Bitter Feuds on the battlefield, and the same two players were chosen for each, damage dealt will be doubled for each. So, two Bitter Feuds will end up multiplying the damage by four, three will multiply the damage by eight, and four by sixteen.
* If multiple effects modify how damage is dealt, the player being dealt damage, or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage, chooses the order in which to apply the effects. For example, the ability of [Decorated Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decorated+Griffin) says "1W: Prevent the next 1 combat damage that would be dealt to you this turn." Suppose you control a [Decorated Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decorated+Griffin), and you and an opponent are the chosen players for a Bitter Feud. If a creature that player controls would deal 3 combat damage to you, and [Decorated Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decorated+Griffin)'s ability has resolved once, you can choose to either (a) apply the effect from [Decorated Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decorated+Griffin) first and prevent 1 damage, and then let Bitter Feud's effect double the remaining 2 damage, for a result 4 damage being dealt to you, or (b) let Bitter Feud's effect apply first and double the damage to 6, and then apply the effect from [Decorated Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decorated+Griffin) to prevent 1 damage, for a result of 5 damage being dealt to you.

Breaching Leviathan  

7UU  

Creature — Leviathan  

9/9  

When Breaching Leviathan enters the battlefield, if you cast it from your hand, tap all nonblue creatures. Those creatures don't untap during their controllers' next untap steps.




* The triggered ability affects all nonblue creatures, including those you control.
* The triggered ability tracks the creatures, but not their controllers. If any of the creatures changes controllers before its original controller's next untap step has come around, that creature won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_9y357n20t1.png)



Comeuppance  

3W  

Instant  

Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you and planeswalkers you control this turn by sources you don't control. If damage from a creature source is prevented this way, Comeuppance deals that much damage to that creature. If damage from a noncreature source is prevented this way, Comeuppance deals that much damage to the source's controller.




* Comeuppance's effect is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, Comeuppance (not the original source) deals damage to the creature or player as part of that prevention effect. Comeuppance is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect the new damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
* If Comeuppance would deal damage to an opponent, you may redirect that damage to a planeswalker that player controls.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_2892v0xxnm.png)



Commander's Sphere  

3  

Artifact  

t: Add to your mana pool one mana of any color in your commander's color identity.  

Sacrifice Commander's Sphere: Draw a card.




* The color identity of your commander is set before the game begins and doesn't change during the game, even if your commander is in a hidden zone (such as your hand or your library) or if an effect changes your commander's color.
* If your commander is colorless, it has no colors in its color identity, so Commander's Sphere produces no mana.
* In formats other than Commander, Commander's Sphere produces no mana.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_j7p2zy504e.png)



Containment Priest  

1W  

Creature — Human Cleric  

2/2  

Flash  

If a nontoken creature would enter the battlefield and it wasn't cast, exile it instead.




* Containment Priest's last ability won't affect any nontoken creatures that were cast, including ones cast from unusual zones such as your graveyard.
* Containment Priest's last ability doesn't stop creature tokens from entering the battlefield. It also doesn't affect creatures that were already on the battlefield.
* If Containment Priest enters the battlefield without being cast, it won't exile itself.
* If Containment Priest enters the battlefield at the same time as other creatures, its ability won't affect those creatures.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_ym5dl2xst5.png)



Creeperhulk  

3GG  

Creature — Plant Elemental  

5/5  

Trample  

1G: Until end of turn, target creature you control has base power and toughness 5/5 and gains trample.




* The activated ability overwrites all previous effects that set the target creature's base power and/or toughness to specific values. Other effects that set its base power and/or toughness that start to apply after Creeperhulk's ability resolves will overwrite Creeperhulk's effect.
* Effects that modify the target creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) or [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem), will apply to the creature no matter when they started applying. The same is true for counters that affect the target creature's power and toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_moigyggsml.png)



Crown of Doom  

3  

Artifact  

Whenever a creature attacks you or a planeswalker you control, it gets +2/+0 until end of turn.  

2: Target player other than Crown of Doom's owner gains control of it. Activate this ability only during your turn.




* You are Crown of Doom's owner if it started the game in your deck. Therefore, once you hand off the Crown, your opponents cannot give it back to you by activating its ability (although other effects, such as the one [Zedruu the Greathearted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zedruu+the+Greathearted)'s ability creates, may do this).






---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_xsgmydkbp1.png)



Daretti, Scrap Savant  

3R  

Planeswalker — Daretti  

3  

+2: Discard up to two cards, then draw that many cards.  

−2: Sacrifice an artifact. If you do, return target artifact card from your graveyard to the battlefield.  

−10: You get an emblem with "Whenever an artifact is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, return that card to the battlefield at the beginning of the next end step."  

Daretti, Scrap Savant can be your commander.




* You may choose to discard zero cards as the first ability resolves. In that case, you won't draw any cards.
* You choose which artifact to sacrifice as the second ability resolves. You must sacrifice an artifact if you control at least one at that time. For example, if you control two artifacts when you activate the second ability, but the artifact you intended to sacrifice is destroyed in response, you must sacrifice the other artifact as the ability resolves.
* The ability of Daretti's emblem will return the artifact card only if it's still in your graveyard when the delayed triggered ability resolves at the beginning of the next end step. If the artifact card left your graveyard before that point (even if it was put back into your graveyard), the ability won't return it to the battlefield.

Demon of Wailing Agonies  

3BB  

Creature — Demon  

4/4  

Flying  
*Lieutenant* — As long as you control your commander, Demon of Wailing Agonies gets +2/+2 and has "Whenever Demon of Wailing Agonies deals combat damage to a player, that player sacrifices a creature."




* If Demon of Wailing Agonies deals combat damage to a player at the same time your commander is dealt lethal damage, the triggered ability will trigger and the player will sacrifice a creature.






---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_tzxaxbkbug.png)



Domineering Will  

3U  

Instant  

Target player gains control of up to three target nonattacking creatures until end of turn. Untap those creatures. They block this turn if able.




* The controller of the creatures still chooses which attacking creature each of the three target creatures blocks.
* Each of those creatures blocks only if it's able to do so as the declare blockers step begins. If, at that time, one of the creatures is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, or no creatures are attacking that creature's controller or a planeswalker controlled by that player, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't block in that case either.
* Notably, Domineering Will doesn't give any of the target creatures haste. Unless they have haste due to some other means, they won't be able to attack that turn.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_qp7l9q83ir.png)



Dualcaster Mage  

1RR  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

Flash  

When Dualcaster Mage enters the battlefield, copy target instant or sorcery spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.




* You may change any number of the targets for the copy, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the targeted spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or similar), you can't choose a different mode.
* If the copied spell targets a spell on the stack (like [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) does, for example), you can't change that spell's target to itself.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/c14/aakdfnppleih2/en_mtweokdeg9.png)



Dulcet Sirens  

2U  

Creature — Siren  

1/3  

U, t: Target creature attacks target opponent this turn if able.  

Morph U ( *You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.* )




* "Target opponent" means one of your opponents. In other words, Dulcet Sirens's ability can't make a creature attack you.
* The target creature must attack the target opponent if able, not a planeswalker controlled by that player.
* If, as attackers are declared, the target creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under its controller's control continuously since his or her last turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having the creature attack the opponent, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack that player in that case either.
* If the creature can't attack the player for one of the above reasons but it can still attack elsewhere, its controller may choose to have it attack another player, attack a planeswalker, or not attack at all.
* If either the target creature or the target player is an illegal target when the activated ability tries to resolve, the ability will have no effect. The creature won't be forced to attack that opponent, but it still can if able.

Feldon of the Third Path  

1RR  

Legendary Creature — Human Artificer  

2/3  

2R, t: Put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of target creature card in your graveyard, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types. It gains haste. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.




* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature card (except that the copy is also an artifact) and nothing else.
* If the copied creature card has x in its mana cost, X is 0.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature card will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature card will also work.
* If another creature becomes a copy of, or enters the battlefield as a copy of, the token, that creature will copy the creature card the token is copying, except it will also be an artifact. This is true even if the creature card that was copied by Feldon of the Third Path is no longer in the graveyard at that time. However, the new copy won't gain haste and you won't sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.
* If Feldon's ability creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (such as the one [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) creates), each of those tokens will gain haste and you'll sacrifice each of them.

Fell the Mighty  

4W  

Sorcery  

Destroy all creatures with power greater than target creature's power.




* Use the power of the target creature as Fell the Mighty resolves to determine which creatures are destroyed. Fell the Mighty doesn't target any of those creatures, so a creature with hexproof or protection from white will be destroyed if its power is high enough.
* Fell the Mighty won't destroy the target creature.
* If the target creature is an illegal target when Fell the Mighty tries to resolve, Fell the Mighty will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No creatures will be destroyed.

Flesh Carver  

2B  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

Intimidate  

1B, Sacrifice another creature: Put two +1/+1 counters on Flesh Carver.  

When Flesh Carver dies, put an X/X black Horror creature token onto the battlefield, where X is Flesh Carver's power.




* Use Flesh Carver's power when it died (including any +1/+1 counters it had) to determine X.

Grave Sifter  

5G  

Creature — Elemental Beast  

5/7  

When Grave Sifter enters the battlefield, each player chooses a creature type and returns any number of cards of that type from his or her graveyard to his or her hand.




* The creature type each player chooses applies only to that player. For example, if another player chose Elf, you wouldn't return Elf cards to your hand unless you also chose Elf (or if an Elf card in your graveyard also had the creature type you chose).

1WW  

Creature — Avatar  

3/2  

Vigilance  

When Hallowed Spiritkeeper dies, put X 1/1 white Spirit creature tokens with flying onto the battlefield, where X is the number of creature cards in your graveyard.




* Count the number of creature cards in your graveyard as the triggered ability resolves, including Hallowed Spiritkeeper itself if it's still there, to determine how many Spirits are created.

Impact Resonance  

1R  

Instant  

Impact Resonance deals X damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures, where X is the greatest amount of damage dealt by a source to a permanent or player this turn.




* You determine the value for X and announce how damage will be divided as you cast Impact Resonance. Each chosen target must receive at least 1 damage. Once the value of X is determined, it won't change, even if a source deals a greater amount of damage before Impact Resonance resolves. (Most of the time, the value of X in an effect would be determined only as the spell resolves. However, the rules state that if damage needs to be "divided," that information is checked as the spell is put on the stack.)
* Impact Resonance looks at the entire turn to see the greatest amount of damage dealt from a single source to a single permanent or player. For example, if the only damage dealt during the turn was [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake), which dealt 5 damage to each of four creatures and two players, then X is 5.
* If Impact Resonance has multiple targets, and some, but not all, of them become illegal before Impact Resonance resolves, Impact Resonance will still deal damage to the remaining legal targets according to the original damage division.

Incite Rebellion  

4RR  

Sorcery  

For each player, Incite Rebellion deals damage to that player and each creature that player controls equal to the number of creatures he or she controls.

Infernal Offering  

4B  

Sorcery  

Choose an opponent. You and that player each sacrifice a creature. Each player who sacrificed a creature this way draws two cards.  

Choose an opponent. Return a creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield, then that player returns a creature card from his or her graveyard to the battlefield.




* The sacrifice isn't optional. If you control at least one creature, you must sacrifice one. If you control no creatures, you won't sacrifice one and you won't draw two cards. The same is true for the chosen opponent.
* You choose which creature card you're returning to the battlefield, then the chosen opponent chooses which creature card he or she is returning. These choices aren't made until Infernal Offering resolves. Neither card is a target of Infernal Offering.

Malicious Affliction  

BB  

Instant  
*Morbid* — When you cast Malicious Affliction, if a creature died this turn, you may copy Malicious Affliction and may choose a new target for the copy.  

Destroy target nonblack creature.




* The copy of Malicious Affliction is created on the stack. It's not cast, so the copy won't cause the morbid ability to trigger again.
* By default, the copy has the same target as the original spell. You don't have to change this target if you don't want to or can't (perhaps if there are no other nonblack creatures on the battlefield). If you do change the target, the new target must be a legal target for Malicious Affliction.

Destroy all creatures, then return a creature card put into a graveyard this way to the battlefield under your control. It's a black Zombie in addition to its other colors and types. Exile Necromantic Selection.

Raving Dead  

4B  

Creature — Zombie  

2/6  

Deathtouch  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, choose an opponent at random. Raving Dead attacks that player this combat if able.  

Whenever Raving Dead deals combat damage to a player, that player loses half his or her life, rounded down.




* Raving Dead must attack the chosen player if able, not a planeswalker controlled by that player.
* If, as attackers are declared, Raving Dead is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under your control continuously since your turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having Raving Dead attack the chosen player, you aren't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack that player in that case either.
* If Raving Dead can't attack the chosen player for one of the above reasons but it can still attack elsewhere, you may choose to have it attack another player, attack a planeswalker, or not attack at all.
* If your turn has multiple combat phases, Raving Dead's ability triggers at the beginning of each of them. Ignore any choices made during previous combat phases that turn.
* The last ability triggers and resolves after combat damage has been dealt. For example, if an opponent has 17 life and Raving Dead deals 2 combat damage to him or her, he or she will end up at 8 life.

Scrap Mastery  

3RR  

Sorcery  

Each player exiles all artifact cards from his or her graveyard, then sacrifices all artifacts he or she controls, then puts all cards he or she exiled this way onto the battlefield.




* "Exiled this way" refers to the exile instruction that's part of Scrap Mastery's effect. If the sacrificed artifacts are instead exiled because of a replacement effect, those cards won't be put onto the battlefield.

Siege Behemoth  

5GG  

Creature — Beast  

7/4  

Hexproof  

As long as Siege Behemoth is attacking, for each creature you control, you may have that creature assign its combat damage as though it weren't blocked.




* You decide whether to assign a creature's combat damage as though it weren't blocked just before it assigns that damage. You may make a different choice for each creature you control—that is, you may have none, some, or all of those creatures assign combat damage as though they weren't blocked.

Song of the Dryads  

2G  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant permanent  

Enchanted permanent is a colorless Forest land.




* The enchanted permanent loses any card types, subtypes, and colors it previously had. It keeps any supertypes it had and its name remains unchanged. It gains "t: Add G to your mana pool" and loses all other abilities from its rules text. It will still have any abilities it gained from other effects.
* If the permanent was an Aura or an Equipment, it becomes unattached from whatever it was attached to.

B  

Instant  

Put an X/X black Horror creature token onto the battlefield, where X is the number of creatures that died this turn.

Stitcher Geralf  

3UU  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

3/4  

2U, t: Each player puts the top three cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard. Exile up to two creature cards put into graveyards this way. Put an X/X blue Zombie creature token onto the battlefield, where X is the total power of the cards exiled this way.




* "Exiled this way" refers to the exile instruction that's part of the ability's effect. If the cards each player would put into his or her graveyard are exiled because of a replacement effect, those cards won't be in the graveyards to be exiled by the next part of the ability. In this case, the value of X will be 0. You'll put a 0/0 token onto the battlefield, then that token will die and subsequently cease to exist (unless something else raises its toughness above 0).

Teferi, Temporal Archmage  

4UU  

Planeswalker — Teferi  

5  

+1: Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one of them into your hand and the other on the bottom of your library.  

−1: Untap up to four target permanents.  

−10: You get an emblem with "You may activate loyalty abilities of planeswalkers you control on any player's turn any time you could cast an instant."  

Teferi, Temporal Archmage can be your commander.




* If you control Teferi's emblem, the rule that says you can activate a loyalty ability only if none of that permanent's loyalty abilities have been activated that turn still applies. In other words, you could activate a planeswalker's loyalty ability once on your turn and once on each of your opponents' turns.
* If you control [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) (from the *Magic 2015* core set) and its activated ability has resolved, and you also control Teferi's emblem, for each planeswalker you control, you can activate one of its loyalty abilities during that turn any time you could cast an instant, and then you may activate a loyalty ability again that turn (choosing the same loyalty ability or a different one) any time you could cast an instant.

Volcanic Offering deals 7 damage to target creature you don't control and 7 damage to target creature of an opponent's choice you don't control.




* Unlike the other Offerings, you choose the opponents for Volcanic Offering as you cast the spell because those players are involved in choosing the spell's targets.
* The chosen opponent for each effect may choose the same target nonbasic land or creature you don't control that you did.

Wake the Dead  

XBB  

Instant  

Cast Wake the Dead only during combat on an opponent's turn.  

Return X target creature cards from your graveyard to the battlefield. Sacrifice those creatures at the beginning of the next end step.




* The delayed triggered ability that makes you sacrifice the creatures will trigger only once. If you don't sacrifice one or more of those creatures at that time (perhaps because another player gained control of them), the ability won't try to make you sacrifice them on future turns.

Warmonger Hellkite  

4RR  

Creature — Dragon  

5/5  

Flying  

All creatures attack each combat if able.  

1R: Attacking creatures get +1/+0 until end of turn.




* Each creature's controller still chooses which player or planeswalker the creature attacks.
* If, during a player's declare attackers step, a creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
* Only creatures that are attacking when the last ability resolves will get +1/+0. That is, activating that ability before attackers have been declared won't give the bonus to any creatures, including ones that attack later in the turn.
* If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, creatures must attack during each combat phase in which they're able to.
