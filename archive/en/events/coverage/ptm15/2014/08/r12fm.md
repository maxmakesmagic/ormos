### PRO TOUR MAGIC 2015


ROUND 12: RAPHAEL LEVY VS. PATRICK DICKMANN
===========================================

Jacob Van Lunen

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published


August 2, 2014
 











 Hall of Famer Raphael Levy is no stranger to playing *Magic* at the very highest levels of competition. Levy has three Pro Tour Top 8s and an impressive nineteen Grand Prix Top 8s over the course of his career. Recently Levy's name has become synonymous with Team Revolution, a group of European *Magic* Pros that have been crushing professional level events since Pro Tour *Theros*. Levy is currently on a long *Magic* trip, but he'll be headed to South Africa after this tournament to get married on August 31. Levy is armed with Team Revolution's Rabblemaster Red deck, a powerful new aggressive strategy that has been performing very well over the course of the weekend.




 His opponent, Patrick Dickmann, is a relative newcomer to the professional *Magic* scene. In his short career, has proven himself to be a real contender though. Dickman has accrued 40 Pro Points thus far this season with the help of a Pro Tour and Grand Prix Top 8 along the way. Dickmann is playing Blue Devotion, a deck he knows very well and is confident in his ability to pilot optimally.



Both players enter this round at 9 â€“ 3. A win ensures their chances at Top 8 remain alive. Anything less, and the hope of playing on Sunday dims a lot. 





*Both Patrick Dickmann and Raphael Levy are playing for Platinum status, or if they can win out, maybe even a Top 8.*
