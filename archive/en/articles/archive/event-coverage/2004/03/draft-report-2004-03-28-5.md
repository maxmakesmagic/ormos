Drafting With Bob Maher
-----------------------


Bob Maher, "The Great One," has a multitude of high tournament finishes - he won Pro Tour Chicago 1999, among other impressive finishes, and can often be found near the top of the standings. He is 9-2-1 going into this draft, and needs to win out to have a chance at top 8.


His first pack offered him the choice between [Soul Nova](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Nova), [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) and [Fangren Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter). Bob took the full time available to make his decision, finally abandoning the green card in favor of the [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb). His next pack offered no good red cards, but had [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol), [Raise the Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm), [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter), [Predator's Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike), and [One Dozen Eyes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+Dozen+Eyes), and Bob took the equipment.


He next had the options of [Mirror Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem), [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb), [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem), [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) and [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem), and he decided to go into white with the [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) to go with his [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). He snapped up an [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) from the next pack, as the only other options were [Raise the Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and a couple mana Myr. His next pack offered Nim Shreiker, [Fireshrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireshrieker) and a Talisman, and Bob took the [Fireshrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireshrieker).


The quality of the packs dropped sharply here, though, as Bob only managed a [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace) (over Dragon's Blood) and a [Leonin Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder) from the next couple packs. His eighth pick found a [Loxodon Punisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Punisher) still in the pack, though, and he took the equipment-hungry elephant. He got the [Grid Monitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grid+Monitor) back from the pack that he opened and then a [Tower of Eons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+of+Eons) from the next pack, but nothing else of note except a [Slagwurm Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagwurm+Armor).



![Thought Dissector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thought+Dissector)

The second pack Bob opened had very spicy red, with [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin), [Detonate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate) and [Slith Firewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Firewalker) along with some playable black and green cards. Bob took the Spikeshot. His next pack was also very deep, with [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic), [Roar of the Kha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Kha), [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam), [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem), [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub), and [Nim Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shambler) all jostling for attention. Bob debated for a while, but finally took his second Cub.


The third pack Bob looked at had [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) in his colors, but Bob bypassed it, deciding instead to shift into blue with a [Somber Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard). His next two picks were twin [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr)s, neither over anything good, and the sixth pack still had a [Domineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domineer) in it, which Bob snapped up quickly. The next pack had an equally obvious [Goblin Dirigible](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dirigible).


The next pack passed to him had [Krark-Clan Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Shaman), [Omega Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omega+Myr), [Trolls of Tel-Jilad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trolls+of+Tel-Jilad), and [Wurmskin Forger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger). Bob decided to counter-draft the [Wurmskin Forger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger), passing the Trolls on. He also got a late-pick [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod) and an even later [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate) to round the pack out. Heading into Darksteel, Bob didn't seem too pleased with his deck.


His first Darksteel pack had [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem), [Loxodon Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic), [Darksteel Brute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Brute) and [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer), and Bob took the 2/4 flier. His second pack was disappointing, though, with [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) and [Arcbound Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser) being the only respectable cards, and Bob took the Truth.


The third pack saw Bob take an [Arcbound Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher) over a couple lesser Arcbound creatures (Hybrid and Stinger), but his fourth pick gave him pause. After stopping to read the [Thought Dissector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Dissector), Bob took a [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) over [Arcbound Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Hybrid+) or [Loxodon Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic).


Bob selected a [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer) over [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger) for his fifth pick, then a second [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) over Arcbound Hybrid, [Quicksilver Behemoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Behemoth) or a second Engineer or Ingot. His next pack had a [Soulscour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulscour) in it, but he grabbed the [Auriok Siege Sled](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Siege+Sled) instead. [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger), [Arcane Spyglass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Spyglass), and [Vex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vex) rounded out the pack.


Bob was unhappy with the end result. He explained that he was planning on forcing black/red when he sat down, but that he never saw the cards that would let him do that - in fact, due to the lack of those colors that he saw, he was guessing that the person on his right was black/red. His drafting was also affected by the knowledge that he needed to win all his matches to have a chance at top 8. "3-0 or bust, and I certainly busted." He's now hoping that he can go 2-1, but guessing more likely 1-2.
