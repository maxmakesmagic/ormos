Updated Alternative Play Schedule
---------------------------------


The alternative play schedule that was announced in the *Zendikar Rising* set article has changed! Check out the latest schedule below.

* December 16–23: **Supreme Draft: *Vintage Cube***. What happens when you combine one of the most powerful formats ever with the most powerful Draft style? Yep. A week of that.
* December 23–January 13: ***Vintage Cube***. Another update in, this time with *Commander Legends* cards in the mix. This is easily the most common request we get, so . . . we hear you. More *Vintage Cube*. This will last for a few weeks, until . . .
* January 13–20: **A brand-new addition to the Spotlight Cube Series**. As usual, more details will come later, but this one promises to be a wheel of a good time.
* January 20–28: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.
