**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**



2 GP Top 32s


2 GP Top 16s

**What deck did you play and why?**



Tron.  I disliked everything I tested, so I audibled to Tron because it’s the deck I’m the most familiar with.





**Would you have made any changes to your deck and why?**



Yes.  I am only playing the fourth [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus) over the fourth [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) because of a deck registration error.  Also, there should be a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) in the board for [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift).  I’d cut a [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) for it.





**Which card was your maindeck MVP so far this weekend?  What about your sideboard?**



Maindeck: [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine).  The entire plan versus Delver is this card and it worked repeatedly.


Sideboard:  [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) for versatility; [Slaughter Games](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Games) for power.





**What are you most excited about for *Fate Reforged*?**



Ugin, the Spirit Dragon.  He is going in this deck as a two-of!!

**Would you have made any changes to your deck and why?**



-1 [Sigarda, Host of Herons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigarda%2C+Host+of+Herons).  Didn’t do anything all weekend.








**Which card was your maindeck MVP so far this weekend?  What about your sideboard?**



[Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind) in the maindeck; [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) in the sideboard.





**What are you most excited about for *Fate Reforged*?**



The limited format looks intense. A lot of different angles.

**What deck did you play and why?**



Zoo, splashing Anafenza and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s.  I felt it would be great against a field of Delver. and Anafenza shores up the [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) matchup to at least 50/50.





**Would you have made any changes to your deck and why?**



Slaughter Games .  . .not even sure about it.







**Which card was your maindeck MVP so far this weekend?  What about your sideboard?**




[Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout) in the board gave me a 7-for-1 against Delver . . . so, that!



Anafenza should be my Prom date.





**What are you most excited about for *Fate Reforged*?**



New [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny)!! @Kithkinz on Twitter, y’all!
