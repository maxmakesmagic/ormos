 Olivier"Thats what I do every round and still get mana flooded"


It seems Olivier just boarded out [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) earlier in the tourney versus a goblin deck. Olivier is piloting a green-black deck while Kai is with Affinity and both player have to win out to top 8.


Kai: "Wanna split."  
 Olivier: "Its not like its a PT."  
 Kai: "If I top 8, I win the GP, remember."  
 Olivier: "Ok, split, the winner buys a drink to the loser."


They both keep their hand and Olivier has second turn Vine Treillis while Kai has a [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), a Ravager, a Skullcamp and a [Welding Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar) in play by turn two. Olvier taps four mana on his next turn then pauses.


Kai: "Want me to pick one at random?"


Olivier finallychoses to play a second wall and an [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery).  
 Kai equips his [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), sacs it to the Ravager, and plays an Enforcer as well as a [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). Olivier has the mana to cast a Baloth and equip it with his own freshly cast Skullclamp. Kai plays a [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault), another [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and a [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) on his next turn and trades his Enforcer with Olivier's Baloth.


Olivier plays a morph which gets a smile from Kai then starts thinking again...


Kai:"Soooooooooooo??"  
 Olivier:"Lucky, so lucky."  
 Kai: "Of course I'm lucky."


Olivier just equips his morph and says go.   
 Kai adds a second disciple, and has double [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) for the kill, sacrificing all his other artifacts to his Ravager. It turns out Olivier's morph was a [Bane of the Living](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living) and he could have unmorphed in response to the second Disciple but then, Kai needed to have both Blast to kill Olivier who was on 22 lives before that.


Kai 1-0 Olivier


Olivier: " I always beat Kai, but usually, its cause I have bad matchups."


Olivier keeps his hand while Kai has to paris his no lander.


Olivier: "You have to believe in your deck, dont look at your hand and just say I keep."


Kai: "Ok, I keep."


It turns out Kai's hand is actually decent.


Kai: "Of course it's good, Olivier is a master."


Olivier has a turn three [Wood Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wood+Elves) followed by a Solemn while Kai has turn one Worker, turn two Sphere and turn three [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). Kai then gets out a Worker, a Disciple and an Hoverguard on his following turn while Olivier plays a second Solemn and a Bird.


Kai: "One Clamp."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbru04/fm15_2.jpg)Olivier agrees but their respective deck fail to deliver and Olivier gets a Symbiote to get even more lands. He then adds a third Solemn while Kai topdecks a Ravager that seems pretty good with this Disciple out with nine artifacts out, Olivier being at eleven lives. But Olivier has his own topdeck... a Skullclamp! He sacs his Bird and his Wood Elf only to play another Bird and sac it as well then plays a Baloth, a Bird and a Treillis.  
 Kai: "Comooooooooooooooooon Disciple."  
 Olivier: " That would be a good choice."


Kai has a Thirst, and doesnt draw a Disciple but a [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) which is enough to kill the Frenchman.


Kai 2-0 Olivier


I asked Olivier if the matchup is usually good and it seemed it should be ok but Kai's [Somber Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard) and [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) seemed to be too much for him to handle.
