Fifteen year-old Charlie Rinehart breezed his way through the competition on day one with a perfect 9-0 record. The youngster is an up-and-comer here on the east coast--having success in the StarCityGames tournament circuit. Nathan Holiday, on the other hand, has been undefeated going into day two many times before, recently having a perfect day one record at both Grand Prix Phoenix and Grand Prix Atlanta.



**The Decks:**




 Rinehart is playing Soul Sisters--a white aggro deck that leans on creatures like [Soul Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden) and Soul's Attendant to gain life and power up his [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate) and [Serra Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Ascendant)s. Rinehart mentioned that he had been playing this deck for three years and played a Daily Event on *Magic Online* every day in preparation for this event. Holiday brought Melira Pod to the table here in Worcester. The aggressive combo deck is capable of gaining infinite life or dealing infinite damage thanks to the interaction between [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast), [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), and either [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) or [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap).




**The Games:**




 Rinehart got an aggressive start in game one with a turn one [Soul Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden), a turn two [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate), and a turn three [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). His army started bashing in and quickly dropped Holiday down to nine life.




 Holiday responded with [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage) and [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), changed his Pridemage into an [Orzhov Pontiff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Pontiff) and used an [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) to clear Rinehart's board. Rinehart rebuilt with a [Soul Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden), [Serra Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Ascendant) and an [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure).




 Holiday stabilized by getting a Kitchen Finks, a [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap), and a [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast). When he drew [Ranger of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos) and cast it Rinehart paused and said, "I might have a response."




 Rinehart was bluffing and Ranger found a [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), which, when paired with [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) and [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast), ended the game for Holiday.
