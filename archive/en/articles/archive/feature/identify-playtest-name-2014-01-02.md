The journey for a card from concept to final card is fraught with peril. Many cards never make it out of design, and those that do make it undergo intense trial and experimentation during the development of the set. And then, even as they are being tweaked by the numbers, they gain ongoing creative tweaks as the name is finalized and the art is commissioned.


In today's Arcana I'm going to give you a playtest name of a current *Theros* card and you guess what card we're talking about.


**1.** This card was shaped by the playtest name "Passing Sneakiness." [What was it?](#)

**2.** This combat trick was at one time "Phalanx Formation." [What was it?](#)

**3.** This black creature was called the "Carnivorous Horse." [What was it?](#)
