The March 15, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 15, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Oliver Tiu's rise up the rankings](#7).


Today's Must
============


1. [How Mardu Vehicles Stays on Top](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/terry-soh/how-mardu-vehicles-stays-on-top) | MTG Mint Card | Terry Soh

This is an enlightening read for anyone looking at the state of Standard right now. Mardu Vehicles is generally considered the best deck in the format, but decklists today look much different from lists at [Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer). Soh looks at how the deck has evolved, what it means for the big two matchups, and what it means for Standard as a whole.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Standard Temur Tower Deck Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dTFKKBnkKQ) | TCGPlayer | Seth Manfield

No bannings means it's time to get to work cracking through an established Standard metagame. Seth Manfield thinks Temur Tower has strong matchups against the big two, and walks you through what makes the deck tick in this deck tech.

1. [Saheeli Sisters in Modern](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/96) | Hareruya English | Pierre Dagen

Combos on combos on combos on combos on life gain is a pretty apt description of this new Modern deck Dagen is touting today. He's somehow matched a Soul Sisters (super-duper life gain) deck with the Copy Cat combo, plus about three other combos, to form the basis for a new Modern deck—one with a strong [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) matchup.


1. [Vorthos Art History: Touches of Egyptian Art](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikelinnemann-03152017-vorthos-art-history-touches-of-egyptian-art/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann

With *Amonkhet* just around the corner, Linnemann visits with an actual Egyptologist to talk Egyptian style, culture, and, of course, art.


1. [Return to Dominaria?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k64XRzOJnA) | Aether Hub | Seiben

Seiben looks deep into the *Magic* Story to dig up evidence that we'll be returning to Dominaria sometime soon. And, no, I will neither confirm nor deny any such speculation. But, hey, story speculation is fun.

1. [Tasigur, the Golden Fang with Jeremy Noell](https://collected.company/2017/03/14/tasigur-golden-fang-jeremy-noell-150/) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Worlds collide as StarCityGames.com Commander aficionado Jeremy Noell lands on the 150th episode of the Command Zone. Because every 150th episode has to have a special guest star.


Top 25
======


1. Tiu keeps growing up

Oliver Tiu, the not-a-rookie-anymore who has steadily made his way onto the list of best players in the world, continues to rise up the rankings. Tiu finished 22nd at [Grand Prix New Jersey](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj17), one match behind players in the Top 8, giving him a few extra Pro Points and pushing him up a whopping six slots, all the way to No. 12 in the world. And he wasn't even the week's biggest gainer.


That honor goes to Petr Sochůrek, who, in winning [Grand Prix Barcelona](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbar17), rocketed up the rankings from not ranked at all to No. 16. His ascension comes at the cost of Samuel Black, who fell off the Top 25.


In other shifts, former No. 1 Owen Turtenwald rose one place, just above former No. 1 Seth Manfield and just behind former No. 1 Shota Yasooka. All three of them, however, currently trail *current* No. 1 Márcio Carvalho—who added another Grand Prix Top 8 to his list—by quite a margin.

What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Magic Mics | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT | Evan Erwin, Erin Campbell, and Reuben Bresler

It's Wednesday, which means it's time for Magic Mics. I'm sure they have [nothing much to talk about](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/march-13-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-03-13) this week.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Mark Rosewater: "We recognize the pendulum swung too far away from answers and we're swinging it back."](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/158404422863/i-get-that-theres-a-method-to-what-youre-doing)

Oh, boy. There was this whole thing yesterday where Mark Rosewater, on his blog [Blogatog](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), answered a not-coy question in a coy way due to a misunderstanding about what was being asked, and it turned into this whole thing that culminated in this post—that threats have outpaced answers and the pendulum will be swinging back. [Sam Stoddard has said as much](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/standard-2017-01-13).


It's worth noting that much of the confusion yesterday stems from this view of Rosewater as a spokesman for every aspect of R&D, while his primary focus is design. So when a question about gameplay balance comes in, which is more of a development question, it can apparently throw the internet into a tailspin.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Bocho's Black-Red Eldrazi](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-03-14)

Why play lame white in your black-red deck when you can play awesome Eldrazi?


That's the question I imagine *Magic Online* user Bocho had when he created this different take on an aggressive [Unlicensed Disintegration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration)/[Heart of Kiran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) deck. It has some of the hallmarks of Mardu Vehicles—the two aforementioned cards plus [Scrapheap Scrounger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger) and [Fatal Push](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push)—but subs in [Matter Reshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matter+Reshaper), [Thought-Knot Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer), and [Reality Smasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher). It was super effective, as Bocho went 5-0 in a competitive Standard League. People seem to have forgotten how powerful the Eldrazi can be. But not Bocho.
