When **Magic Online** comes back up from its downtime today players will be able to join Cube queues with prizes for the original *Ravnica* block! Cube will run until the *Theros* Prerelease begins on **Magic Online** which is 10 A.M. Pacific, Friday, October 4, 2013.

You might recall we ran a vote a few weeks ago asking what format you want paired with this Cube and 31.2% of the voters demanded the original *Ravnica* block! Second, with 26.9% of the vote, was triple *Innistrad*.

So what's changed in the cube since the last time you played it on **Magic Online**? Here's the breakdown:

* [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) replaces [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn)
* [Celestial Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Flare) replaces [Cataclysm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cataclysm)

* [Archangel of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune) replaces [Tithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tithe)
* [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) replaces [Banefire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire)
