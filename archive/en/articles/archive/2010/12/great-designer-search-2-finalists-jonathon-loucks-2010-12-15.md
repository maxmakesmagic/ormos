### Commentary:


Dinosaurs! Mechanically these beasts not only power up Evolve (whenever a creature with a larger power enters the battlefield, get a +1/+1 counter) but preeminence as well. While each color doesn't normally get a common this large, each color needs tools to interact with one of this set's main themes. In the primitive world, size matters. In set two and three, we'll see Epolith developing more sophisticated weapons.


The uncommon cycle hints to the overarching theme in the Epolith block. In set 1 players are rewarded for controlling at least two colors of permanents – a primitive form of innovation. Since the goal is somewhat easy, the reward is somewhat primitive as well – drawing a card, or maybe a +1/+1 counter. In set 2, players are rewarded for controlling at least three colors of permanents – a more advanced goal. The tools have advanced (gold cards) as have the rewards, such as increasing the effect of a spell (like a Galvanic Blast). In set 3, the goal of four or more colors comes with an even better tool – hybrid. The rewards are even still greater – like a Giant Growth that's conditionally an Overrun.


With the Preeminence cycle I wanted to create cards that let players do something that felt broken. Something that they are normally not allowed to do – like one-sided mass reanimation, or the Urza's block 'free' mechanic. The goal is that these cards look powerful yet are balanced by the hefty additional cost of needing a high-powered creature.
