After a triple Grand Prix weekend that saw most of our Top 25 competing in Sydney, there was surprisingly little movement among the game's best. Joel Larsson was the "big" winner of the week, jumping up two whole spots. Those two spots do, however, put him in the Top 10 as we head down the season's final stretch. That's not a bad spot to be in with invites to the World Championship still on the line.


If you're looking to see what's on the line as these 25 and a few hundred of their closest ~~friends~~ competitors square off this weekend in Sydney, I recommend [this piece by Rich Hagon](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-eldritch-moon-preview-part-2-2016-08-02), which details (and I mean details) everything you might need to know.
