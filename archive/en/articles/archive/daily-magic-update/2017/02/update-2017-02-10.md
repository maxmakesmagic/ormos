The February 10, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 10, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Grand Prix Pittsburgh and the crush of traffic (Vehicles, get it?! Man I'm funny) coming its way this weekend.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [Grand Prix Pittsburgh](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppit17) | [Twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)

The first Grand Prix since the Pro Tour, Pittsburgh welcomes Standard players from around the world to see what they learned from [Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer). Will Mardu Vehicles continue to do that thing that you do? Or will a counter-play rise? The action starts at 10 a.m. ET/7 a.m. PT on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


What to Watch Right Now
=======================


1. *Aether Revolt* Single Card Spotlights

There were a number of key cards that helped define Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*, and the enterprising coverage team highlighted four of them for your viewing pleasure. Published just in time for Grand Prix Pittsburgh, these are four defining cards for Standard, so pay attention.

Today's Must
============


1. [Should We Ban Scrapheap Scrounger?](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/scrapheap-scrounger/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

As someone who mostly plays control, this at least perked my ears up. [Scrapheap Scrounger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger) is very good, and it did very, very well at Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*. But just how good is it?


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Art in Focus—Kari-Zev's Expertise by Jason Rainville](https://www.originalmagicart.store/blogs/oma-blog/art-in-focus-kari-zevs-expertise-by-jason-rainville) | Original Magic Art | Josh Krause and Jason Rainville

Pretty much everyone loves our resident Kaladeshi sky Pirate, Kari-Zev, and here the artist of her Expertise, Jason Rainville, walks through and illustrates his process for creating the action-packed art that truly evokes a feeling of raiding skyships.


1. [Three Decks We Didn't Play](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/3-decks-we-didnt-play/) | ChannelFireball | Joel Larsson

Joel Larsson covers three decks his team—ChannelFireball Ice—chose *not* to play at Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*, but which might be good under the right circumstances.


1. [Lots of Level Ups](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-375-lots-of-level-ups/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

There are a ton of tiny ways to improve your game. Things like tapping mana correctly or never playing [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) or definitely passing me that Masterpiece if you're sitting next to me. You know, the little things.


1. [Notes on the Aftermath of Dominance](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34538_Notes-On-The-Aftermath-Of-Dominance.html) | StarCityGames.com | Zac Hill

Wait, Zac Hill? The same Zac Hill who left Wizards R&D to go save the world? He's back? Writing again? In true Zac Hill fashion, he has a lengthy, informative article today that covers the Pro Tour, what it means, and what went down.


1. [Modern Revolution: *Aether Revolt*](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/lee-shi-tian/modern-revolution-aether-revolt) | MTG Mint Card | Lee Shi Tian

*Aether Revolt* has the potential to make a huge splash in Modern, and with multiple Modern Grand Prix coming up, this is a good time to look at the cards likely to make waves. Lee Shi Tian thinks this might be one of the most impactful sets for Modern in a long time, so check out what he has to say and see if anything tickles your Modern fancy.


All. Coins. Must. Go!
=====================


1. [*Magic Duels* Coins Sale](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-duels)

*Magic Duels* is having a sale on coins for iOS now through February 15. You can get up to 40% off coin bundles in the Apple app store. If you play *Duels*, you already know what to do. If you don't, [check it out here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-duels).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Samuel Tharmaratnam's Black-Red Aggro](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer/24-26-point-standard-decklists-2017-02-04)

Who needs white? Not Samuel Tharmaratnam (say that three times fast—or just once).


Eschewing the white part of Mardu Vehicles, Tharmaratnam came within shouting distance of the Top 8 in the late rounds of Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* by piloting this aggressive black and red and definitely not Mardu deck to an 8-2 record.


The deck has a few things going for it over Mardu. One, the mana base is better. Two, it has an easier time playing [Inventor's Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventor%27s+Apprentice) on turn one. And three, [Forerunner of Slaughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forerunner+of+Slaughter) and [Weldfast Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weldfast+Engineer) are both aggressive and priced to move.


However, it lacks in [Toolcraft Exemplar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toolcraft+Exemplar), possibly the best aggressive creature in the format, and [Thraben Inspector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector), one of the best ways to ensure an early artifact. Instead the deck has [Bomat Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier) which, while powerful, doesn't even attack into the aforementioned [Thraben Inspector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector)—which is a bit of a problem.


[Incendiary Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Flow), however, is a nice touch for this deck. Not only does it go to the face, but it's one of the few spells in Standard that can permanently put [Scrapheap Scrounger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger) on the scrapheap.
