GRAND PRIX GUANGZHOU 2016
=========================




Ryoichi Tamada, Lim Zhong Yi and Jia Hao are the only three undefeated players at Grand Prix Guangzhou!
















GRAND PRIX GUANGZHOU 2016
-------------------------




* [Day 1 Coverage](#tabs-0)


Day 1 Coverage



946 showed up at the inaugural Grand Prix Guangzhou with their trusty Modern decks, but only so many players can go undefeated. In our case, we've got three players at 9-0 and none at 8-0-1. This means our heroic trio are way ahead of the pack and have a significantly less arduous path to the Top 8 tomorrow!


No. 22-ranked Ryoichi Tamada, the highest ranked player in the room, is top in Swiss with U/R Pyromancer Ascension, closely followed by Lim Zhong Yi with Death's Shadow Aggro and Jia Hao with Naya Burn.


Despite having a comparatively easier route to the Top 8, a bunch of talent are hot on their heels. Japanese superstars Kentaro Yamamoto and Yuuki Ichikawa will attempt to take the crown, as will two Singaporeans with Pro Tour Top 8s (Kelvin Chew and Albertus Law). Former Chinese National Champion and upcoming World Magic Cup attendee Yu Yin is also at 8-1.


Meanwhile, in the X-2 bracket, Tomoharu Saito, Jason Chung, Shuhei Nakamura, Zhang Zhiyang among others will try to elbow their way out of the bustling crowd. 289 players will return tomorrow for another six more intense rounds before the cut to the Top 8.


If you're still hungering for more Modern adventure, Grand Prix Lille and Grand Prix Indianapolis are underway and live coverage will be provided quite literally around the clock!


Just for this weekend, everybody's dancing in the Eldritch moonlight.
