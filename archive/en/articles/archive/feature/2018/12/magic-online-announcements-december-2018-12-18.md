State of *Magic Online* 2018
----------------------------


It's time to [leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leap) ahead and address the [elephant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201843) in the room: "What's going on with *Magic Online* now that MTG Arena is in the house?" The simple answer is MTGO will continue to offer a vastly different *Magic* experience in players' favorite formats. But that's not all!


Check out Chris's [article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/state-magic-online-2018-12-14) to get the lowdown on MTGO events, 2019's increased prize pool, and more.

This time around, you'll have through January 17 to try it out. See the full card list and the most recent changes [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).
