[_metadata_:description]:- "Known as one of the best constructed players of all time, it is no surprise that Shota Yasooka brought his own creation to Grand Prix Kobe. Yasooka is familiar with playing Blue-Black decks in Modern, opting to play Faeries at Pro Tour Born Of The Gods earlier this year. Today, however, he played a U/B Tezzeret Control Deck."
