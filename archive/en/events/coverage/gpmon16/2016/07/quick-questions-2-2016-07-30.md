### Which card are people playing in Eldritch Moon / Shadows over Innistrad sealed that they should not?

**Ricky Chin, Top 8 Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar:** [Lunarch Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lunarch+Mantle). I don't think it's playable at all.

**Gerard Fabiano, GP Montreal 2014 Champion:** I think people are overvaluing [Ruthless Disposal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Disposal).

**Frank Skarren, Two-Time Grand Prix Champion:** Any vanilla 2/2 for 2. You need your cards to do more than that.

**Lucas Siow, Grand Prix Toronto 2015 Champion:** [Murderer's Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderer%27s+Axe). You have to have a LOT of good reasons to justify playing this.

**Jamie Parke, 4 GP Top 8's:** Any one-toughness creature. There are a lot of cards that make them into liabilities.
