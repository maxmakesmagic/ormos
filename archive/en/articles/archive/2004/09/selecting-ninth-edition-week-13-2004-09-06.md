### Card Vote #13


For the final card vote of Selecting *Ninth Edition*, it’s the return of [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem). [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) was part of a contentious vote during [Selecting *Eighth Edition*](/en/articles/archive/selecting-eighth-edition-wrapup-2002-11-25), where it beat out [Crusade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusade), a result that surprised many of the readers (and Wizards of the Coast staff, for that matter). This time the Anthem is up against [Shared Triumph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Triumph), which affects only one creature type, but cost one less mana and only requires a single White. Triumph is more splashable, but may sometimes help the opponent out as well. Will [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) pull it out again to make a third core set in a row, or has [Shared Triumph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Triumph)’s time come? Vote now and find out next week!

### Flavor Text Vote


For the final vote of the promotion, we have the ten finalists for each card in the flavor text competition. The readers of **magicthegathering.com** sent us nearly 10,000 entries, and narrowing them all down to this list of finalists was no simple task (and not just because of the numbers involved). So here, to close out our promotion, are the final three votes of Selecting *Ninth Edition*. Pick your favorites and make sure to check back next week for the results as well as a complete wrap-up of all the other votes as well.

10. *"Once I saw a goblin shouting at a thunderstorm. He lost the argument pretty quickly."  

 -Wandering mage*

[**Editor’s Note:** As many had noticed, a submission slipped through that included a real world quote (contrary to the stated rules). In the interest of giving the voters (and submitters) the fairest shake, the voting for Shock has been cancelled this week. On Monday, September 13, we’ll include the corrected vote for Shock submissions, including the 11th place finisher in place of the Mark Twain submission. From there you’ll have a week to vote on your favorite. Thanks for your understanding and sorry for the delay. – Scott]


Thanks for voting and also to all who took the time to send in their flavor text ideas. Check back next week for the corrected Shock vote and the results from the other flavor text votes!
