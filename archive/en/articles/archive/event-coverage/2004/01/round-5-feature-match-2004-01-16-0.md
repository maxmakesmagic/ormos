![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptams04/fm8_1.jpg)These two are both Old Schoolers from their regions. Japan’s Osamu Fujita has been glowering his way to victory for some years now, and Norway’s Nicolai Herzog’s grin is practically trademarked. They also share the honor of having swept their first pod, well on their way to securing their seats for drafts three through five. Herzog opened with [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) and then threw down [Slagwurm Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagwurm+Armor) and [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb). Fujita made a mana Myr that was immediately outclassed by [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin). Making the best of a bad situation, he dropped [Barter in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood) to clear the board. As if to mock him, his deck served up [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). He spent his Spellbomb on Fujita’s [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker), and when he drew a second Spikeshot Fujita returned the favor. Neither had a play. Fujita dropped a [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow).

Fujita served up a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) only to lose it to Herzog’s [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate). Finally Herzog drew a man: [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr). He suited up with [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). Fujita made a [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) and tried to ping the Myr, but [Scale of Chiss-Goria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scale+of+Chiss-Goria) made the rescue. Next came a very frightening [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher). Fujita made one of his own, but without [Slagwurm Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagwurm+Armor) it was less than scary. He put his Longbow on it and took eight to the face. Herzog made a Diciple of the Vault and 

He made no play on his turn. He chumped, drew, and scooped.

Herzog 1 - Fujita 0

Herzog opened with [Talisman of Dominance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Dominance) and a late [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault). He [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter)ed it up but was stopped by a [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) from Fujita. Fujita fought back with a [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) but it fell to [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror). Then Herzog dropped [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher) and then [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker). Unfortunately for him, Fujita had made a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) and now had [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow). It shot down the Shrieker before Herzog could find his [Slagwurm Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagwurm+Armor).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptams04/fm8_2.jpg)Fujita made a Lasher of his own after falling to nine from Herzog’s. He hid behind his regenerating blocker. Herzog matched his [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem), and a turn later swung in. [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) took down his golem, and Fujita double blocked with Lasher and [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) to take down Herzog’s Lasher. Both went to the graveyard.

Now things were at a standstill. Herzog found a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and couldn’t get the Armor onto it fast enough. He also had a [Krark-Clan Grunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Grunt) and [Nuisance Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) helping his [Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes) fight past Fujita’s lone blocker. He drew dud after dud, and when Herzog found a second Spikeshot, that was game.
