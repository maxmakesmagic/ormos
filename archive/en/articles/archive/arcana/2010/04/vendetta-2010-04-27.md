Anyway you slice it (so to speak), "[Vendetta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendetta)" is a pretty serious name for a spell. The first time around, in *Mercadian Masques*, the art showed [Starke of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starke+of+Rath)—a familiar face to those following the storyline at the time—falling victim to his mind-controlled daughter Takara.

When [Vendetta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendetta) was reprinted in *Rise of the Eldrazi*, that storyline-specific art couldn't come along for the ride. Instead, we get to see someone else in the aftermath of a rather nasty death. And if you look closely, you'll see that it's another familiar face:

Need a hint? Check out the art description:



> A champion of the elves, an ally of the planeswalker [Nissa Revane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa+Revane), lies dead in the foreground. A single long-stemmed, deep-purple flower blooms right in front of the elf's corpse -- an assassin's magically spawned calling card. In the distant background we see the silhouette of a vampire walking away.

We're not sure who that particular member of [Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Chosen) crossed, but it didn't turn out so well for him!
