The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**Returning Theme: Five "Wedge" Clans**


The five three-color clans introduced in the *Khans of Tarkir* set return in this set. However, the events of the *Fate Reforged* set take place over a thousand years ago. In this era, the clans war not only against each other, but also against the fearsome dragons that threaten their survival. The clans of Tarkir's past strongly resemble the respective clans of the present day, and they employ some familiar themes and strategies. Each clan's icon returns, appearing on cards strongly associated with that clan, including cards with the clan's signature ability. These icons have no effect on game play.




---

**Theme: Five Dragon Broods and Their Leaders**


The *Fate Reforged* set features a cycle of five two-color legendary Dragons. These cards represent the leaders of the five distinct broods of dragons that inspired the cultures of the five clans on this world, and the dragons and clans have some overlap in mechanics. All the Dragon cards in the set have an icon in their text boxes that's similar to one of the five clan icons. These icons have no effect on game play.




---

**Abzan Keyword Action: Bolster**


Abzan is the white-black-green clan. Its clan icon is a crossed pair of dragon scales. Dromoka is the dragon who embodies the Abzan ideal of endurance.


Bolster is a new keyword action that puts +1/+1 counters on your smallest creature, ensuring there are no weak links in your army.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_cgh8joxscl.png)



Abzan Skycaptain  

3W  

Creature — Bird Soldier  

2/2  

Flying  

When Abzan Skycaptain dies, bolster 2. *(Choose a creature with the least toughness among creatures you control and put two +1/+1 counters on it.)*



The official rules for bolster are as follows:


701.30. Bolster


701.30a "Bolster N" means "Choose a creature you control with the least toughness or tied for least toughness among creatures you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature."



* Bolster itself doesn't target any creature, though some spells and abilities that bolster may have other effects that target creatures. For example, you could put counters on a creature with protection from white with Abzan Skycaptain's bolster ability.
* You determine which creature to put counters on as the spell or ability that instructs you to bolster resolves.



---

**Jeskai Keyword: Prowess**


Jeskai is the blue-red-white clan. Its clan icon is a dragon eye. Ojutai is the dragon who embodies the Jeskai ideal of cunning.


Prowess is a returning keyword that gives a creature a size bonus whenever you cast a noncreature spell. It hasn't changed since its appearance in the *Khans of Tarkir* set.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_zx9p9f6doj.png)



Jeskai Sage  

1U  

Creature — Human Monk  

1/1  

Prowess *(Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)*  

When Jeskai Sage dies, draw a card.



The official rules for prowess are as follows:


702.107. Prowess


702.107a Prowess is a triggered ability. "Prowess" means "Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn."


702.107b If a creature has multiple instances of prowess, each triggers separately.



* Any spell you cast that doesn't have the type creature will cause prowess to trigger. If a spell has multiple types, and one of those types is creature (such as an artifact creature), casting it won't cause prowess to trigger. Playing a land also won't cause prowess to trigger.
* Prowess triggers only once for any spell, even if that spell has multiple types.
* Prowess goes on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve before that spell.
* Once it triggers, prowess isn't connected to the spell that caused it to trigger. If that spell is countered, prowess will still resolve.



---

**Sultai Keyword: Delve**


Sultai is the black-green-blue clan. Its clan icon is a single dragon fang. Silumgar is the dragon who embodies the Sultai ideal of ruthlessness.


Delve is a returning keyword that lets you exile cards from your graveyard to help pay for spells. It hasn't changed since its appearance in the *Khans of Tarkir* set.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_6xssuor7cq.png)



Tasigur's Cruelty  

5B  

Sorcery  

Delve *(Each card you exile from your graveyard while casting this spell pays for 1.)*  

Each opponent discards two cards.



The official rules for delve are as follows:


702.65. Delve


702.65a Delve is a static ability that functions while the spell with delve is on the stack. "Delve" means "For each generic mana in this spell's total cost, you may exile a card from your graveyard rather than pay that mana." The delve ability isn't an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with delve is determined.


702.65b Multiple instances of delve on the same spell are redundant.



* You exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
* Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, the converted mana cost of Tasigur's Cruelty is 6 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
* You can't exile cards to pay for the colored mana requirements of a spell with delve.
* You can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than five cards from your graveyard to cast Tasigur's Cruelty.
* Because delve isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.



---

**Mardu Keyword: Dash**


Mardu is the red-white-black clan. Its clan icon is a pair of dragon wings. Kolaghan is the dragon who embodies the Mardu ideal of speed.


Dash is a keyword that lets you cast creature spells for an alternative cost, giving the creature haste and returning it to its owner's hand at the end of the turn.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_ohrremmpbu.png)



Goblin Heelcutter  

3R  

Creature — Goblin Berserker  

3/2  

Whenever Goblin Heelcutter attacks, target creature can't block this turn.  

Dash 2R *(You may cast this spell for its dash cost. If you do, it gains haste, and it's returned from the battlefield to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.)*



The official rules for dash are as follows:


702.108. Dash


702.108a Dash represents three abilities: two static abilities that function while the card with dash is on the stack, one of which may create a delayed triggered ability, and a static ability that functions while the object with dash is on the battlefield. "Dash [cost]" means "You may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost," "If you chose to pay this spell's dash cost, return the permanent this spell becomes to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step," and "As long as this permanent's dash cost was paid, it has haste." Paying a card's dash cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e–g.



* If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you're still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
* If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner's hand only if it's still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
* You don't have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
* If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose dash cost was paid, the copy won't have haste and won't be returned to its owner's hand.



---

**Temur Ability Word: Ferocious**


Temur is the green-blue-red clan. Its clan icon is a dragon's claws. Atarka is the dragon who embodies the Temur ideal of savagery.


Ferocious is a returning ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that improve if you control a creature with power 4 or greater. (An ability word has no rules meaning.) It hasn't changed since its appearance in the *Khans of Tarkir* set.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_5rwpeac6uj.png)



Winds of Qal Sisma  

1G  

Instant  

Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.  
*Ferocious* — If you control a creature with power 4 or greater, instead prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn by creatures your opponents control.






  
![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_42zl82wr70.png)



Shamanic Revelation  

3GG  

Sorcery  

Draw a card for each creature you control.  
*Ferocious* — You gain 4 life for each creature you control with power 4 or greater.




* Some ferocious abilities that appear on instants and sorceries use the word "instead." These spells have an upgraded effect if you control a creature with power 4 or greater as they resolve. For these, you only get the upgraded effect, not both effects.
* Ferocious abilities of instants and sorceries that don't use the word "instead" will provide an additional effect if you control a creature with power 4 or greater as they resolve.
* See the "Card-Specific Notes" section for cards with static or triggered ferocious abilities and more information about how they work.

**New Keyword Action: Manifest**


The Spirit Dragon Ugin and his magic are very much alive in Tarkir's past. Manifest is a new keyword action that puts cards onto the battlefield face down as 2/2 creatures, hiding their true identities. If a creature card is put onto the battlefield this way, you can turn it face up at any time by paying its mana cost.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_zbxsst2e97.png)



Formless Nurturing  

3G  

Sorcery  

Manifest the top card of your library, then put a +1/+1 counter on it. *(To manifest a card, put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)*



The official rules for manifest are as follows:


701.31. Manifest


701.31a "Manifest [a card]" means "Put [that card] onto the battlefield face down." That permanent is a 2/2 creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. That permanent is a manifested permanent as long as it's face down. The effect defining its characteristics works any time the card is face down and ends when it's turned face up.


701.31b Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested permanent you control face up. This is a special action that doesn't use the stack (see rule 115.2b). To do this, show all players that the card representing that permanent is a creature card and what its mana cost is, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. If the card representing that permanent isn't a creature card or doesn't have a mana cost, it can't be turned face up this way.


701.31c If a card with morph is manifested, its controller may use the procedure described in rule 702.36d to turn a face-down permanent with morph face up rather than the procedure described above to turn a manifested permanent face up.


701.31d If an effect instructs a player to manifest multiple cards from his or her library, those cards are manifested one at a time.


701.31e A face-down permanent represented by an instant or sorcery card can't be turned face up. If an effect instructs a player to turn one face up, its controller reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger whenever a permanent is turned face up won't trigger.


701.31f See rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and Permanents," for more information.



* The face-down permanent is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the permanent can still grant or change any of these characteristics.
* Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested creature face up by revealing that it's a creature card (ignoring any type-changing effects that might be applying to it) and paying its mana cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
* If a manifested creature would have morph if it were face up, you may also turn it face up by paying its morph cost.
* Unlike a face-down creature that was cast using the morph ability, a manifested creature may still be turned face up after it loses its abilities if it's a creature card.
* Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
* Because face-down creatures don't have a name, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
* A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
* Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
* At any time, you can look at a face-down permanent you control. You can't look at face-down permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
* If a face-down permanent you control leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
* You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for indicating this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield. You must also track how each became face down (manifested, cast face down using the morph ability, and so on).
* There are no cards in the *Fate Reforged* set that would turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it's an instant or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent turns face up won't trigger, because even though you revealed the card, it never turned face up.
* Some older *Magic* sets feature double-faced cards, which have a *Magic* card face on each side rather than a *Magic* card face on one side and a *Magic* card back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield still can't be turned face down.



---

**The Three "Forms"**


Three enchantment cards in the *Fate Reforged* set have enters-the-battlefield abilities that turn them into Auras, manifest a creature, and attach them to the manifested creature.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_686grbg2qw.png)



Cloudform  

1UU  

Enchantment  

When Cloudform enters the battlefield, it becomes an Aura with enchant creature. Manifest the top card of your library and attach Cloudform to it. *(To manifest a card, put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)*  

Enchanted creature has flying and hexproof.




* You'll still manifest the top card of your library even if the "Form" isn't on the battlefield as its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves.
* If you have no cards in your library as the ability resolves, the "Form" will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
* If the enchanted creature is turned face up, the "Form" will continue to enchant it.



---

**Cycle: Sieges**


The Sieges are a cycle of enchantments that ask you to declare your allegiance as they enter the battlefield.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_bpd2s95l5m.png)



Palace Siege  

3BB  

Enchantment  

As Palace Siege enters the battlefield, choose Khans or Dragons.  

• Khans — At the beginning of your upkeep, return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.  

• Dragons — At the beginning of your upkeep, each opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.




* Each Siege will have one of the two listed abilities, depending on your choice as it enters the battlefield.
* The words "Khans" and "Dragons" are anchor words, connecting your choice to the appropriate ability. Anchor words are a new rules concept. "[Anchor word] — [Ability]" means "As long as you chose [anchor word] as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability]." Notably, the anchor word "Dragons" has no connection to the creature type Dragon.
* Each of the last two abilities is linked to the first ability. They each refer only to the choice made as a result of the first ability. If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of one of the Sieges, its controller will make a new choice for that Siege. Which ability the copy has won't depend on the choice made for the original permanent.



---

**Cycle: Creatures with Modal Enters-the-Battlefield Abilities**


This set includes a cycle of creatures with modal enters-the-battlefield abilities. For each, you may choose either to put a +1/+1 counter on the creature or for another effect to happen.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_sh3p8myiyb.png)



Defiant Ogre  

5R  

Creature — Ogre Warrior 3/5  

When Defiant Ogre enters the battlefield, choose one —  

• Put a +1/+1 counter on Defiant Ogre.  

• Destroy target artifact.




* You choose which mode you're using as you put the ability on the stack, after the creature has entered the battlefield. Once you've chosen a mode, you can't change that mode even if the creature leaves the battlefield in response to that ability.
* If a mode requires a target and there are no legal targets available, you must choose the mode that adds a +1/+1 counter.



---

**Returning Mechanic: Hybrid Mana**


Hybrid mana symbols represent a cost that can be paid with either of two colors of mana. For example, B/G can be paid with either B or G. It's both a black and a green mana symbol.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_tewomwqgjt.png)



Daghatar the Adamant  

3W  

Legendary Creature — Human Warrior  

0/0  

Vigilance  

Daghatar the Adamant enters the battlefield with four +1/+1 counters on it.  

1B/GB/G: Move a +1/+1 counter from target creature onto a second target creature.




* Hybrid mana symbols appear only in costs. In the *Fate Reforged* set, these symbols appear in the costs of activated abilities or as costs paid as triggered abilities resolve.
* As you activate an activated ability with hybrid mana symbols in its cost, you choose which color of mana you will spend for each hybrid mana symbol. You do this at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for an X in a mana cost. For example, you choose whether you'll activate the ability of Daghatar the Adamant by paying 1BB, 1BG, or 1GG.
* A card with hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. There are no *Fate Reforged* cards with hybrid mana symbols in the mana cost.

Abzan Beastmaster  

2G  

Creature — Hound Shaman  

2/1  

At the beginning of your upkeep, draw a card if you control the creature with the greatest toughness or tied for the greatest toughness.




* The ability checks the creatures on the battlefield as it resolves to determine if you will draw a card.
* You'll draw a maximum of one card, even if you control multiple creatures tied for the greatest toughness.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_5qe8239b6r.png)



Alesha, Who Smiles at Death  

2R  

Legendary Creature — Human Warrior  

3/2  

First strike  

Whenever Alesha, Who Smiles at Death attacks, you may pay W/BW/B. If you do, return target creature card with power 2 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped and attacking.




* You choose which opponent or opposing Planeswalker the creature is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or Planeswalker Alesha is attacking.
* Although the creature you return is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_w8pqbpq5jj.png)



Ambush Krotiq  

5G  

Creature — Insect  

5/5  

Trample  

When Ambush Krotiq enters the battlefield, return another creature you control to its owner's hand.




* If you control no other creatures as Ambush Krotiq's triggered ability resolves, nothing happens. Ambush Krotiq remains on the battlefield.
* The triggered ability doesn't target any permanent. You choose which one to return as the ability resolves. No player can respond to this choice once the ability starts resolving.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_tcieq9nbxd.png)



Ancestral Vengeance  

BB  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

When Ancestral Vengeance enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control.  

Enchanted creature gets -1/-1.




* If the creature targeted by Ancestral Vengeance's enchant creature ability is an illegal target as Ancestral Vengeance tries to resolve, Ancestral Vengeance will be countered. It won't enter the battlefield, and its enters-the-battlefield ability won't trigger.
* If Ancestral Vengeance causes the enchanted creature to have toughness 0, that creature and Ancestral Vengeance will be put into their owners' graveyards. The enters-the-battlefield ability will still apply.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_9gjj83vdz8.png)



Arashin War Beast  

5GG  

Creature — Beast  

6/6  

Whenever Arashin War Beast deals combat damage to one or more blocking creatures, manifest the top card of your library. *(Put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)*




* Arashin War Beast's ability will trigger only once per combat damage step, no matter how many creatures are blocking it.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_ayf3tb0eak.png)



Arcbond  

2R  

Instant  

Choose target creature. Whenever that creature is dealt damage this turn, it deals that much damage to each other creature and each player.




* The creature is the source of the new damage. If you control that creature as it deals damage, you may choose to redirect that damage from an opponent to a Planeswalker he or she controls.
* The delayed triggered ability Arcbond creates will trigger even if the target creature is dealt lethal damage. For example, if a 3/3 creature is targeted by Arcbond and later in the turn it blocks a 7/7 creature, the 3/3 creature will deal 7 damage each other creature and each player.
* Damage dealt by the creature because of the ability Arcbond creates isn't combat damage, even if it was combat damage that caused the ability to trigger.
* If two Arcbonds have resolved targeting different creatures, and damage is dealt to one of them, the delayed triggered ability will cause that creature to deal damage to each other creature and player. This will cause the delayed triggered ability from the other Arcbond to trigger. The second creature will then deal damage to each other creature and player. This will continue until one or both of the creatures die or the game ends. If this doesn't happen (perhaps because both creatures have indestructible and damage dealt to the players is being prevented), and no player breaks the loop, the game will be a draw.

Archfiend of Depravity  

3BB  

Creature — Demon  

5/4  

Flying  

At the beginning of each opponent's end step, that player chooses up to two creatures he or she controls, then sacrifices the rest.




* The opponent chooses which creatures to spare, if any, as the ability resolves. This choice doesn't target the creatures.
* The opponent may choose to spare one or no creatures. If the player doesn't choose any creatures, he or she will sacrifice all creatures he or she controls.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_dao3xzedis.png)



Battle Brawler  

1B  

Creature — Orc Warrior  

2/2  

As long as you control a red or white permanent, Battle Brawler gets +1/+0 and has first strike.




* If Battle Brawler assigns combat damage during the first combat damage step, and then it loses first strike before the second combat damage step (perhaps because you no longer control a red or white permanent), it won't assign combat damage again in the second combat damage step.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_fiu77hjf1z.png)



Battlefront Krushok  

4G  

Creature — Beast  

3/4  

Battlefront Krushok can't be blocked by more than one creature.  

Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it can't be blocked by more than one creature.




* The second ability applies only as blockers are declared. If a creature you control with no +1/+1 counters on it becomes blocked by more than one creature, putting a +1/+1 counter on it won't change or undo the block.

Break Through the Line  

1R  

Enchantment  

R: Target creature with power 2 or less gains haste until end of turn and can't be blocked this turn.




* If the creature's power is greater than 2 as the activated ability tries to resolve, the ability will be countered and none of its effects will happen. However, if the creature's power is raised above 2 after the ability resolves, it will still have haste and can't be blocked that turn.

Brutal Hordechief  

3B  

Creature — Orc Warrior  

3/3  

Whenever a creature you control attacks, defending player loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.  

3R/WR/W: Creatures your opponents control block this turn if able, and you choose how those creatures block.




* All blocking declarations must still be legal.
* If there's a cost associated with having a creature block and you choose for that creature to block, its controller can choose to pay that cost or not. If that player decides to not pay that cost, you must propose a new set of blocking creatures.
* You'll choose how each creature controlled by an opponent blocks, even if that creature wasn't on the battlefield or wasn't controlled by an opponent as the activated ability resolved.
* In a multiplayer game, if more than one player activates Brutal Hordechief's activated ability on the same turn, the controller of the last ability to resolve will choose how any creatures controlled by players who didn't resolve this ability will block.
* The defending player affected by Brutal Hordechief's triggered ability is determined relative to the creature that attacked. For example, if Brutal Hordechief attacked one opponent and two other creatures you control attacked another opponent, the first opponent would lose 1 life and the second opponent would lose 2 life. You'd gain a total of 3 life.

Channel Harm  

5W  

Instant  

Prevent all damage that would be dealt to you and permanents you control this turn by sources you don't control. If damage is prevented this way, you may have Channel Harm deal that much damage to target creature.




* Channel Harm's only target is the creature it may deal damage to. You choose that target as you cast Channel Harm, not at the time it prevents damage.
* If the target creature is an illegal target as Channel Harm tries to resolve, the entire spell is countered. No damage will be prevented.
* Whether the target creature is still a legal target is not checked after Channel Harm resolves. Damage will still be prevented, even if Channel Harm can't deal damage to that creature.
* Channel Harm's effect is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, you may have Channel Harm (not the original source) deal damage to the creature as part of that prevention effect. Channel Harm is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect the new damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
* You can choose a creature you control as the target. If you do, the damage Channel Harm deals to that creature won't be prevented.
* If two players have each cast Channel Harm targeting a creature the other controls, and a source one player controls would deal damage to the second player or a permanent that player controls, one Channel Harm will prevent that damage and try to deal damage to the creature controlled by the first player. That player's Channel Harm will then prevent that damage and try to deal damage to the creature controlled by the second player. This forms a loop that either player can break by choosing to not have Channel Harm try to deal damage. It doesn't matter which player breaks the loop, as no damage will be dealt in either case.

Collateral Damage  

R  

Instant  

As an additional cost to cast Collateral Damage, sacrifice a creature.  

Collateral Damage deals 3 damage to target creature or player.




* If you sacrifice an attacking or blocking creature during the declare blockers step, it won't deal combat damage. If you wait until the combat damage step, but that creature is dealt lethal damage, it'll be destroyed before you get a chance to sacrifice it.
* You must sacrifice exactly one creature to cast this spell; you can't cast it without sacrificing a creature, and you can't sacrifice additional creatures.
* Players can respond to Collateral Damage only after it's been cast and all its costs have been paid. No one can try to destroy the creature you sacrificed to stop you from casting this spell.

Crucible of the Spirit Dragon

T: Add 1 to your mana pool.  

1, T: Put a storage counter on Crucible of the Spirit Dragon.  

T, Remove X storage counters from Crucible of the Spirit Dragon: Add X mana in any combination of colors to your mana pool. Spend this mana only to cast Dragon spells or activate abilities of Dragons.




* You can use mana generated by the last ability to pay an alternative cost (such as a dash cost) or an additional cost to cast a Dragon spell. It's not limited to paying just that spell's mana cost.
* An activated ability appears in the form "Cost: Effect."
* Notably, turning a face-down creature face up isn't an activated ability. If you manifest a Dragon creature card or cast a Dragon creature card face down using the morph ability, you can't use mana generated by the last ability to turn that card face up.
* The mana generated by the last ability can't be spent to activate abilities of Dragon sources that aren't on the battlefield.

If one target (but not both) is illegal as Cunning Strike resolves, it deals damage to the remaining legal target and you draw a card. If both targets are illegal, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't draw a card in that case.

0/0  

Vigilance  

Daghatar the Adamant enters the battlefield with four +1/+1 counters on it.  

1B/GB/G: Move a +1/+1 counter from target creature onto a second target creature.




* The two targets of the last ability must be different creatures. Either one may be Daghatar the Adamant.
* The +1/+1 counter is moved only if both targets are still legal as the ability resolves.
* To move a counter from one creature to another, the counter is removed from the first creature and placed on the second. Any abilities that care about a counter being placed on the second creature will apply.

Dragonrage  

2R  

Instant  

Add R to your mana pool for each attacking creature you control. Until end of turn, attacking creatures you control gain "R: This creature gets +1/+0 until end of turn."




* Even though it can generate mana, Dragonrage isn't a mana ability. It uses the stack and can be responded to.
* Only creatures that are attacking as Dragonrage resolves will count toward how much mana is generated, and only those creatures will gain the "firebreathing" activated ability. In other words, casting Dragonrage before you've declared attackers usually won't do anything.
* Remember that unused mana empties from players' mana pools at the end of each step and phase. For example, if you cast Dragonrage during your declare attackers step, except in very rare cases, the mana Dragonrage generates won't last until the declare blockers step or the postcombat main phase.

Specifically, the creature you control with the lowest toughness as the first such ability resolves may not have the lowest toughness as the second such ability resolves.

3GU  

Instant  

Manifest the top two cards of your library. *(To manifest a card, put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)*




* The cards are manifested one at a time. It must remain clear which face-down creature was the top card of your library and which one was the second card of your library.
* If you're playing with the top card of your library revealed as Ethereal Ambush resolves (perhaps because you control a card such as [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix)), you'll manifest the top card, reveal the next card (now the top card), and then manifest that card.

Flamerush Rider  

4R  

Creature — Human Warrior  

3/3  

Whenever Flamerush Rider attacks, put a token onto the battlefield tapped and attacking that's a copy of another target attacking creature. Exile the token at end of combat.  

Dash 2RR *(You may cast this spell for its dash cost. If you do, it gains haste, and it's returned from the battlefield to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.)*




* You choose which opponent or opposing Planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or Planeswalker Flamerush Rider is attacking.
* Although the token is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Notably, it doesn't copy any effects that may have turned a noncreature permanent into a creature. If the token isn't a creature as it enters the battlefield, it won't be attacking.
* If the copied creature had X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token created by Flamerush Rider copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
* If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, you won't exile that creature at end of combat. However, if Flamerush Rider creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (like the one [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) creates), you'll exile each of those tokens.

Flamewake Phoenix

Creature — Phoenix  

2/2  

Flying, haste  

Flamewake Phoenix attacks each turn if able.  
*Ferocious* — At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you control a creature with power 4 or greater, you may pay R. If you do, return Flamewake Phoenix from your graveyard to the battlefield.




* Flamewake Phoenix's ferocious ability triggers only if Flamewake Phoenix is in your graveyard and you control a creature with power 4 or greater at the beginning of combat on your turn. Additionally, the ability will check to see if you control a creature with power 4 or greater again as it resolves. If you don't, the ability will have no effect.
* You still choose which player or Planeswalker Flamewake Phoenix attacks.
* If, during your declare attackers step, Flamewake Phoenix is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having Flamewake Phoenix attack, you're not forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
* If Flamewake Phoenix enters the battlefield before the combat phase, it will attack that turn if able. If it enters the battlefield after combat, it won't attack that turn and will usually be available to block on the following turn.

* If Jeskai Infiltrator isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, you'll manifest just the top card of your library.
* A card's owner is public information at all times. If the two cards you exile are owned by different players (perhaps because you gained control of a Jeskai Infiltrator owned by your opponent), which card is which is no longer hidden from your opponent. That player will know which face-down creature he or she owns.

When Noxious Dragon dies, you may destroy target creature with converted mana cost 3 or less.




* A face-down creature has a converted mana cost of 0. However, its converted mana cost changes when it's turned face up. Thus, if a creature is turned face up in response to being targeted by Noxious Dragon's ability, it may become an illegal target.

Ojutai, Soul of Winter  

5WU  

Legendary Creature — Dragon  

5/6  

Flying, vigilance  

Whenever a Dragon you control attacks, tap target nonland permanent an opponent controls. That permanent doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.




* The triggered ability can target a nonland permanent that's already tapped. That permanent won't untap during its controller's next untap step.
* The ability tracks the permanent, but not its controller. If the permanent changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.
* The ability only applies during the controller's next untap step, even if the permanent has been the target of Ojutai's triggered ability more than once. The permanent won't stay tapped through multiple untap steps.

Orc Sureshot  

3B  

Creature — Orc Archer  

4/2  

Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, target creature an opponent controls gets -1/-1 until end of turn.




* If Orc Sureshot enters the battlefield under your control at the same time as another creature, its ability will trigger for that creature.

Outpost Siege  

3R  

Enchantment  

As Outpost Siege enters the battlefield, choose Khans or Dragons.  

• Khans — At the beginning of your upkeep, exile the top card of your library. Until end of turn, you may play that card.  

• Dragons — Whenever a creature you control leaves the battlefield, Outpost Siege deals 1 damage to target creature or player.




* The card exiled by the "Khans" ability is exiled face up. Playing a card exiled with the "Khans" ability follows the normal rules for playing the card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* If you exile a land card using the "Khans" ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
* If a noncreature card is manifested and then leaves the battlefield, the "Dragons" ability will trigger.

Pyrotechnics  

4R  

Sorcery  

Pyrotechnics deals 4 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures and/or players.




* The number of targets chosen for Pyrotechnics must be at least one and at most four. You choose how the damage is divided as you cast the spell, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage.
* If some but not all of Pyrotechnics's targets become illegal, you can't change the division of damage. Damage that would have been dealt to illegal targets simply isn't dealt.
* You can't deal damage to both a player and a Planeswalker that player controls using Pyrotechnics. You also can't deal damage to more than one Planeswalker controlled by the same player. If you choose to redirect the damage being dealt to a player to a Planeswalker, you must redirect all the damage to a single Planeswalker.
* If an effect creates a copy of Pyrotechnics, the number of targets and division of damage can't be changed. The effect that creates the copy may allow you to change the targets, however.

Rakshasa's Disdain  

2U  

Instant  

Counter target spell unless its controller pays 1 for each card in your graveyard.




* Count the number of cards in your graveyard as Rakshasa's Disdain resolves to determine how much mana the controller of the target spell must pay to avoid the spell being countered. Rakshasa's Disdain is still on the stack at this time and won't count toward this number.

Renowned Weaponsmith  

1U  

Creature — Human Artificer  

1/3  

T: Add 2 to your mana pool. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate abilities of artifacts.  

U, T: Search your library for a card named Heart-Piercer Bow or Vial of Dragonfire, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.




* You can use mana generated by the first ability to pay an alternative cost or an additional cost to cast an artifact spell. It's not limited to paying just that spell's mana cost.
* An activated ability appears in the form "Cost: Effect." Some keywords, including equip, are activated abilities.
* Notably, turning a face-down creature face up isn't an activated ability. If you manifest an artifact creature card or cast an artifact card face down using the morph ability, you can't use mana generated by the first ability to turn it face up.
* The mana generated by the first ability can't be spent to activate abilities of artifact sources that aren't on the battlefield.
* [Heart-Piercer Bow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart-Piercer+Bow) is a card from the *Khans of Tarkir* set. Vial of Dragonfire doesn't appear to have been invented yet. Curious.

Ruthless Instincts

Instant  

Choose one —  

• Target nonattacking creature gains reach and deathtouch until end of turn. Untap it.  

• Target attacking creature gets +2/+2 and gains trample until end of turn.




* If you choose the first mode, the target creature must not be attacking. However, it can attack later in the turn.

Sage's Reverie  

3W  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

When Sage's Reverie enters the battlefield, draw a card for each Aura you control that's attached to a creature.  

Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 for each Aura you control that's attached to a creature.




* An Aura doesn't necessarily need the enchant creature ability for the abilities of Sage's Reverie to count it. For example, an Aura with enchant permanent that's attached to a creature will count.
* Count the number of Auras you control attached to creatures as the enters-the-battlefield ability resolves to determine how many cards to draw. This will include Sage's Reverie as long as it's still on the battlefield at that time.

Scroll of the Masters  

2  

Artifact  

Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, put a lore counter on Scroll of the Masters.  

3, T: Target creature you control gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each lore counter on Scroll of the Masters.




* Count the number of lore counters on Scroll of the Masters as the activated ability resolves to determine how big a bonus the target creature gets. If Scroll of the Masters isn't on the battlefield at that time, use the number of lore counters on it when it left the battlefield.
* Once the activated ability has resolved, changing the number of lore counters on Scroll of the Masters won't affect the bonus that activation granted.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/ujehvsbfrf153/en_4mmteg78b4.png)



Shifting Loyalties  

5U  

Sorcery  

Exchange control of two target permanents that share a card type. *(Artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker are card types.)*




* If one of the target permanents is an illegal target when Shifting Loyalties resolves, the exchange won't happen. If both permanents are illegal targets (perhaps because they no longer share a card type), Shifting Loyalties will be countered.
* Either target can have card types the other does not, as long as they share at least one card type. For example, you could target a creature and an artifact creature.
* You don't have to control either target permanent.
* If the same player controls both permanents when Shifting Loyalties resolves, nothing happens.
* Gaining control of an Aura or Equipment doesn't cause it to move, though gaining control of an Equipment will allow you to activate its equip ability later to attach it to a creature you control.
* If another spell or ability allows you to change the targets of Shifting Loyalties (or perhaps copy it and choose new targets for the copy), you can change the targets only such that the final set of targets is still legal. For example, if Shifting Loyalties targets a creature you control and a creature an opponent controls, you couldn't change just the second target to a noncreature permanent controlled by that player. You could, however, change just the second target to a creature controlled by a different opponent. The two new targets can share a different card type than the two original targets did.

Silumgar, the Drifting Death  

4UB  

Legendary Creature — Dragon  

3/7  

Flying, hexproof  

Whenever a Dragon you control attacks, creatures defending player controls get -1/-1 until end of turn.




* The creatures affected by Silumgar's triggered ability are determined relative to the Dragon that attacked. For example, if Silumgar attacked one opponent and two other Dragons attacked another opponent, creatures controlled by the first opponent would get -1/-1 until end of turn and creatures controlled by the second opponent would get -2/-2 until end of turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, choose one member of the opposing team as each ability resolves.

Soulfire Grand Master  

1W  

Creature — Human Monk  

2/2  

Lifelink  

Instant and sorcery spells you control have lifelink.  

2U/RU/R: The next time you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand this turn, put that card into your hand instead of into your graveyard as it resolves.




* An instant or sorcery spell with lifelink causes its controller to gain life only if it's the source of any damage that's dealt. An instant or sorcery spell with lifelink that causes another source to deal damage won't cause its controller to gain life.
* After you activate Soulfire Grand Master's last ability, if the next instant or sorcery spell you cast from your hand is countered, it won't be put into your hand and the effect won't be applied to the next spell you cast.
* A spell that instructs you to exile it (for example, Temporal Trespass) won't be put into your hand because it's not put into your graveyard as it resolves.

Soulflayer  

4BB  

Creature — Demon  

4/4  

Delve *(Each card you exile from your graveyard while casting this spell pays for 1.)*  

If a creature card with flying was exiled with Soulflayer's delve ability, Soulflayer has flying. The same is true for first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, reach, trample, and vigilance.




* Creature cards that have abilities that grant the listed keyword abilities to themselves won't count. For example, exiling a Battle Brawler (a creature with "As long as you control a red or white permanent, Battle Brawler gets +1/+0 and has first strike") with Soulflayer's delve ability won't cause Soulflayer to have first strike, even if you control a red or white permanent.
* You can't exile more cards from your graveyard than you'd need to pay Soulflayer's generic mana requirement. In most situations, this means you can't exile more than four cards, even if you want to exile more to give it extra abilities.

Sudden Reclamation  

3G  

Instant  

Put the top four cards of your library into your graveyard, then return a creature card and a land card from your graveyard to your hand.




* You choose which creature card and land card to return to your hand as Sudden Reclamation resolves. This doesn't target either card.
* If there are no land cards in your graveyard, you still choose a creature card to return, and vice versa.

Supplant Form  

4UU  

Instant  

Return target creature to its owner's hand. You put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of that creature.




* The token copies exactly what was printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature was copying something else or was a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If you return a face-down creature to its owner's hand, the token will be a face-up colorless 2/2 creature with no name, no abilities, and no creature types. (The face-down creature card will be revealed to all players as it leaves the battlefield.)
* If the copied creature had X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied creature was copying something else, the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token created by Supplant Form copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.

Tasigur, the Golden Fang

Legendary Creature — Human Shaman

Delve *(Each card you exile from your graveyard while casting this spell pays for 1.)*  

2G/UG/U: Put the top two cards of your library into your graveyard, then return a nonland card of an opponent's choice from your graveyard to your hand.




* The last ability doesn't target any card or player. You choose an opponent as the ability resolves and that player chooses a nonland card.
* The chosen opponent can choose any nonland card in your graveyard, not just one of the cards that was just put there. The player must choose a nonland card if there's one in your graveyard.

Instant  

Target creature gains double strike until end of turn. *(It deals both first-strike and regular combat damage.)*  
*Ferocious* — That creature also gains trample until end of turn if you control a creature with power 4 or greater.




* If all creatures blocking a creature with double strike and trample are destroyed during the first combat damage step, the creature with double strike and trample will deal all its combat damage to the defending player or Planeswalker during the second combat damage step.

Whenever Torrent Elemental attacks, tap all creatures defending player controls.  

3B/GB/G: Put Torrent Elemental from exile onto the battlefield tapped. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.




* "Defending player" refers to the player Torrent Elemental is attacking or the controller of the Planeswalker Torrent Elemental is attacking. In multiplayer formats that allow attacking multiple players, creatures controlled by other players won't be tapped, even if you control other creatures attacking those players or Planeswalkers those players control. In a Two-Headed Giant game, choose one member of the opposing team as the triggered ability resolves.

+2: Ugin, the Spirit Dragon deals 3 damage to target creature or player.  

−X: Exile each permanent with converted mana cost X or less that's one or more colors.  

−10: You gain 7 life, draw seven cards, then put up to seven permanent cards from your hand onto the battlefield.




* If you choose to put permanent cards with morph onto the battlefield with the third ability, you must put them onto the battlefield face up.
* Ugin, the Spirit Dragon is not a Dragon card; that is, he doesn't have the creature type Dragon. Spells and abilities that refer to Dragon cards or Dragons don't apply to Ugin.

Warden of the First Tree  

G  

Creature — Human  

1/1  

1W/B: Warden of the First Tree becomes a Human Warrior with base power and toughness 3/3.  

2W/BW/B: If Warden of the First Tree is a Warrior, it becomes a Human Spirit Warrior with trample and lifelink.  

3W/BW/BW/B: If Warden of the First Tree is a Spirit, put five +1/+1 counters on it.




* Neither the first nor the second ability has a duration. If one of them resolves, it will remain in effect until Warden of the First Tree leaves the battlefield or some subsequent effect changes its characteristics.
* The first and second activated abilities cause Warden of the First Tree to lose any other creature types it has. It retains any card types or supertypes it may have.
* The first ability overwrites any previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after the first ability resolves will overwrite this effect.
* Effects that modify Warden of the First Tree's power or toughness, such as the one created by [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth), will apply to Warden of the First Tree no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any +1/+1 counters on Warden of the First Tree and effects that switch its power and toughness.

As long as Wardscale Dragon is attacking, defending player can't cast spells.




* "Defending player" refers to the player Wardscale Dragon is attacking or the controller of the Planeswalker Wardscale Dragon is attacking.

* The defending player can still activate abilities or take special actions, such as turning a face-down creature face up.

Sacrifice Whisperwood Elemental: Until end of turn, face-up nontoken creatures you control gain "When this creature dies, manifest the top card of your library."

* Will of the Naga tracks the creatures, but not their controllers. If any of those creatures changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.
* If you chose two targets and one is an illegal target as Will of the Naga resolves, that creature won't become tapped and it won't be stopped from untapping during its controller's next untap step. It won't be affected by Will of the Naga in any way.

* Other players won't know whether the card you manifest is the top card or second card of that library.
