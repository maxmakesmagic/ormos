After last weekend's pair of Standard tournaments, it's time to take a break from the format for a weekend with tournaments bringing you a little bit of Modern and Legacy love, respectively.

First up is [Grand Prix Omaha](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-omaha-2015), North America's first Modern Grand Prix since the release of *Khans of Tarkir*. Europe has had two in the last few months, but this will be the first time we can see not only how the format has evolved from GP Madrid and Milan last year, but also what differs in deck preferences between Europe's and North America's *Magic* players.



The last Modern Grand Prix featured a variety of archetypes in the Top 8, with the sole repeat archetype—Birthing Pod—going head-to-head in the final match. Will [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) once again be crowned victorious, or will it be dethroned by one of the archetypes fueled by the delve draw power of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) or [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time)?



Join hosts Marshall Sutcliffe, Hall of Famer Ben Stark, Brian David-Marshall, Rashad Miller, Rusty Kubis, and Rich Castle as they bring you live Modern action from Omaha. Coverage begins on the official [*Magic* Twitch Channel tomorrow](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) at 1 p.m. local time (CT)/11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET/7 p.m. GMT. Day Two begins on Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (CT)/7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET/3 p.m. GMT.
