 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






 Both players began the semifinals period resolving other spells on the stack: The logistics of flights and hotels in the face of Grand Prix success. Earning his second Grand Prix Top 8, Brandon Nelson had already dispatched one professional *Magic* veteran, Jamie Parke, in his quarterfinal match. Taking aim with his powerful [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) and burn deck, he was confident facing down another longtime player.




 17th-ranked Eric Froehlich had overcome his quarterfinal opponent through similar means. Also packing the powerful Pilgrim-Ward duo, Froehlich instead added blue to his impressive arsenal. With [Illusory Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Angel), [Quickling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quickling), and a few bounce spells, what Froehlich lacked in reach he made up for in evasion and tricks. The three copies of [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge) alongside it all didn't hurt either.




**The Games**




 Froehlich started the match attacking, using [Frost Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Lynx) and [Kinsbaile Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Skirmisher) to slip past Nelson's [Midnight Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Guard). While Froehlich jumped ahead in the life race, Nelson's Heliod's Pilgrim pulled the powerful [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) out of his deck.




 However, Nelson was missing both Mountains and a fifth land, stranding his powerful red cards and leaving room for Froehlich to run unimpeded. Attacking aggressively, Froehlich used one [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge) to win a round of combat, then another to demolish what Nelson had left.






*Brandon Nelson fell in the first game, forcing him to aim at winning two back-to-back against his own combo.*
