Below are a few sketches from the *Mirrodin* Style Guide, which is a document given to artists that worked on the set for reference. This first sketch shows a Leonin, the race of cat humanoids associated with the color White (see also "[Mirrodin Environments: White](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-white-2003-10-01)"). Note how the Leonin, like most races on the plane of Mirrodin, has its flesh fused and intermingled with metal. 

 These sketches inspired the illustrations in such creature cards as [Leonin Abunas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas), [Leonin Den-Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Den-Guard), [Leonin Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder), and [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), and the artifact cards [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) (left) and [Leonin Sun Standard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Sun+Standard). 

Leonin claws (below) are nasty metallic structures!
