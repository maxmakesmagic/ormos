Ah, the no-theme week. I can write whatever I want! (Actually, with Scott Johns out of the office due to the birth of his second child—congrats!—I could probably write whatever I wanted anyhow.) This week, I'll be tackling that ever-growing monster of an Inbox that stares back at me from the screen every morning. That's right, it's mail bag week.


First, a sanity check on last week's shenanigans:

To the point—it was part of an April Fools' joke. I hoped everyone understood that, but there are people reading this site for whom English isn't their first language, and who don't live in countries where April Fools' Day means anything. So I'll explain it plainly. My "non-premium" article last week was meant to be as devoid of content as possible. The ["premium" article](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/out-control-2005-04-01-1) was a bunch of made up stuff, mostly half-truths, allowing me to have some fun at the expense of my readers and my coworkers. I promise that my non-joke columns will (usually) be heavier on the content.

Thanks, Andy. I'm doing fine now (thanks to all the well-wishers out there!). I'm actually an old hand at winding up in the hospital, as I'm a bit accident-prone. My wife prays for my daughter's sake that it isn't hereditary.


Glad you like Winston Draft. Hopefully it'll catch on, as I feel it addresses all the shortcomings of other one-on-one draft formats.



> 
> I got confused about the piles... When you choose to draft a pile, do you take the whole thing (as you mentioned in your example: 8 cards), or do you just pick 1 out of the pile?

When you take a pile, Dan, you take the whole thing. While it's true that one player can have many more cards than the other, it's usually because he has so many more sub-par cards. If you just draft good cards, it doesn't matter how many cards you have total, just how many of them are good enough to have an impact on the match. I've never seen anyone end up with so few cards that it wasn't possible to build a reasonable deck.

But if that's where the draft got its name from then how did Richard tie Winston Smith up to the drafting format?

Fox, I read *1984* years ago in high school. Great story. My favorite piece on "negative Utopia," however, is a short story by Kurt Vonnegut called "Harrison Bergeron." Check it out.


Sadly, Richard Garfield's name for Winston Draft isn't quite as profound as you might guess. Quite the opposite, actually. That draft mechanic was originally designed by Richard for a game using a regular 52-card deck of playing cards. He tested that particular game with guys around the office here using a deck of cards with the "Winston" cigarette logo on the back. So when the draft was adapted to **Magic** cards, the name "Winston" came with it. No kidding.

An interesting solution to a strange problem, zoi. While we'd never disclose plans to reprint any particular card or group of cards -— so please read nothing into this answer —- anything is fair game that isn't on the Reserved List, including cards from all three *Portal* sets.

Kyle, Horsemanship is not a very well-designed mechanic in the big picture of the game. Sure, it had its place in the P3K set from a mechanical and flavor standpoint (the set needed an evasion mechanic, and the source material didn't contain very many flying creatures).


Flying works well in **Magic** because of its own history—there are plenty of flying creatures available to deckbuilders to stop other people's flying attackers. Horsemanship would be like starting a new plane of battle. We tried that with Shadow in *Tempest*, and that was quite problematic (the creatures were essentially unblockable all the time). Granted, we may try starting another field of battle in the future, but with something a little more imaginative than a direct copy of the flying ability. In short, most likely not.


Vintage player I@n DeGraff sent me a message regarding some *Portal* cards the DCI should be cautious of, but then continued with some comments on the [Trinisphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) banning (and a postscript on [Sway of the Stars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sway+of+the+Stars), of all things).

This card is more powerful then Mind's Desire in vintage. This article frustrated some Vintage players as they viewed it as a sign that Vintage players aren't thought of in the development process.
>

I@n's comments on [Trinisphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) are telling—his experience with the card's effect on his local community is a mirror of what we saw happening in Standard with Ravager Affinity. Experienced players could process the card for what it was, but that doesn't mean it wasn't ruining the experiences of other players. A balanced environment means nothing if there's no one to play in it.


As for [Sway of the Stars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sway+of+the+Stars), tell your friends not to fear. Many designers submit cards without fully comprehending their power level, and we like it that way. They come up with crazy ideas, and it is up to the development team to run the cards through the wringer and come up with final costing and wording. The fact that Sway cost four mana coming out of design is about as important as its playtest name being "Plan B"; there was no way the card was going to get printed like that. Design may not foresee their creations' impact on constructed **Magic**, but they don't really need to. That's what development is for. And yes, Vintage players are thought of. (Ever wonder why [Rith's Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rith%27s+Grove) has the phrase "non-Lair land" in its rules text? Vintage.)

If Ravager had "1, sac an artifact:.." and disciple didn't cause loss of life, and Cranial [Plating]'s equip cost was reasonable, the whole deck moves towards good, but not broken.

We screwed up! Haven't I been saying that all along? If cards are getting banned in Standard or Block Constructed, we did something wrong. I have no problem admitting that, and have done so previously. I was not trying in any way to somehow first anthropomorphize and then *blame* artifact lands for anything that R&D did wrong. I was merely implying that if we had to go back and develop the block over again, artifact lands probably wouldn't have been there, or would have been seriously powered down (by being Legendary or via some other change). Either they would have to go or lots of other cards would have to get weaker, and I think the least-safe part of the equation was the lands, as they must be taken into account every single time you make a card that cares about how many artifacts you have in play.


I am glad to hear, however, that you like *Kamigawa* block.


Good words from the front lines:



> 
> I would like to make some comments on the banning in Standard and the future metagame. First, I would like to mention that I am one of the few players who have played since Beta. Not that this matters, but it reflects my experience with the game and with past blocks and formats. When *Mirrodin* block was first released I was very excited. I was the first set in a while that seemed to have some powerful cards that would not only be useful in standard but in other formats as well (in hindsight this is an understatement). I was one of the MTG forum members to piece together KCI. But more recently I had put away all my cards having to do with Standard. I was tired of always having to play the same 2-3 decks, and having to pack artifact hate in with any new deck idea. IT WAS BOORING.
> 
> 
> Now, post ban, I am enjoying the environment so much more. I have just recently posted a KCI-Life deck on the MTG KCI forum. Even without the artifact lands it is very competitive. But, more importantly, I have been playing new decks almost constantly. Each person I meet has new ideas, and all seem competitive. The format is brimming with ideas, and players trying them. It is a very exciting time in Standard. I know that you have been getting dumped on for your decision, but let me tell you that it was the right one and I for one applaud you for your decisive action.

There were many Friday nights when only six people showed up, and we decided to play the tournament as "round robin" instead of "Swiss pairings"

Right you are, Wilmar. I was too hasty in saying we don't make 0-mana abilities that can be used multiple times, because we obviously do. Personally, they make me slightly nervous, but the development teams for the sets that include those cards found little reason to worry.


The "Life" deck can still exist post-rotation with [Shuko](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shuko), [Daru Spiritualist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Spiritualist), and [Starlit Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlit+Sanctum) (there are other ways as well), but I don't expect it to be as fast or resilient in the new Extended as it is in the current.



> 
> Given that Extended now appears to be one of the best formats the game has ever seen in terms of diversity of the field, are you considering rolling back the plans to rotate out the Rath, Urza and MM blocks this fall? Looking at the results of the Philadelphia PTQ's, it's almost a different deck winning each tournament. Seems like it would be sad to see it go (in addition to watching [Energy Flux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Flux) rotate out and have Affinity rear its ugly head again). What are your thoughts?
> 
> 
> --Greg Ullmann

The format is definitely at a tipping point, Greg. The card pool is sufficiently large that, while lots of different decks are viable, they all have so many tools at their disposal that they can win (or set up an inevitable win) by turn three, and disrupting some of them is very difficult. If we keep adding sets to a format like that, something is going to break. The bigger a format, the faster it tends to be. We came up with this rotation plan years ago, and it still makes sense to implement. Here's an email that sees the format in a different light:



> 
> Aaron,
> 
> 
> You may like the current Extended. I, on the other hand, do not. The problem I have with Extended is that the number of sets involved greatly lends itself towards degenerate combo decks. When you have 5 blocks in play at any given time, card interactions are bound to surface that circumvent the usual deckbuilding rules. While I do not see a reasonable solution to the problem (unless you want to ban cards like [Daru Spiritualist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Spiritualist) and [Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren)), I also think Extended as a format is fundamentally flawed when you are forced to play discard, combo, or an aggro deck that is so fast that it is able to out-goldfish the combo decks. I know this is not an easy situation to manage but I hope that you guys are at least giving it some thought, that future sets are developed with some thought towards not only their impact on Standard but also on Extended as well.  
> 
> --Mark Schick
> 
> 
> 


Extended is already considered in development, but we can't really manage the format unless its size is kept, well, manageable. Rotation helps us in that way as well.


One interesting complaint I get from entrenched PTQ players is that an overly-diverse format is frustrating to compete in, since you feel that you have to practice against twenty different decks and choose how to use your sideboard slots somewhat haphazardly. This phenomenon won't prevent us from trying to make our formats more wide open, but it is interesting to see the other side of the coin.


And now on to some slightly less heavy material...

That's not a bad thing, Stephen. Part of the reason for putting "attributions" on Legends is to quickly give you a sense of what the character is about, and the other is to give you an alternate way of referring to them. We'd much rather have you call Meloku "The Clouded Mirror" than the super-generic "that five-mana 2/4 Moonfolk guy."

There's a good amount of back-and-forth here between design, development, and editing about where we can condense text into shorthand and where we can convert well-known abilities into keywords (like Vigilance). Milling wasn't high on our list of priorities, but it does seem to be a reasonable candidate, as it takes a lot of words to describe a relatively simple well-understood game action.


And yes, I remember taking part in some debates on random milling back when I was writing for StarCity, and I still maintain that it isn't very good. If you're going to mill someone, you should be doing so with an intent to win the game that way, not just to deny them a few random cards from their library.

That was a screw-up on my part. [Matsu-Tribe Sniper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matsu-Tribe+Sniper) has the normal Snake "stun" text that taps whatever it damages. So that little 1/1 can keep two fliers tied up by pinging them on alternating turns.

The card is definitely a centerpiece of the block environment, giving creature decks are really potent weapon, and you definitely have to build decks with it in mind. We felt we could make powerful Legendary cards like the Jitte once we settled on the new rules change; now the card is both threat and answer all in one.


From what we've been hearing from players preparing for the Pro Tour, the Jitte is not actually a part of all the top strategies, just a few of them. The Pro Tour will show us all just how good the card will be in the upcoming Pro Tour Qualifier season, but I don't expect to have to take any action against it (or any card in the block for that matter).

There is no need to even wonder about cards that are functionally identical to [Samite Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite+Healer). They are not being reprinted, the Healer is; don't even mention the starkly irrelevant others.

Your plan matches the one we settled on for *Ninth Edition*, Reuben. We will be errataing the cards we're reprinting —- [Samite Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite+Healer) will be Human -— but we're leaving everything else alone. I'm not going to go over the pluses and minuses of that decision, as I've talked it to death in several articles now, but suffice to say we felt that plan give us and you the most benefit.


And lastly, a Legacy concern:



> 
> You've given us a new format, and you've given us a name. However you need to do more. The format is languishing in the limbo that was Vintage like two years ago. There aren't any good prizes, tournaments or players. All the constructed style players aren't going to give up their Grand Prix and high profile tournaments for Legacy, and the Vintage players won't give up their power and tournaments like the SCG P9 style tournaments. What we need is a big push from Wizards. Come on! Give us the official notice. Make a Legacy PTQ or GP. Do something to help the competitive players have a competitive, tournament format!

Good stuff will be happening, Kevin. Stay tuned to magicthegathering.com to find out exactly what we have planned, but trust me when I say that we'll be supporting Legacy as a format.
