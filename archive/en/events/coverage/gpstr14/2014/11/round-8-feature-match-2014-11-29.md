In the penultimate round of the day, two national team captains clashed: Nico Bohny and Bing Han, fighting for Switzerland and China, respectively. Neither was a stranger to the feature match area: Bing had been a semifinalist at Grand Prix Shanghai last month, Bohny, among other things, had been a finalist in Milan earlier this year.


Both players had just one loss in the tournament so far, so neither was in danger of being eliminated from Day 2 contention just yet. However, both would need at least one more match win to secure a spot in the Booster Draft portion of the event.


Bohny had built an Abzan deck with a slight Warrior theme, Bing was simply playing the best of all five colors.


Game 1
======


Bohny led with [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) and [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin) but didn't get very far before Bing caught up to him with [Sultai Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Flayer) and [Highspire Mantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highspire+Mantis). Bohny's [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) was matched perfectly by Bing [Suspension Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suspension+Field).

Bing further cemented his stranglehold on the game with Archer's [Parapet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parapet) and [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer). In fact, Bohny was only able to mount another offense when he cast [Raiders' Spoils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raiders%27+Spoils), and even then he only managed to get in another 4 damage. And since Bing traded away [Sultai Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Flayer) in the process, even that was for naught.



[Highspire Mantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highspire+Mantis) and [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer) flew to victory with Archer's [Parapet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parapet) taking the final life.


**Bing Han 1-0 Nico Bohny**


Game 2
======


Again, Bohny deployed the first creatures, with [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin) and a morph, but lost both to [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning).


Both players had further morphs. However, while Bing encountered some difficulties and basically never found his fourth land, Bohny's deck was operating on full power and gave him [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter), [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way), [Herald of Anafenza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Anafenza), and [Armament Corps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armament+Corps).


Bing fought valiantly with [Kill Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Shot), but when he finally drew a fourth land to cast [Highspire Mantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highspire+Mantis), he promptly lost it to [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle), and subsequently lost the game as well.


**Bing Han 1-1 Nico Bohny**


Game 3
======


This was a quick and easy affair and easy to recount too. After a mulligan, Bohny only cast one [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter) during the first five turns of the game, followed by an Unyielding Kumar which immediately yielded to [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) and one [Woolly Loxodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Loxodon) which immediately met its [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom).

Meanwhile, Bing had summoned [Abzan Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Falconer) and one, two, three morphs, taught the Falconer to fly, and well ... Bohny soon conceded and revealed the [Rush of Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Battle) that had been one of two spells in his opening hand and not one of the three spells he had cast that game ...



**Nico Bohny 1-2 Bing Han**
