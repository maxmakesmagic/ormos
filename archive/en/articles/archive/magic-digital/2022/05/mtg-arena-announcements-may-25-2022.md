June 2 Updates and Improvements
===============================


Next week's update will introduce new looks and some improvements to player experience:


Packs
-----


Mythic Packs for all Standard-legal sets will be available in the Store under the Packs tab (located at the bottom of the Store scene). Plus, all packs will be purchasable with gems or gold!


Event Navigation
----------------


When browsing an event from the Play blade, you won't have to take the extra step of navigating to Home to get back to the events list in the Play blade—just click the back arrow and you're there!

Hotswapping Rebalanced Cards
----------------------------


Starting with the June 2 update, you won't have to manually swap rebalanced cards when using a deck in different formats; this will happen automatically.


For example, if you enter a Standard event with a deck that includes rebalanced Alchemy cards, those will be swapped to their Standard-legal versions for you, making the deck legal for that event. Note that this doesn't apply to digital-only cards with no corresponding Standard versions. Those cards will be marked as illegal in a Standard event.


The same swapping will happen when entering an Alchemy event with a Standard card that has a rebalanced Alchemy version.


Restyled Craft All and Delete Buttons
-------------------------------------


To help prevent accidents when selecting Craft All and Delete buttons, we've restyled and rearranged these.

Starter Deck Folder
-------------------


There will be two folders in the Decks scene beginning with the June 2 update: My Decks and Starter Decks.


![My Decks and Starter Decks folders](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/ma43f99vdmp.jpg)


The Starter Decks folder holds the decks you receive when you first start playing and for completing tasks like the Color Challenge. This folder will keep these starter decks separate from the decks you've created or modified (these are stored in the My Decks folder). The folder includes fifteen starter decks (multicolor decks will appear when they are earned during the Color Challenge). These can be played like any other deck in your collection.


Decks in the Starter Decks folder will *not* take up the 100 deck slots you have for your own decks. They will also appear in your My Decks folder where they can be deleted or modified; decks in the Starter Decks folder cannot be deleted or modified.


*Alchemy: New Capenna* Arrives June 2!
======================================


The 30-card *Alchemy: New Capenna* set hits *MTG Arena* June 2, and beyond extending the themes and flavor of *Streets of New Capenna* for both Alchemy and Historic players, this Alchemy set brings a few differences from previous Alchemy releases:


* The distribution of rarities in *Alchemy: New Capenna* has changed with more uncommons and fewer rares.
* Alchemy cards get a fresh look to make the "A" for Alchemy visually distinct from the *MTG Arena* "A" logo.
 ![New Alchemy logo on the front of an Alchemy pack](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/28bm62zwrew.jpg)
* There will be two Alchemy events that accompany the release!

Special Alchemy Events
----------------------


**Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy: June 2–6**


This special event, held through release weekend, gives players the opportunity to acquire Alchemy cards through drafting. Players draft three packs of *Streets of New Capenna*, but one common card in each pack is replaced with a card from *Alchemy: New Capenna*. This card can be any rarity, so some packs will have multiple rares!


Each draft pack contains one card from *Alchemy: New Capenna*.


* 55% of packs contain an uncommon card.
* 38.57% of packs contain a rare card.
* 6.43% of packs contain a mythic card.
* Each rare appears twice as often as each mythic.

Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy has the same entry and payouts as the familiar Premier Draft events and awards *Alchemy: New Capenna* packs. The usual Premier Draft New Capenna event will remain available throughout the weekend as well.


*Alchemy: New Capenna* packs will also now be awarded by Alchemy events, traditional Alchemy events, and the upcoming Alchemy Metagame Challenge for those who want to stick to Constructed play


**Into the Future: June 2–4**


Into the Future returns June 2–4 with preconstructed decks that spotlight new cards and their capabilities. This event has no entry fee, awards *Alchemy: New Capenna* packs, and earns you 1,000 Mastery XP for participating!


Into the Future will be available next Thursday and Friday, so try out the latest additions to *MTG Arena*!


Best-of-Three Play-In Event: May 27
===================================


The next [Play-In event](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in) is set for this Friday, May 27! This will be a Best-of-Three Phantom *Streets of New Capenna* Sealed competition with prizes—plus, rack up four wins and earn an invitation to the [May 28–29 Qualifier Weekend](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend)!


The Brokers *Streets of New Capenna* Family Festivals!
======================================================


The clock is ticking on the [Rise of the Five Families Festival](https://magic.wizards.com/mtga-snc-rise-of-the-families), and we're down to the last event running May 24–27 where the Brokers prove just how powerful the stroke of a pen can be!


The format is Alchemy Singleton with Best-of-One matches, and each player starts with an emblem with the text: "You may cast spells from the top of your library by removing a counter from a creature you control in addition to paying their other costs."


You can add these golden age card styles to your collection for playing:
