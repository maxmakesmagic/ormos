THE BATTLES FOR 9-0
===================



 Posted in [ARTICLES](/en/articles)
 on March 15, 2014 









Here's a quick look at three of the 8-0 matches. The fourth, Zac Hill vs Philip Dettelis, was decided on-camera. The fight to be one of the Day 1 Undefeateds is an odd mix of pressure and serenity. On the one hand, players fight their hardest, knowing that a 9-0 start means that a Top 8 berth is well within reach. On the other hand, even if you lose, you're still in Day 2 with a loss to give. The worst-case scenario isn't nearly so bad. Here's how things shook out.


 


**Daniel Fournier (Blue-Red) vs Jacob Gagnon (Green-Blue splashing Red)**


 


Gagnon took the first game on the back of a very monstrous [Polis Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polis+Crusher) with help from [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix) to make sure Fournier could not race. In the second, Fournier's [Deepwater Hypnotist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepwater+Hypnotist) got help from a bestowed [Everflame Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflame+Eidolon) and started taking huge chunks out of Gagnon's life total. He again had the [Polis Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polis+Crusher), but the race was not in his favor. Worse, he forgot that the Hypnotist had shrunk a 1/1 [Setessan Oathsworn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn)'s power, so that [Fall of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Hammer) was not the blowout he had anticipated.


They shuffled up for the decider. Fournier led with [Flitterstep Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flitterstep+Eidolon) and took out a [Setessan Oathsworn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn) with [Fall of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Hammer) before it could grow out of reach. Gagnon had no play on four mana, and Fournier added [Wavecrash Triton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton) to his board. Gagnon took to the skies with a 4/4 [Siren of the Fanged Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+of+the+Fanged+Coast). Fournier gave his Flitterstep a [Dragon Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) and hit for four, spending his last two mana on [Deepwater Hypnotist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepwater+Hypnotist). Gagnon was long on land and short on options. He played [Stratus Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) on the Siren to draw a card, and [Nyxborn Triton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Triton) to block.


Unfortunately for him, Fournier was going bigger. He tapped six for [Shipbreaker Kraken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipbreaker+Kraken). A [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm) kept it at bay for a turn, but Fournier hit eight land right on time to lock up Gagnon's board. An attack later and the match was his.


**Fournier wins 2-0**


 


**Joe Demestrio (Blue-White) vs Michael Ando (White-Black)**


 


In the first game, the two players traded creatures before Ando got way ahead thanks to a 5/5 [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch). Demestrio was flooding out and summoned [Horizon Scholar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar). Ando had [Asphyxiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate) at the ready, and without a way to stop the big opposing flier, Demestrio had to pack up.


Ando had a textbook aggressive draw for the second game. [Akroan Skyguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard) into [Elite Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Skirmisher), then [Spiteful Returned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiteful+Returned) to tap a blocker and get in for piles more damage. It didn't help that Demestrio was on all blue lands. He tried to barricade behind [Prescient Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prescient+Chimera) and [Horizon Scholar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar), but [Glimpse the Sun God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God) pushed through exactly lethal damage.


**Ando wins 2-0**


 


**Gerard Fabiano (Green-Red splashing Blue) vs Terrence Dufour (Blue-Red)**


 


Fabiano and Dufour were already shuffling up for their second game by the time I was tableside, Fabiano having taken the first. The second proceeded at an equallly blistering pace. Fabiano was first on the board and pressured Dufour with a sequence of early plays. Dufour's draw was short on early plays and his life total started to drop. He tried to regroup but Fabiano knocked him back with [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix), then played [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels). Even though he wasn't manifest, Xenagos's ability served up hasty attackers to defeat Dufour before his big creatures could come online.


**Fabiano wins 2-0**
