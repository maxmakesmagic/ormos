 It was a near miss for Brain Braun-Duin to advance to his semifinal match. In three close games, it took every trick in his deck's playbook to squeak out a victory against the powerful MUD deck. Now, in the semifinals, Braun-Duin faced another tricky opponent. While [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) were powerful tools, the maindeck choice of [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast)s and [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) would be anemic until sideboarding got involved.




 Braun-Duin's opponent? Royce Walter armed with [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) Tendrils. One of the classic storm-based decks of the format, Walter's plan was to sculpt a hand of fast mana – [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), Lion's Eye Diamond – and a tutor effect to ambush an opponent with a self-copying-for-lethal [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony). [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) let the storm player convert life into cards, and protecting the critical turn came on the back of cards like [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress).



Would Walter's battering storm sink the cruise Braun-Duin was sailing?



**The Games**




 In the first game Braun-Duin led off with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) to see the setup Walter's storm deck had kept. Noting the massaging it would need, Braun-Duin proceeded with [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) for [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) as uncontested plays over the next few turns. Walter just worked to set up his hand. The Louisville winner wasted no time attacking, beating as Walter dug into his deck for the cards he wanted.
