C*ostume.* Noun. A thingy we put on to take the identity of someone else. We don our polyurethane Halloween finery to enter Candy-Seeking Wolverine Mode or to spend the evening subsuming our own identity into that of Sexy Frankenstein. Or whatever. Your mileage may vary. But that's not the only meaning of "costume" I want to talk about today.

In a behind-the-scenes-of-**Magic**-flavor context—one of my favorite contexts, as contexts go—when we talk about "costume," we mean something more like what a movie studio means. Moviewise, costuming is part of the overall look of the film; it's one part of the production design. It's an element of the set dressing that happens to be stitched onto the actors. Costuming is what communicates the time, place, and detail of the setting in anthropological terms. Costuming is *worn culture*.

Costuming in **Magic** art is the same way. It communicates what's going on in the setting just as much as the way the [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s look this year or what phonemes go into the proper names. In fact, you can tell what's up with a world without even looking at anything but *la mode*. You want a glimpse of the soul of a setting without seeing the Planeswalker's Guide? Check out what people wear there.

The danger-filled, adventure-plane of Zendikar? Exploring gear. Weapons that serve as tools and don't take up a lot of pack space. Durable leather and dirtied, dented bits of plate.

The dragon-trawled, barbaric hellscape of Jund? Skimpy shreds of personally-hunted hide. Shamanic tattoos. Bone trophies.

The once-devastated, struggling-to-recover wasteland of Dominaria? Air-filtering facemasks. Sculptural, eye-protecting mage gear inspired by the husks of defeated Phyrexians.

We devote entire pages in our world guides to costuming. In addition to getting to play [Slartibartfast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slartibartfast) as we design a setting's coastlines and continents, we get to play [Ngila Dickson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngila_Dickson) or [Jean-Paul Gaultier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Paul_Gaultier) as we craft the worn culture of the plane. We get to think about grommets and coat buttons, collar folds and epaulets. Elbow-length gloves and knee-high boots. Prussian military-inspired armor and Hessian soldier-inspired jackets. Priests' robe-sleeves and vampire slayers' stake-holsters. Corset-reinforced peasant dresses and sleepwear-reminiscent gowns for angels. And hats. If we were going to a gothic horror setting then *BY HOLY AVACYN ON HIGH**THERE WOULD BE HAAAATS*.
