What Is the *Magic Online* Bug Blog?


While the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) is simply that—a running list of issues we expect players to encounter most often—this accompanying “Bug Blog” is the list’s companion. Here you’ll find updates regarding emergent new issues, details around issue statuses when applicable, known issue workarounds, and a running tally of Known Issues List updates. The Bug Blog will be updated each Thursday, in conjunction with the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) on the same day.

**Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues**



We're hard at work on whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.

**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly |
| General | Players can experience memory leaks in some situations | Restarting the client can temporarily resolve these issues |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues |

**Server**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem |
