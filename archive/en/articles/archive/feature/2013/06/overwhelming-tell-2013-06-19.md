![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1258_judge.jpg)Back in April I unveiled two new promos for our judge program. [That time](/en/node/648691) it was [Crucible of Worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds) and [Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery). This time I'm back with two new judge promos!


Before I dive into the promos, though, let me talk to you about the judging community and how it is a crucial part of the community. They help to oversee and facilitate a fun and fair competitive **Magic** scene around the world!


If you're interested in learning about becoming a judge here are a few useful links for you:


* [Official Judge Resource](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=judge/welcome) - Start here and read about the program.
* [How to Become a Certified Judge](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=judge/becoming/how) - A great introduction about how to become a certified judge.
* [List of Regional Coordinators](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=judge/resources/coords) - As the judge community has grown, so has the infrastructure. Not sure who to contact? Reach out to your nearest regional coordinator and he or she will be able to help.
* [Become a Judge](http://wiki.magicjudges.org/en/w/Become_a_judge) - The judge community also maintains an [unofficial wiki](http://wiki.magicjudges.org/en/w/Main_Page) as a reference tool, and it has a number of useful articles. This is just one of them.

To be clear, not every judge receives the promos I show here; just as not every player receives the other promos we show on the site. But to start down the path of earning these sweet promos, you need to get into the judging program and you'll learn more from there!


We've got new art for [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell), and a first-time foil for [Overwhelming Forces](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Forces)!
