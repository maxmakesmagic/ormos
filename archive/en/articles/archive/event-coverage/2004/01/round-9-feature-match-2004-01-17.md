He's come very close to making the Top 8 of a Pro Tour on numerous occasions, and came in ninth on tiebreakers at Japanese Nationals last summer. He's in position to make a run at that elusive Top 8 once again, coming into this round with a 6-2 record. Japanese players have made the Top 8 of the last four individual Pro Tours, but it would be nice to see one of the old guard get his due. Remie made Top 8 of Worlds in Berlin back in August, and so far has a 5-2-1 record in his native country's Pro Tour. ### Game 1

Fujita played [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow), slipped with his hand, and accidentally revealed [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam). This got a huge laugh out of both players, as Remie slowly named the card as he wrote a reminder on his scorepad. Fujita played a Den-Guard and [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr), while Remie had [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion). The Longbow went on the Den-Guard, letting it get through for two damage. Remie played another Hill Giant in [Goblin War Wagon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon), and ended his turn. [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) dealt with that threat, and Fujita made his side a little more threatening with [Golem-Skin Gauntlets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golem-Skin+Gauntlets). Consume Strength killed the [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr), and Fujita took his turn, attacking with the Den-Guard and summoning [Fatespinner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner). Remie played yet another War Wagon, and Fujita played [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher). With Remie already at nine due to early attacks and the Longbow, along with [Fatespinner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner) slowing things down, the Charbelcher was quite threatening. A few turns later, Remie conceded.

Remie- 0 Fujita- 1

### Game 2

Fujita opened with [Leonin Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder), and once again, a card slipped out of his hand- [Pearl Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Shard). Fujita almost fell out of his chair laughing.

Fujita played [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr), and used [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) on the next turn to deal with [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher). Remie's Wagon was matched by Fujita's Myr and [Auriok Steelshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Steelshaper), and thanks to the cost of moving the Longbow being reduced, Fujita looked to move it around his creatures to deal three to the Wagon. Instead, Remie cast [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam) in response to stall that plan for a bit. The Wagon attacked for three more damage, and was followed by [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin). This was nullified by [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest), and Fujita played his second Steelshaper, which combined with the Longbow let him pay one mana and tap any creature to deal a point of damage. [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer) turned things from ugly to massacre, and Remie conceded.

Remie- 0 Fujita- 2
