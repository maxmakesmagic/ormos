Each week, we'll be offering a free desktop wallpaper using some cool Magic card art. Any card past or present is fair game, and we don't care how playable the card is, just that it has a great illustration.


This week's offering is the *Odyssey* Vampire [Stalking Bloodsucker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Bloodsucker) by Greg Staples.
