The Top 4 Playoff will be Standard Constructed.


#### World Championship Tournament Length & Advancement


**World Championship**


* 14 Swiss Rounds total, 60 minutes per round.
* When time is called, the active player will finish the turn and five additional turns will be taken.
* Stalling and slow play rules will be strictly enforced during the tournament.
* All players may participate in all 14 Swiss rounds on Friday and Saturday’s competition.
* The Top 4 players after Round 14 will advance to Sunday’s single-elimination playoff rounds.

#### World Championship Playoff


* Playoff matches will be best 3 out of 5.
* The first two games played in a 3 out of 5 playoff match on Sunday are pre-sideboard games. After Game 2 is completed, players may exchange cards from their deck for cards in their sideboard.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the semifinal playoff round.
* While there are no time limits in the playoff rounds, players are expected to play at a reasonable pace and finish their matches within 90 minutes.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

#### Team Series Championship


The Team Series Championship will consist of *Guilds of Ravnica*Team Sealed, in which both teams split into two groups of three.


Teams will construct 40-card decks on Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m. on September 23, with each group within their team receiving twelve booster packs from which to construct a total of three decks per group. The two groups may help each other during deck construction. Deck construction will last for 90 minutes.


Match play with the Team Sealed decks will take place at roughly 10:15 a.m. local time. The groups in each team will be paired against one another randomly, and the two groups that face off will play one at a time.


All matches for the Team Series Championship are best two-out-of-three. When two team members in a single group have won two games, their group is declared the winner of the entire match.


If, at the end of two team matches, one team has won both, that team will be declared the Team Series Championship. If both teams are tied at the end of two matches, the winning group from each team will face off to determine a winner.


#### Notes


* Planeswalker Points Multiplier 12x (Lifetime Total only), REL: Professional.
* Players are required to use the same Standard Constructed decks turned in to tournament staff for all days of competition.
