By now you've probably heard about a little thing called the Community Cup, which begins this Friday, August 30, and runs through Saturday, August 31. Select members of the **Magic Online** community will square off against the Wizards of the Coast team in an epic **Magic** showdown.
The [Community Team](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/community-cup-2013-team-and-formats-2013-08-07) and the [Wizards Team](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/wizards-team-announcement-2013-08-20) have both been assembled. You can catch the action live:


Tune in on [Twitch.tv/magic](/en/events/coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93amsterdam-standard-qualifier-season-top-8-decklists):

* Friday, August 30, at 11:00 AM PDT, and
* Saturday, August 31, at 10:30 AM PDT

But this is the *Community* Cup--shouldn't the entire community have a stake in their fate?


Indeed you do! This year you can help the Community defeat Wizards by participating in the **Community Challenge**. On Friday, August 30, at 12:00 PM PDT, every match you win against a Wizards of the Coast participant will add one point to the Community Team's total score.


But be careful! When a Wizards participant defeats you, Wizards will add one point to their total score! These points will be added to the respective Community Cup team's scores to determine the winner of the Community Cup.


Here's the best part: If the community team defeats Wizards in the Community Cup, all community participants who played against a Wizards participant during the Community Cup event will receive the a Rakdos Cackler promo card, as well as a premium foil Sliver Queen card.

If the community loses, however, participants will enjoy a parting gift that will remind them of their stinging defeat each time they look through their **Magic Online** collections:

--------------------------------


We bring back the **Magic Online** Cube regularly, and when we do, we pair it with another draft format. Before the release of ***Magic** 2014*, we paired the **Magic Online** Cube with *Rise of the Eldrazi* draft format.  

 
This time, we're going to let you pick the paired format! What's your favorite? Go [vote in the poll](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1303&date=08/21/2013) at the bottom of Trick Jarrett's article and let us know!
