For many players this weekend, Orlando is a short drive away. Or at least a short flight. Not so for our two players battling it out here in round four. Belgium's Marijn Lybaert is combining the Grand Prix with vacation time with his wife Kelly. Lybaert divides his *Magic* time between playing in as many Grand Prix as possible, and being part of the European Event Coverage video team, where he uses his expertise to share his love of the game, a love that has taken him to four Pro Tour Top 8s. For the Czech Republic's Stanislav Cifka, Orlando is a natural precursor to the Pro Tour in Honolulu next week. Already a Pro Tour Champion from Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* in 2012 in Seattle, Cifka has established a reputation as one of the most formidable Pros on the circuit, and a player with a fearsome work ethic when it comes to deckbuilding.
