The October 26, 2017 Update

 Katie is a copy editor and occasional writer for DailyMTG, as well as a longtime Magic player with a fondness for giant green creatures. She especially loves Commander, despite having the patience of a fruit fly, and might glare at you if your turn takes too long. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 26, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Grand Prix Phoenix](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gppho17), [Grand Prix Liverpool](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpliv17), and [Grand Prix Hong Kong](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gphk17)—all of which are happening this very weekend!


Today's Must
============


1. [Threat Assessment Case Studies](https://collected.company/2017/10/25/threat-assessment-case-studies/) | Collected.Company | The Command Zone

Threat assessment is always an important part of *Magic*, but in Commander, with multiple opponents and ever-shifting feuds and alliances, it's both more important and more complex. Is the biggest creature the biggest threat? The planeswalker that's closest to ultimating? Or is it the player with the highest life total? The one doing the most attacking, or the most interacting? There are many possibilities, and your priorities can change completely from one turn to the next. The Command Zone crew walks through several possible gameplay situations to explore this debate (and by the way, one such situation involves Cassius Marsh casting a turn-three [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon)).


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [At the Multiverse – *Ixalan* Story Critique – A *Magic: The Gathering* Lore Review Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGO7q0N_qyk) | YouTube | Tolarian Community College

<https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGO7q0N_qyk>


The Professor and Michelle, Librarian of the Loregyofs, dive deep into the *Ixalan* story arc to give it some Serious Literary Criticism. Topics include Jace's giggling, armor made of belts, Huatli's employment woes, and Nicol Bolas's personal spa. It's all very educational.


1. [What's the Un-Pick?](https://blogging-phelddagrif.tumblr.com/post/166781974560/whats-the-un-pick-seeing-as-unstable-is-coming) | Tumblr | blogging-phelddagrif

No, it's not a blog post about what card to never, ever pick. Tumblr user blogging-phelddagrif has crafted an *Un*- cube, and in celebration of *Unstable*'s upcoming release, they're playing "what's the pick?" with some fabulously silly options.


1. [To Ur Is Human](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/10/to-ur-is-human-ur-dragon-mtg-edh-commander/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Ryan Sainio

Giving the gift of *Magic* is always a pretty cool thing to do (psst, Mom, write that down), but Ryan took it to a new level in putting together the perfect wedding present for his friend. Said friend, Jesse, is a serious Dragon enthusiast. So Ryan got him the new preconstructed [The Ur-Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Ur-Dragon) *Commander (2017 Edition)* deck—but he didn't stop there. He customized the deck, powered it up, and even managed to smuggle in some of Jesse's own beloved Dragon cards. It's a pretty sweet story, and also holy crap how did I forget about [Bower Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bower+Passage)?


1. [Grand Prix Hong Kong Primer](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/lee-shi-tian/grand-prix-hong-kong-primer) | MTG Mint Card | Lee Shi Tian

GP Hong Kong starts tomorrow! *Magic* excitement aside, if you're traveling to the event—as a participant or a player—you could probably use some advice from a helpful local. Lee Shi Tian, as it happens, is both local and helpful, and he's provided some excellent tips on travel, food, and entertainment.


1. [Milling About](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/carlosgutierrez-10262017-milling-about/) | GatheringMagic | Carlos Gutierrez

According to Carlos, mill is having a moment in Modern right now, and from the look of this deck, I can see why. I'm pretty sure I've heard of at least a *few* cards heavily played in Modern that search libraries, so the simple combination of [Archive Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archive+Trap) with [Fraying Sanity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fraying+Sanity) looks terrifying. Combined with strategically deployed [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate)s and/or [Surgical Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction)s to remove vital combo pieces, this powerhouse mill engine looks ready to take down almost anything.


1. [My (Better) Eternal Weekend](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/my-better-eternal-weekend/) | ChannelFireball | Ondřej Stráský

I find Eternal formats pretty intimidating, so it's actually a relief to know that even top players like Ondřej Stráský feel that way sometimes, too. After a much better finish than he anticipated at Eternal Weekend, Ondřej shares some of the lessons he learned along the way, as well as some helpful tips about the Legacy format as a whole. (Shout-out to [Nimble Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose)!)

As we [announced yesterday](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-closed-beta-incoming-2017-10-25), the *Magic: The Gathering Arena* Closed Beta will be kicking off in about a month.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Stenberg1's Black-Red Aggro](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-10-25)

This 5-0 list from *Magic Online* player Stenberg1 has some obvious similarities to the ubiquitous Ramunap Red, but there are also some distinct and intriguing differences (beyond, you know, the whole second color).


For one, the combination of [Night Market Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Market+Lookout) and [Aethersphere Harvester](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersphere+Harvester) seems like a great way to keep your life total stable even as you go all-in on your aggressive plan. [Vance's Blasting Cannons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vance%27s+Blasting+Cannons) in the sideboard is another interesting inclusion, and a great way to stay heckbent (having one or fewer cards in hand) for [Dread Wanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer) without running out of resources. Overall, the deck looks like a great combination of proactive and reactive, and I'll be interested to see if this is the beginning of a black-red resurgence.
