**Game 1**


Cook led with [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) for [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea) into [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Durward sacrificed [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) to destroy the [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea). Durward played a turn-two [Gemstone Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine) and his second [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Durward followed with [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) on his second turn. Turn-three for Cook consisted of [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), bringing the Gemstone Cavern down to one counter, followed by [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) to shuffle away the unwanted cards. Durward's third turn was a less impressive hard-cast [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). Cook took this opportunity to Burning wish for Dimishing Returns. Durward attacked Cook with [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) which in combination with fetch-land activations and exalted brought Cook to fourteen. Durward finished his turn with resolving [Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest).

Cook started turn-five with [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Rite of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame). This was when Cook started noting his storm count. Dark ritual, [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) and [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) raised the count to five. Cook responded to his [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) by sacrificing [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) for black mana. The tutor searched up [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam). Cook played Ad Nausem and revealed [Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence), [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) , [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor), [Gemstone Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine), [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor), [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens), and [Orim's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) before stopping to think. After a short pause, Cook revealed one more card; [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal). Cook then played a land, [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), and finally [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) for eighteen Goblins. Facing down a Goblin horde, Durward took to the air by discarding [Vengevine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) to [Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) for [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) then pitching [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) for [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). Cook played [Orim's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) with kicker during combat to preserve his precious two life points.

*Bryant Cook* |

Cook attacked with eighteen Goblins. Durward traded his [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) for a Goblin and was dealt seventeen damage going down to three. Durward was finally able to show what his Survival engine can do when he pitched [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), with madness, to get another [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). The second [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) was then discarded, with madnees, to trigger the [Vengevine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine)s in Durwards graveyard. Cook had no answer for the flying duo of Elementals.

**Game 2**


Cook led with [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) into [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Durward mimicked his game-one performance with an immediate [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) activation on his turn. On the next turn, Cook played [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta). Durward continued his parody of game-one with [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) on turn-two. A [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) activation, and a [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) summed up Cook's following turn. Durward applied major pressure by casting [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), discarding [Vengevine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine), and casting [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). This triggered [Vengevine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) and allowed Durward to attack Cook down to thirteen. Cook knew he was running out of time so we went for broke. He played [Rite of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame)s, two [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), two [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), and a [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) for Dimishing Returns. Durward attempted to [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) the Returns, but [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) ensured a fresh hand of seven cards for both players. Cook's new hand yielded him two [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) but managed nothing more from casting those spells. Cook extended his hand and Durward continued on to the Semi-Finals.
