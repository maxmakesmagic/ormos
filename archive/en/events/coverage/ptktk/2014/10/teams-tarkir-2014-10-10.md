The “team beach house” has become a well-known staple of Pro Tours in recent years, and as you might expect Honolulu was no different. Dozens of competitors made the trip to Hawaii a week early to spend a few days prepping for the tournament (and enjoying the beach), and each team came to its own conclusions about the format and how to best approach it.


Working with a team offers a player many advantages. Aside from having draft partners and friends to go to dinner with, players also get to partner with some of the best minds in the world to decide how to attack the format. That has made team affiliation crucial in recent years, especially in a wide-open format like this one.


So what teams will rise to the top this weekend? Here’s a quick list of the major teams competing in Honolulu.
