Modern was the last format played during the Swiss rounds by 24 players in the 2016 *Magic* World Championship.


Last weekend, Grand Prix events in [Indianapolis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpind16), [Lille](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplil16), and [Guangzhou](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpgua16) set the stage. There, Affinity, Jund, and Bant Eldrazi put up the best [numbers](https://twitter.com/karsten_frank/status/770160357289631744).


That was last weekend. This week, we have the most prestigious tournament of the year—the 2016 *Magic* World Championship—and the metagame couldn't be more different. All Modern decklists can be found [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016wc/modern-decklists-2016-09-03), and they are as follows:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Archetype** | **Number of Players** | **Combined Record** |
| Abzan | 8 | 14-17-1 (45%) |
| Jund | 2 | 6-2 (75%) |
| Bant Eldrazi | 2 | 5-2-1 (71%) |
| Living End | 2 | 2-6 (25%) |
| TitanShift | 2 | 7-1 (88%) |
| Scapeshift | 1 | 2-2 (50%) |
| Affinity | 1 | 1-3 (25%) |

| Goryo's Vengeance | 1 | 2-2 (50%) |
| Thing Ascension | 1 | 1-3 (25%) |

Abzan and Jund
==============


The big story is the sea of Abzan decks. It was the deck registered by No. 2-ranked Seth Manfield, No. 4-ranked Luis Scott-Vargas, No. 11-ranked Andrea Mengucci, No. 13-ranked Mike Sigrist, No. 13-ranked Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, Sam Pardee, Márcio Carvalho, and Thiago Saporito, making up one-third of the metagame.


On top of that, No. 6-ranked Reid Duke and No. 18-ranked Brad Nelson took their trusty Jund decks to battle, essentially falling back on the decks they knew inside out when they didn't feel comfortable with anything else. "Reid and I can't fight who we are," Brad Nelson told me in typically jovial fashion.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tarmogoyf)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)
I have heard one World Championship competitor describe these [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek)/[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) decks as "comfort food." They are fair, interactive, decision-heavy, and have game against everything—exactly the style of deck that the best players in the world are comfortable with.


Another factor that influenced these players' deck choices was their metagame expectation. Reid Duke and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, for instance, told me that they expected several people to play unfair creature decks, such as Affinity, Infect, Burn, and [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Zoo—all good matchups for Abzan. They weren't expecting many bad matchups like [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) or Tron.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Collective+Brutality)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grim+Flayer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer)
Several new cards from *Eldritch Moon* have been slipping their way into the decks. [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) is brutal versus burn; [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope) can kill off [Glistener Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), or [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) tokens; and [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer) is one of the reasons many players favor Abzan over Jund, as hitting [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) with that card feels so good.


Besides that, white offers better sideboard hate cards such as [Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence), and [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) is better than [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) against [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) and [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). So even though Jund was by far the most popular deck at Grand Prix Guangzhou and Grand Prix Lille, the majority of the World Championship competitors spoke out in favor of Abzan.


There were still plenty of small differences across the lists, though. The testing group of Damo da Rosa, Scott-Vargas, Pardee, and Sigrist registered a list with 3 [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch)s. "It's surprisingly relevant with [Shambling Vent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Vent) and sometimes helps push [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer) through. In practice it over-performs," Damo Da Rosa told me. "[Traverse the Ulvenwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traverse+the+Ulvenwald), the card I played at Grand Prix Indianapolis instead of [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), was really bad." The quartet also put an [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) in the main deck because they felt they were a bit creature-light, and they wanted to shave some graveyard hate from the sideboard.


Seth Manfield's version also had [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), but with more three-drops instead of [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) or [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer). "I just played [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) to accelerate my game plan." With the option to ramp into a turn-two [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope) or [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), he could have pretty strong starts.


Finally, Andrea Mengucci brought his own version without [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer), and Márcio Carvalho and Thiago Saporito basically copied Willy Edel's list. When in doubt, trust the Abzan master when he tells you he has a good list.


Living End
==========


At last year's World Championship, No. 9-ranked Joel Larsson and No. 7-ranked Martin Müller showed up with [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End). This year, despite playing [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Zoo at the Modern Pro Tour, the Scandinavian duo stuck with their [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) deck for the World Championship metagame.


Their game plan is to cycle creatures on the first two turns and then cascade into [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) with [Violent Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Outburst) or [Demonic Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Dread), clearing the board and creating an army of [Street Wraith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith), [Architects of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Architects+of+Will), [Deadshot Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadshot+Minotaur), and/or [Monstrous Carabid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monstrous+Carabid).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Living+End)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Violent+Outburst)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Outburst)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Demonic+Dread)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Dread)
As they explained, Larsson and Müller felt that proactive aggro decks like Affinity, Burn, Infect, and Suicide Zoo were level 1, but they expected that not many people would play them. Instead, they expected that everyone would be trying to beat those decks with a reactive level 2 deck, most notably Abzan or Jund. With that metagame expectation in mind, they went to level 3: a deck that might be poor against the proactive aggro decks, but that would be good against level 2.


"[Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) is really good versus Bant Eldrazi and favored versus Abzan," Müller said about his choice. Although the metagame worked out in their favor, their games did not, as the pair went a combined 2-6 in Modern.


Bant Eldrazi
============


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thought-Knot+Seer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reality+Smasher)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)
Bant Eldrazi is the best remaining home for [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) and [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) after the banning of [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin). Grand Prix Master Brian Braun-Duin and No. 5-ranked Steve Rubin are both playing the deck, hoping to ramp into a turn-two [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) via [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple). [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings) adds consistency, and [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) yields a mana sink for the late game.


"It's just one of the best decks, and it fits my style," Rubin said. "It's favored against all of the fair decks, and the good draws beat everybody. I was scared that people would be prepared with [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) and [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), so I have [Natural State](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+State) and [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) in my sideboard as a hedge."


Speaking of peculiar choices, Rubin has a sweet singleton [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) in his list. "It's extremely powerful because you play 4 [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer)s, and in the late game you win if you assemble [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) plus [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer). [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) is like my fifth [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope)."


Braun-Duin also had some spicy inclusions in his list. He started testing with 1 [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), but quickly added the second copy after discovering how powerful it was in the grindy games against Abzan. Against combo, he has [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) instead of [Stubborn Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stubborn+Denial), opting to spend mana on turn two rather than being forced to keep open mana in the late game.


TitanShift
==========


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Primeval+Titan)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scapeshift)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)
No. 18-ranked Oliver Tiu and No. 12-ranked Ondřej Stráský prepared together and found TitanShift to be the best deck. With a combined 7-1 record, their deck choice worked out very well.


Their list is different from the [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) versions that put two people in the Top 8 of GP Indianapolis last weekend. Tiu and Stráský don't even run [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach), instead ramping harder with [Khalni Heart Expedition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition). "[Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) is too high variance. It's more explosive, but less consistent," Tiu explained.


"We chose the deck because it has a good sideboard versus Affinity and because it's good versus Abzan," Tiu said when asked about his deck choice. "Abzan doesn't have enough pressure, and your late game is much stronger. Even if [your opponent] [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)s your threats, you can topdeck for the win or just kill with [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) naturally. Bad matchups were [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Zoo and Infect, but we thought those wouldn't be popular," echoing further how important leveling the expected metagame was to these competitors.


[Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)
=================================================================================


No. 3-ranked Lukas Blohon also ran a [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) deck, albeit a more controlling, blue-heavy list with four copies of [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and four copies of [Bring to Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bring+to+Light). This setup gives him plenty of silver bullets, such as [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) in the main deck or [Slaughter Games](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Games) in the sideboard.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cryptic+Command)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bring+to+Light)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bring+to+Light)
His reasoning for choosing the deck echoed Tiu's assessment. "I wanted something that was good against Jund and Abzan, and I was having decent results with [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). I didn't want to play Abzan mirrors all day long against players who are better than me. Fast decks like Infect, [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Zoo, and Affinity are not great matchups, but they are still beatable."


Blohon's list was fairly typical for a [Bring to Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bring+to+Light) version. The only choice that stood out to me was [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) over [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm). "[Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) is great against [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Zoo, gives time, and cycles through your deck."


Affinity and Infect
===================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Inkmoth+Nexus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus)
Only two players registered proactive aggro decks. No. 1-ranked Owen Turtenwald chose Infect because he wanted to just play a deck he knew well. *Magic Online* Champion Niels Noorlander tried a bunch of decks in preparation for the event, but in the end he chose the deck that he felt the best about: Affinity. Both players' lists were typical, unsurprising, but solid all around, and turn-three kills with [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) wouldn't be out of the question.


No one showed up with Burn or [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Zoo. Also, no Red-Green Tron, no Jeskai, no Ad Nauseam, no Elves, and no Merfolk. So it was definitely a different metagame than the one that was set by the three Grand Prix tournaments last weekend. Players on level 3 ([Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End), [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)) were happy to hear this, whereas players on level 2 were disappointed that they had few decks to prey upon. Such are the metagame guesses.


Abzan Company
=============


No. 8-ranked Shota Yasooka chose Abzan Company, aiming to piece together [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast), and [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) for a googolplex life and infinite scry, leaving him with a [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) on top for unlimited amounts of damage.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Viscera+Seer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kitchen+Finks)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks)
His sideboard featured a new addition in 2 [Distended Mindbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distended+Mindbender)s, which could lead to a devastating sequence of turn-one [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), turn-two [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), turn-three Mindbender that would cripple any opposing combo deck. His main deck also had a peculiar inclusion: 2 [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost)s, which would work well as graveyard hate against two of his compatriots.


Dredge
======


One player was brave enough to select [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) for the Modern rounds: Kazuyuki Takimura. His deck aims to sacrifice [Insolent Neonate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insolent+Neonate) on turn one, discarding [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) and milling over [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam), [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), and [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) to assemble a fast clock. Thanks to [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflagrate), securing the last points of damage would be easy as well.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prized+Amalgam)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Narcomoeba)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodghast)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)
While the deck is powerful, it is susceptible to graveyard hate. Several players had [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) in their main deck, and [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) and [Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) were featured prominently in sideboards. But Takimura was not afraid: "It's my favorite deck! No fear!" he said with a smile that made obvious how much he enjoyed the game.


Goryo's Vengeance
=================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Griselbrand)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)] [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance)
No. 22-ranked Yuuya Watanabe registred a Grixis deck that aimed to sneak [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) or [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) on the battlefield via [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) or [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance). His list was pretty much the same as Kentaro Yamamoto's Top 8 list from Grand Prix Guangzhou, who had shared his build and experience with Watanabe before the event.


A key addition from *Eldritch Moon* was [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality)—an interactive card that offered another discard outlet for [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance) next to [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) and [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm). Besides that, the sideboard was just as sweet, featuring two copies of [Quicksilver Amulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Amulet) and four copies of [Leyline of Sanctity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity) to improve against discard spells and graveyard hate. As Watanabe explained to me, "Against Abzan, if I play turn-one [Leyline of Sanctity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity) and turn-four Amulet, it's an easy win."


White-Black Tokens
==================


Jiachen Tao had one of the most unexpected deck choices going into the event. "I was hoping for more Affinity and Infect, but Abzan is a great matchup as well, depending on how much they are prepared against tokens."

Unusually, Tao's list has [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) main deck instead of [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). "I'm more comfortable playing a more disruptive game plan over something more aggressive. [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) on turn 3 is actually not that impressive in Modern." Another surprise was 4 [Asylum Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asylum+Visitor) in the sideboard: "It's better than [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) in grindy matchups. It has 3 power, you don't lose life from your expensive spells, and it also draws on the opponent's upkeep. It's great when I have [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) going."


Thing Ascension
===============

The final deck choice from our group of 24, and one that wouldn't be out of place at the Inventor's Fair on the plane of Kaladesh, was Ryoichi Tamada's Thing Ascension deck. Just last weekend, he made Top 8 at Grand Prix Guangzhou, and he only changed one card in the sideboard before the World Championship. He credits Okada Naoya as the inventor of the deck.


Essentially, it's a bunch of cheap spells, with 4 [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension)s and 4 [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice)s to exploit them. "[Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) is very strong in the deck!" he told me. As for the Abzan matchup, he claimed that it would largely come down to the amount of [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay)s that could destroy his key two-drops at instant speed. "Abzan with 4 [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay)s is difficult to beat, but Abzan with 2 [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay)s is good for me."
