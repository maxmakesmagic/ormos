Team MTG Mint Card Pro Huang Hao-Shan is a three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor and not unfamiliar to competing on the Australian Grand Prix Circuit. As a matter of fact, the last time he has seen success on this continent was during Grand Prix Brisbane 2011. Today, he has braved the twelve-hour flight once again and is armed with what he feels is the best Standard deck at the moment, Red Green Monsters.

*Huang Hao-Shan* 
"[Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) is my favorite addition from *Born of the Gods*. It is the glue that makes the deck gel together." According to him, it is rare that the Gruul gets card advantage machines like [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade), [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and Chandra Pyromaster, so he "cannot resist the temptation of playing the red green deck with card drawing".

The problem with Red Green decks in the past is that they run out of steam quickly and have difficulty coming back once they are behind. Flood is also a real concern and nobody likes to topdeck mana dorks or excess lands later on. However, these problems seem to have been mitigated by the existence of [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater), [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and [Mistcutter Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra), mana sinks that allow the Gruul player to dominate during the late game.


"I'm also overwhelmed by the size of Grand Prix Melbourne this time round. The community has ballooned tremendously and it is a sign that the game is flourishing and I'm very happy to be part of it. I'm also absolutely enjoying the weather here. Having dinner with friends in the warm sun while enjoying the cool sea breeze at St. Kilda's Beach is quite simply one of the greatest pleasures in life."


With his eyes set on a Top 4 finish that would grant him a blue envelope to Pro Tour Journey to Nyx, let's see where the power of Xenagos leads him.
