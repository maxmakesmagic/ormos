Coming in September, the first expansion for ***Magic** 2014—Duels of the Planeswalkers*! It will begin rolling out across platforms on September 18, 2013, and will become available depending on platform and region after that.


Let your spark grow into a raging wildfire! Explore new planes and fight new enemies with the ***Magic** 2014—Duels of the Planeswalkers* expansion, featuring additional campaign levels, decks, and challenges.
