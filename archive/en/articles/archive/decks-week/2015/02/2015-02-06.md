Last weekend saw two Grand Prix in North America: [Mexico City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmex15) and [San Jose](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsj15). The California event featured Team Limited and saw Paul Rietzl, Matt Sperling, and David Williams fighting to repeat their Grand Prix San Jose Team Limited victory. It was not to be, though, as they fell in the finals to Luis Scott-Vargas, Paul Cheon, and Eric Froehlich, who dubbed themselves "the Pork Bun Oath." In Mexico, GP Top 8 regular Pascal Maynard fought his way to victory in an exciting finals match that gathered quite the crowd. Congratulations to Luis, Paul (Paul Paul Paul), Eric, and Pascal!
