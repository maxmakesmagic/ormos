Jason opened with a turn two Myr followed by [Arcbound Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger) and [Aether Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb), while Levy started with Leonin Scymitar and [Myr Retriever](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Retriever). Stinger started swinging with Vulshok Morningstar and Levy promptly caught up on the damage race with [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker).

Spiteri used [Turn to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Dust) and [Battlegrowth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrowth) to finish up the Berserker and dropped a second Morningstar on his Stinger. Levy's Retriever looked rather small compared with the opposing flyer so the French dropped [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator) to keep it under control.

With his monster out of the Red Zone Jason was forced to play another attacker. He chose [Pewter Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem). Again Levy leaned forward in his chair and muttered. He stared at his cards for a few minutes rebuilding his plan.

Finally he decided he might as well play another Berserker and send it in. Jason fell to eight. Then Raphael gave his Retriever a [Leonin Bola](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola) to keep both of Spiteri's monsters at bay.

Again the player from Malta had to move. This time he played, and equipped, [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). Still on his next swing he could only sneak in a point of damage. Carefully Levy assembled his army, passing the Bola around to keep things under control.

With his attack plans still foiled Spiteri played a second [Pewter Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) but Raphael Levy had a plan... on his turn he used the Icy and Bola to tap all the blockers, sacrificed his Retriever to Krak-Clan Grunt to get back [Fireshrieker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireshrieker) and equipped the Grunt with it to deal the last eight points of damage.

Raphael 1 - Jason 0.

### Game 2

Levy's start wasn't impressive, using [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) to play [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) and then [Copper Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr) but Spiteri wasn't stellar either: the best he could do was a turn four [Cobalt Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem) and turn Five [Scavenging Scarab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Scarab).

The French got his [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator) on the table before dropping [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) and Krak-Clan Stoker. He started working the Red Zone, sending his creatures in. Spiteri used a [Battlegrowth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrowth) to trade [Arcbound Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger) for [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) but he was clearly in trouble, with a creature that can't block and a Golem getting tapped by Icy as his only creatures.

[Betrayal of Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) with Entwine brought back the Stinger and killed the [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog). Levy took the time to found out how his friend's round had worked out and then upped the ante. He replaced the dead [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) with... [Megatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megatog).

Jason tapped out to play [Flayed Nim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayed+Nim) but it wasn't enough. Raphael Levy used Icy to tap the only blocker. [Megatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megatog) went in to finish the game, after eating up all the yummy artifacts.

Final result: Raphael 2 - Jason 0.
