Time for a *Strixhaven* Pop Quiz
================================


You've been hitting the books since Strixhaven opened its doors, right? Learning the cards and mastering your spells? Congratulations, it's time for a pop quiz—the Arena Open is back!


May 8–9, we're revisiting the popular Sealed format from February, but this time with the new *Strixhaven: School of Mages* release. Battle *Strixhaven* Sealed and flex your on-the-fly deck-building muscles.


But before we get into the details:


* You must be 18 years or older to participate.
* Regional eligibility restrictions apply, void where prohibited.
* Receiving monetary rewards requires having or creating Wizards, DCI, and i-Payout accounts. *(i-Payout accounts cannot be created in advance.)*
* Refer to [the official Terms and Conditions](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arena-open-terms-and-conditions-2020-05-19) for complete details.

Chart Your Day 1 Course
=======================


You have three paths to choose from as you battle your way through Day 1.


**Play Best-of-One matches**: The format is *Strixhaven* Sealed, and seven wins earns you a qualification token for entry to Day 2 competition. Everyone who participates will receive the Rowan card sleeve!

**Play Best-of-Three matches**: The format is *Strixhaven* Traditional Sealed, and four wins earns you a qualification token for entry to Day 2 competition. Everyone who participates will receive the Will card sleeve!

**Play both**: This is for the overachievers and the collectors among you. Want to claim both the Rowan *and* the Will card sleeves? Play in both the Best-of-One and Best-of-Three matches. You may enter Day 1 events as many times as you'd like.


Note: earning multiple Day 2 qualification tokens still only counts as one entry to Day 2.


Face Your Day 2 Challenge for the Win
=====================================


You conquered the competition on Day 1, and now you've made it to Day 2. Top finishers in Day 2 earn monetary rewards! The Day 2 event will be Traditional *Strixhaven* Sealed with Best-of-Three matches using sideboards.


Here are all the crunchy details for both days. Get ready and good luck May 8–9!
