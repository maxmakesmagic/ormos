The April 25, 2017 Update
=========================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**
 on April 25, 2017

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 25, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by an extra-large Daily Update. You didn't order it, but I served it up anyway. Enjoy.


I said enjoy! Now get to it.


Today's Must
============


1. [Channel LSV—*Amonkhet* Draft](https://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-lsv-amonkhet-draft/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

That was fast! These Draft videos normally lag by at least a few days, but ChannelFireball grabbed a recording of what might be the first *Magic Online* draft of *Amonkhet*, as LSV was itching to get in there. Since there's such scant actual drafting experience out there right now, this is one of your first looks at one of the game's best players playing the latest set. That's so many adjectives!


But LSV wasn't the only one! Just the first to get the video up. Seth Manfield also jumped in right away and posted his video pretty freakin' quick on TCGPlayer as well. [Check it out here](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13921&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=4-25-2017).


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Modern *Amonkhet* Set Review](https://collected.company/2017/04/25/modern-amonkhet-set-review-129/) | Masters of Modern | Ben Bateman and Alex Kessler

Does *Amonkhet* hit for Modern? What tools does the new set bring for an old format? Does Ben Bateman have better hair than you? These questions (mostly) answered within.


1. [Black Lotus](http://stevenbelledin.blogspot.com/2017/04/black-lotus.html) | Push & Pull | Steven Belledin

Belledin talks about recreating the iconic [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) for Eternal Weekend. Sounds like a low-pressure, no-big-deal assignment.


1. [AKH Limited—Land Count and Main Deck Cyclers](http://articles.mtgcardmarket.com/akh-limited-landcount-and-maindeck-cyclers/) | MTG Card Market | Justin Robb

As people start to figure out the *Amonkhet* Limited format (it's on *Magic Online* now), the question for many players has become "How many lands do I play?" Cycling changes the math a little bit, as does embalm, so there are arguments for anywhere from fifteen to nineteen, depending on the deck. Robb breaks it down while also looking at narrow cycling cards you should or should not play every time.


A Sampling of B&R Reactions
===========================


1. [Farewell Top, We Hardly Knew Ye](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/brian-demars/farewell-top-we-hardly-knew-ye/) | ChannelFireball | Brian DeMars

I kind of feel like we knew Top pretty well. But, hold on, let me activate Top to check.


ChannelFireball didn't stop there. [Bob Huang thinks Deathrite Shaman is next](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/deathrite-is-next/) and Andrea Mengucci [wasn't a fan of the bans at all.](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/top-banned-in-legacy-gush-probe-restricted-in-vintage/)


1. [HUGE MTG News: B&R Announcement, *Ixalan*, *Iconic Masters*, *Commander 2017*, and more!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHXX0ln8ep0) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Wedge doesn't stop with just the B&R announcement. He's got *Ixalan*, HASCON, *Iconic Masters*, and more all jammed into a 10-minute video. Basically, if it happened within the past week-ish, it's in here.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHXX0ln8ep0>


1. [No Bans in Standard, Top Banned in Legacy, Mentor Nerfed in Vintage (Discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpDoKI59HeY)) | Strictly Better MTG | Dev

Dev (and his cat) react to the banned and restricted announcement from yesterday. It's a pretty even-handed discussion of the internet's thoughts around the announcement, and you can count Dev among those who didn't think anything was being banned this time around.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpDoKI59HeY>


1. [*Amonkhet* Prerelease, B&R Updates, *Iconic Masters*](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/podcast-118-amonkhet-prerelease-b-r-updates-iconic-masters?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive, ChasV, and Richard

The focus isn't necessarily the B&R, but the MTGGoldfish crew definitely gave the announcement its due. B&R discussion starts around 16 minutes in, but don't sleep on the *Amonkhet* Prerelease talk at the start.

What People Are Talking About

This happened too! I once built a [Leovold, Emissary of Trest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leovold%2C+Emissary+of+Trest) deck. In my very first game I cast it and followed up with a [Day's Undoing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day%27s+Undoing). I explained what it did to my opponents, everyone sighed—and conceded. I cackled a little bit, but it was hardly fun. So I get it. My [Yidris, Maelstrom Wielder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yidris%2C+Maelstrom+Wielder) deck will miss Leovold, but I get it.

I would actually just generally recommend checking out [Aaron Forsythe's Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron) from yesterday, as he added some comments to his B&R article to answer some (many) questions some (many) people had.

Including this as a bit of a public service announcement. It's catching some people, so we're looking at some solutions for a different interface. Stay tuned.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Red-White Exert Aggro](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34957_Netdecks-And-Chill.html) | Emma Handy | StarCityGames.com

People are mostly viewing exert as a bonus ability—something to trigger now and then to really get people. But what if you built around it? Emma Handy tried her, um, hand at that the other day and came up with an aggressive red-white deck that not only included [Always Watching](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Always+Watching) (exert's best friend), but also [Battlefield Scavenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Scavenger) as a sort of exert looting lord.


The deck itself is pretty straight forward—play efficient creatures, play [Always Watching](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Always+Watching), exert said creatures. The deck gets under [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) *and* goes over him with [Glorybringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer). Against Copy Cat, you just hit too hard and too fast for them to set up early, and [Thalia, Heretic Cathar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Heretic+Cathar), [Stasis Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare), and [Cast Out](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cast+Out) offer cleanup if needed.


But if all else fails, just remember ABE: Always. Be. Exerting.
