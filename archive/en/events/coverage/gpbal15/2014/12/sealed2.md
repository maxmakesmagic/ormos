 In the months since *Khans of Tarkir*'s release players have taken a number of divergent approaches to building their sealed pools. In this multicolor-heavy format, some look first to their lands, to see what array of colors or potential splashes their pool will allow. Some look to their rares, to see what bombs might enable them to break through a board stall or go over the top of opposing defenders. Some look to see which color is deepest, prioritizing a sleek curve and consistent mana base to quickly bring the fight to their opponent.




 The below pool consists of six *Khans of Tarkir* booster packs, just like those being opened across the event hall at Day 1 of Grand Prix Baltimore, where players will bring the strategies they've honed over months of Khans limited to bear. Each pool presents deck builders with any number of unique combinations of cards and this pool is no different.



* Strong blue-green rares and uncommons in [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler) and [Icefeather Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icefeather+Aven), but a dearth of on-color lands with which to cast them
* A low-slung curve of white creatures with multiple [Jeskai Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Student)s and a high impact rare in [Master of Pearls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Pearls)
* A [Trail of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trail+of+Mystery) and an abundance of strong, common morphs, including two [Woolly Loxodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Loxodon) and five, yes five, [Abomination of Gudul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abomination+of+Gudul)
