We're nearing the next month, which means it's time for the latest update to the FNM promos list. Behold, the wonders that await you in the coming months at a [Friday Night *Magic*](magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/friday-night-magic) near you…



March
=====



[Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), the March FNM promo card, closely mirrors the original (with art still by Zoltan Boros!). Now, though, instead of a trio of goblins emerging from shelter to rush into battle, they're fleeing a dragon who looks very, very hungry.

April
=====



April is a time of suspending disbelief, and this year it's also time to suspend some…fields? I don't know, just go with it. In April, we have this eerie rendition of [Suspension Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suspension+Field) by Seb McKinnon. Here, a shadowy dragon is now the one doing the suspending; although, if I were the person trapped in the field, I might actually be thanking my lucky stars I'm not just being eaten by the dragon.

May
===



Finally, that brings us to the new kid on the block, [Abzan Beastmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Beastmaster), a peculiar Hound Shaman who wants to grant all your card-drawing wishes…so long as he can bring his bigger buddies along. If you like big creatures and you like drawing cards, [Abzan Beastmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Beastmaster) will be your friend, too—especially if you do well in a May FNM.
