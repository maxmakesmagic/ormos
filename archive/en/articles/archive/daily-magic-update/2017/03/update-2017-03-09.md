The March 9, 2017 Update

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 9, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by *Variety* and NHL.com, two content sources I can't really say I ever envisioned myself citing in a Daily Update. Yet here we are.


Today's Must
============


1. [D.I.C.E Summit Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLx_Nt-I7Vir9GkL0tRQuYJ06Ii0eMmAC) | *Variety*

D.I.C.E Summit—D.I.C.E stands for Design, Innovate, Communicate, Entertain—is a gathering of mostly video game industry folk for a large conference and award show. The show is even put on by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. I say "mostly" video game folk because Wizards of the Coast was there again and was highlighted in two presentations, as this year's theme was "World Building," something we know a thing or five about.


You can view the talks and presentations on, of all places, *Variety*'s YouTube [playlist of the event](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLx_Nt-I7Vir9GkL0tRQuYJ06Ii0eMmAC). Or just check out the two videos below:

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Modern Masters 2017* Primer](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-379-modern-masters-2017-primer/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

In a tight hour and 18 minutes, Sutcliffe and Scott-Vargas cruise through drafting *Modern Masters 2017 Edition.* They cover the hows, the whats, and the whys for which card to pick second after you've already first-picked the [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) you've been trying to collect for ten years.


1. [Against the Odds: Four-Color Séance (Modern)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-four-color-seance-modern?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

When everyone went wild over the reprinting of the much-needed and overpowered [Séance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=S%C3%A9ance) in *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*, it was only a matter of time before noted Spike SaffronOlive started wrecking people left and right with the potent enchantment . . .


. . . and the only surprising thing about that paragraph above is that it's actually not far from the truth, as the deck actually turned out to be pretty strong. So [Séance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=S%C3%A9ance) is now almost guaranteed to start showing up in Modern queues on *Magic Online* for the next few days. Thanks, Seth.


1. [Four-Color Saheeli Deck Guide](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/95) | Hareruya English | Lukas Blohon

Fresh off nearly completing a stellar run through the *Magic Online* Championship, only to fall just short in the finals to newly refreshed Josh Utter-Leyton, Lukas Blohon is sharing his take on the deck that almost got him there—Four-Color Copycat.


1. [Reid Duke Amused by Namesake Confusion](https://www.nhl.com/goldenknights/news/reid-duke-amused-by-namesake-confusion/c-287508146) | NHL.com | Dan Marrazza

I'm not going to beat this Reid Duke/Reid Duke thing into the ground, but how often am I going to include "NHL.com" as the source of an article I'm citing? This one gets into the mix-up between the two Reids on the internet.


1. [*Modern Masters* Magic Mayhem](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-215-modern-masters-magic-mayhem/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

This episode is brought to you by the letter *m*. But when it's Megan and Maria broadcasting Magic the Amateuring, isn't every episode?


1. [Watching the MOCS Was Better than Watching a Live Event](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/watching-the-mocs-was-better-than-watching-a-live-event/) | ChannelFireball | Mike Sigrist

Count Mike Sigrist as a fan of the coverage format for the *Magic Online* Championship. Siggy talks a bit about what he thought improved, what could still improve, and what this development could mean for coverage in the future.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Possibility Storm](https://www.facebook.com/mtgpuzzles/)

Just getting started out, Possibility Storm bills itself as a *Magic* puzzle service that will be making puzzles available on a number of platforms. They've published just one puzzle so far, but the presentation is clean and the rating system is accurate (this one is rated "common," which means it's fairly easy). Check their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/mtgpuzzles/) for more information and, eventually, more puzzles.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Wow, this is a huge deal for Magic events moving forward. The folks at both CFB and Sitelines are great. <https://t.co/MGHkIzJXYu>
> 
> 
>  — Brian Kibler (@bmkibler) [March 9, 2017](https://twitter.com/bmkibler/status/839872507326844930)

Wow, indeed. You'll see (and probably have seen) a lot of chatter on [this announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/future-grand-prix-2018-and-beyond-2017-03-09) that ChannelFireball Events will be taking over *all* Grand Prix starting in 2018.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Randall Daniel's Blue-Black Control](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=112180)

I want to be clear—I didn't pick this deck just because it's pilot's name rhymes. I mean, I didn't pick this deck *entirely* because the pilot's name rhymes. That was more of a bonus. And a tiebreaker.


Either way, Randall Daniel took this pure control deck—nothing fancy, just a pile of removal and card advantage—to second place at a StarCityGames.com Invitational Qualifier. They ultimately fell to Mardu Vehicles, but such is life.


The deck operates almost entirely at instant speed, and with Mardu Vehicles, Black-Green Constrictor, and Four-Color Copycat decks pacing the format, cards like [Horribly Awry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horribly+Awry) and [Murder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder) become golden.


But the real hallmark of the deck is the sheer number of counterspells: 4 [Disallow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disallow), 2 [Horribly Awry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horribly+Awry), 2 [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), 2 [Void Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Shatter), and even a [Confirm Suspicions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confirm+Suspicions). There are even two more [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)s! Why let anyone else play, anyway?
