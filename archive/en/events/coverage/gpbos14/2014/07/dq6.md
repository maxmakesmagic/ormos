At the end of round 6 of Grand Prix Boston-Worcester, competitor Ivan Floch was disqualified for Unsporting Conduct - Improperly Determining a Winner.


Head Judge Sean Catanese issued the following statement:


"At the end of Round 6 in extra turns, Ivan Floch was found to have revealed the top card of his library as he decided whether he or his opponent was in a better position to win if the game had continued, and conceded the match in part due to the revealed card. Improperly determining a winner includes using actions which are not legal in the current game-state to determine the outcome of a match. As a result, he was disqualified from the event."
