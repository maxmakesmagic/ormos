GRAND PRIX DALLAS-FORT WORTH 2013 - ROUND 10 FEATURE MATCH
==========================================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on December 8, 2013 










Seth Manfield is aiming for a repeat of Grand Prix Toronto. Last weekend, the Grand Prix Kansas City 2013 Champion also finished Day One with an undefeated record, and it was his solid record that propelled him into the Top 8. This weekend, he is playing Blue-White Control, a deck that only plays the black mana scry lands from *Theros* for their ability to smooth draws.


His opponent for the first round of Day Two is Haibing Hu, one of the two Mono-Black Devotion players to go 9-0 in Day One.


When asked about his thoughts on the matchup, Manfield was straight-forward about his chances. “I think it's a coin flip. I have to be able to stabilize the board, and if I do, then normally I'm in good shape,” he said.


**The Games**


Unfortunately for Manfield, stabilizing the board was not an option, as a first-turn [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) robbed him of [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), and a second-turn [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) from Hu was able to come down before Manfield's [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter)s were online. Manfield's draws also did not cooperate, as he took a chance on finding another blue source to turn on his two [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve)s, which he failed to find.

“I kept a hand where I had to hit a blue or white source. I didn't really hit it, so I was in a tough situation given that he had a [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat),” he said after the match.


The [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s ultimately did their thing, and sent Manfield packing up his board for a second game.


However, the second game was more of the same. [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) on the first turn robbed Manfield of his [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter), which cleared the path for the second-turn [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) once again. While Manfield had [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), he held onto it for a turn in order to keep mana open for [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) for two turns. As a result, he took 7 damage over the course of two turns, first from the 1/1 rat, and then from two 3/3 rats when Hu played and activated a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault).


Manfield pulled the trigger on his [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) on the next turn. Hu, without a board, led with [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), seeing a hand of [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath), Aetherling, and [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). Hu discarded the Revelation, clearing the way for [Desecration Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) while Manfield was tapped low.

The [Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon) attacked in for 6 on the next turn, and [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) met [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve), Manfield putting a card on the bottom. Erebos, God of the Dead from Hu followed, and Manfield found himself having to tap out for Aetherling. A [Nightveil Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) off the top enabled Erebos to become a creature, and when [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) joined the attack, Manfield offered the handshake.


**Hu 2 – Manfield 0** 


After the match, I asked Manfield about his choice of plays in the second game. “I had a chance where I could have simply used [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) on his [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) on turn three, but I wanted to hold up [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) for [Underworld Connections](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) or [Nightveil Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter),” Manfield said. However, his draws ended up coming a turn too late in every situation, with [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) coming a turn too late to answer the [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), and then Aetherling coming too early when Manfield really needed some more answers to Hu's threats.
