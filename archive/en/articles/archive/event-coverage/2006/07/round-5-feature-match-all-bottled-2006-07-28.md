Tim Aten vs. Josh Ravitz
------------------------


Coming off his 8th-place finish at last year's U.S. Nationals and 15th-place finish at the 2005 World Championships, Josh Ravitz had his choice to qualify on rating or by his Pro Club level. Tim Aten's team :B won Grand Prix-Chicago in 2004, and is here on the same gravy train combo as Ravitz.

Aten drafted a base-green deck that touched red, blue and black and featured [Bottled Cloister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottled+Cloister) and a host of *Guildpact* monsters. Ravitz sat down wielding a removal-heavy black-red-blue concoction that tops out at [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+the+Firemind). They both came off Round 4 victories looking to extend their win streaks.


### Game 1


Ravitz started the show with a [Wee Dragonauts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts). Aten showed only forests, but had his own 1/3, a [Silhana Starfletcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhana+Starfletcher). Ravitz and Aten then both developed with a 3/3 apiece, Ravitz with a [Viashino Fangtail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Fangtail) facing down Aten's [Simic Ragworm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Ragworm).


Ravitz deployed [Entropic Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entropic+Eidolon) while Aten found a [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber) that let him power out [Torch Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Drake). The Fangtail active, Ravitz crashed the Red Zone with Eidolon and Dragonauts, but Aten was willing to fight, blocking with Drake and Starfletcher. Ravitz zotted Aten's only other creature, the [Simic Ragworm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Ragworm), with [Disembowel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel), which pumped the Dragonauts, then pinged the Starfletcher with Fangtail. Dragonauts fell to the [Torch Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Drake), but when the dust clearedâ€¦


Aten: "All my stuff is dead."


Aten committed another Starfletcher to his board of lonely lands - naming black, a color interestingly unavailable in his land mix.


Ravitz put the pedal down with [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+the+Firemind), but the dragon didn't survive Aten's mainphase [Wrecking Ball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrecking+Ball) cast thanks to that black splash. He had enough mana left over to drop [Bottled Cloister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottled+Cloister).


Ravitz kept the pressure on while Aten drew nothing fancy out of that bottle. Ravitz's Fangtail kept the combat favorable for his creatures, and he kept up the assault with [Helium Squirter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helium+Squirter).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat06/fm5_ravitzaten.jpg)*Ravitz and Aten traded a few barbs throughout the match.*
One embarrassing 2/3 [Ghor-Clan Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Savage) later, Aten packed it up. He shook his head but took his disappointing Cloister draws with good humor.


Aten 0 - Ravitz 1


### Game 2


Ravitz had access to three colors of mana by turn two off a quick [Izzet Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet), which brought him [Orzhov Euthanist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Euthanist). A grinning Aten shoved his [Surveilling Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surveilling+Sprite) deep, deep past the Red Zone, even pushing around some of Ravitz's permanents, but still only did one. He made a [Simic Ragworm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Ragworm).


Ravitz's [Orzhov Euthanist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Euthanist) showed no fear of the 3/3 and got in there. Aten, amused, took the 2, and the Ragworm died to [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) anyway. [Surveilling Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surveilling+Sprite) got in for a point -


Aten: "Am I gonna get 'boggled?"


- which enabled a fully-charged 5/6 [Ghor-Clan Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Savage). Ravitz's gutsy [Orzhov Euthanist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Euthanist) got in for 2 unblocked points again, but the counterattack from the flyer and the 5/6 brought down a bloodthirsted [Scab-Clan Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Mauler).


Ravitz: "Attack with Euthanist?"  

Aten: "Okay I'll take it again, it's been working well so far."


Getting no bites on the Little Euthanist That Could, Ravitz had to play his second [Orzhov Euthanist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Euthanist) and [Mausoleum Turnkey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey) - on a creatureless graveyard - to begin the chumping process.


Aten crashed in and only lost the Mauler, replacing it with a [Helium Squirter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helium+Squirter), and Ravitz scooped it up.


Aten 1 - Ravitz 1


### Game 3


Ravitz's initial [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) was trumped by Aten's [Steam Vents](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents).


Ravitz: "Unreal."  

Aten: "I know."


Aten ramped with [Farseek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) while Ravitz played relatively fair with an [Izzet Boilerworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Boilerworks) and basic lands. Aten asked once again whether he was walking into [Runeboggle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeboggle), but his [Simic Ragworm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Ragworm) hit play unmolested. But then -



![Wrecking Ball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wrecking+Ball)

Ravitz: "[Wrecking Ball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrecking+Ball)."  

Aten: "Obviously."


Aten tried a [Torch Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Drake), then swung into Ravitz's fresh [Helium Squirter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helium+Squirter). It got through, allowing a big turn of a bloodthirsted [Scab-Clan Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Mauler) and a [Silhana Starfletcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhana+Starfletcher). Ravitz crashed right back and made a second [Helium Squirter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helium+Squirter), grafting the new kid up to 4/4.


Aten showed enough mana to pump [Torch Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Drake) twice, and swung in with it.


Ravitz: "I'll block."  

Aten: "Are you kidding?"  

Ravitz: "No, I'll block."


Aten duly pumped, forcing a trade, and Aten made a second Starfletcher. Ravitz untapped and showed his plan by getting back the Squirter with [Mausoleum Turnkey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey), which he grafted to 4/3.


Aten showed off his mana production capabilities by tapping out for a [Sporeback Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporeback+Troll) and [Bottled Cloister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottled+Cloister). Ravitz took the opportunity to [Cackling Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cackling+Flames) the Troll, but needed some gas fast to keep up with the Cloister.


Drawing two cards per turn now, Aten plunked down a surprise [Stalking Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Vengeance) and got in there with the 5/5 Avatar and his Mauler. Ravitz shook his head, and took 8 despite trading the Mauler with his Turnkey.


Ravitz tried to construct a defense force, but Aten's personal Howling Mine combined with the [Stalking Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Vengeance)'s pings overwhelmed Ravitz in both card advantage and life. Aten's sequence of [Elvish Skysweeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Skysweeper), [Belltower Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx) and [Gruul Nodorog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Nodorog) chopped Ravitz's options to nil, and Ravitz extended the hand.
