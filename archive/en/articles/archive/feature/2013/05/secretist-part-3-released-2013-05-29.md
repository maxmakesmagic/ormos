Last week, Doug [wrote some words](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/248c) to tell you all a bit about the book series. Here's what he had to say about this book:


*In Part Three, the conflict culminates in a race through the Implicit Maze, a power-struggle between the ten warring guilds and their guildmasters, and a mystical ordeal that has been waiting ten thousand years to emerge. The dragon Niv-Mizzet draws all the guilds into the battle, leading the other guildmasters to fear a coup that would shatter the power balance of Ravnica. Jace must confront not only the secrets he's unearthed in the ancient city, but also those uncomfortable truths he has kept hidden deep inside himselfâ€”and he will face a devious enemy that is every bit his match.*


In addition to that, we provided [the first chapter](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/features/the_secretist_part3_ch1.pdf) of the new e-book for you to download and read for free! Try before you buy! It's a PDF so you'll have to be able to read that sort of file.


So if you're ready to buy, you can get the e-book for [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Maze-Secretist-Three-ebook/dp/B00AD2OXLM) or [Nook](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dragons-maze-doug-beyer/1113852017).
