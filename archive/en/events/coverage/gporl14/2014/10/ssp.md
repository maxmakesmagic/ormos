 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






 Limited Grand Prix always begin with Sealed: Opening six booster packs and building a 40 cards deck from it, including basic lands. At Grand Prix Orlando, it's *Khans of Tarkir*'s time to shine in the spotlight as its first weekend of Premier *Magic*.




 Whether you made it to your local Prerelease events, celebrated Friday Night *Magic* with its release last weekend, or you're just catching up on everything now, it's clear at a glance that *Khans of Tarkir* presents some challenging questions for players to answer in Limited. Here, six booster packs of the set yielded a mix of powerful but colorful cards – [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth) and [Sultai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Ascendancy), [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast), Bear's Companion and [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm) all – as well as several lands that might help us cast them. In less-colorful choices, cards like [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities), [Bloodsoaked Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodsoaked+Champion), [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales), and [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) pull us in different directions.



Will you build the deck the mana fixing can support? Would you find a way to play just the strongest cards possible? Can you assemble a machine to fight through nine rounds of Sealed matches?


Take your best shot and we'll share what some of the game's greats had to say about building this pool:
