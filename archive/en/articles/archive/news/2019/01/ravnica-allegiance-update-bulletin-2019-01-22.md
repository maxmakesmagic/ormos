Hey.


Yeah, you. Come here.


They say knowledge is power, and I hear you're looking for some of both. House Dimir can provide what you need.


What? What do you mean House Dimir isn't in this set? Dimir's in every set, if you know what clues to look for. I swear, kids these days have no respect for the omnipresence of shadowy infiltration organizations. Why, back in my day, people were so afraid, we would pretend that House Dimir didn't even *exist*.


Now my whole "offer you information for a cost" spiel is ruined, and I'll just have to present these rules and Oracle changes without any flair or fanfare.


(I'm totally lying.)


As usual, you'll be able to find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website, and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/)â€”at this time, one or both of those might not be updated just yet, so I'm describing a general truth here. Keep in mind that this article was written before the rules changes were finalized in editing, so there may be minor deviations from what I describe below.
