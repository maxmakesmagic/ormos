This is *not* the Booster Draft Simulator. We're not quite ready with the ***Magic** 2012* version and it seemed kind of pointless to keep doing the ***Magic** 2011* drafts.


So instead we're going to do something that will hopefully be somewhat diverting and also improve your drafting. The faster you can identify the cards in a pack, the more time you'll have for deciding what you want to draft, right? So let's see how good you are at identifying ***Magic** 2012* cards just by looking at their art!
