Shipping and production delays will impact the availability of *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* Set Boosters for the November 12 Prerelease events in the following North America locations:


**United States and Canada**


For the United States and Canada, Set Boosters will not be available for Prerelease weekend and fans should anticipate availability delays through release on November 19. Prerelease Packs, Collector Boosters, and Draft Boosters will be available for Prerelease and early sales, where available, and Draft Boosters will be used for Prerelease event prize support.


We're looking forward to getting *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* into stores and the hands of players as soon as possible, and we thank you for your patience and understanding.
