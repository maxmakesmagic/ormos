 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 





For 25-year-old Ari Lax, showing up to a Pro Tour on a Sunday to play in the feature match area was a long time coming. The Detroit native, who now lives in Boston and works as an engineer by day, has been moonlighting as a content provider for StarCityGames.com and as a weekend warrior professional *Magic* player for years. Despite having competed at the top levels for years, a Pro Tour Top 8 had always eluded him.


 


 


 


At least it had, until Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, where he made his Sunday appearance at the Pro Tour a memorable one with a win.

The Pro Tour victory had been a long time coming for Lax, who began playing the game at a very young age.


 


"I played with my cousin David while he babysat me, and I don't remember winning a single game," recalled Lax, thinking back to his *Magic* roots. "Eventually I decided to buy some cards of my own around *Urza's Saga*, and soon after I started reading Scrye magazine. I got hooked on the tournament coverage part, specifically how awesome all the winning decks were."


 


"I went straight from kitchen table play with 300-card piles to showing up to [Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena) League with 10-Land Stomp and local Extended events with Draw-Go Mono-Blue. A friend of mine told me about the Junior Super Series [a scholarship tournament series that took place in the early 2000s for younger players] a couple of years later around *[Onslaught](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onslaught)*. We spent a ton of time playtesting gauntlet matches in his basement before showing up to the event with [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) and Blue-Green Madness, and I've been playing competitive *Magic* ever since."


 


Lax's origins on the Pro Tour didn't come until much later.


 


"I spent a large number of years playing competitive *Magic* but not pursuing the Pro Tour due to the Junior Super Series requiring all competitors to have competed in no Pro Tours," Lax explained. "When the JSS finally ended, I decided to qualify for the Pro Tour."


 


His initial Pro Tour Qualifier experiences were lackluster, but by the time his third PTQ season came around, he finally earned his invitation. The event, his inaugural Pro Tour, was Kyoto in 2009. "I 'knew'—the Internet is wonderful, by the way—a bunch of people who qualified through Gavin Verhey's Team Unknown Stars, so I wasn't going alone," he noted.


 


"Kyoto was Standard from *Lorwyn* block through *Shards of Alara* and *[Conflux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflux)*. I had been playing [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) decks at basically everything from Block Constructed forward and was pretty set on playing one at the Pro Tour. A week before the Pro Tour I showed up at RIW Hobbies [a game store near his hometown in Michigan] to test and was smashed by Patrick Chapin and Kyle Boggemes playing [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) decks."


 


"Having my initial choice completely upset, I spent a couple of days testing with Jed Dolbeer and we settled on a Faeries list with a ton of Vendillion Cliques for Standard and on forcing a crazy Red-Black Aggro strategy he worked out in Draft. I do mean crazy on that draft plan; [Onyx Goblet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onyx+Goblet) and [Goblin Mountaineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Mountaineer) were archetype staples."


 


It was at the Pro Tour that he discovered a true appreciation for Faeries, and it also marked the start of his Pro Tour career.


 


"I distinctly remember the first game I played at the event," he recollected. "Having never played Faeries before, I won the die roll and played [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) on turn one. I took my opponent's second Kithkin for their [Goldmeadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow) Stalwart, played [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) on two when they had no turn one play, killed their next two plays with one [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), then tapped down their lands with [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) two turns in a row. At that moment I had this realization: That's what I could have been doing? Why wasn't I playing this deck the entire past year?”


 


I" ended up starting off 10-2 in the event but losing the last two rounds to Luis Scott-Vargas and Brian Robinson to miss top eight and finish in 15th place. I was pretty psyched to have done so well and used that finish and a follow up Grand Prix top 8 to hit Level Four (Gold) for the season. Since then I've been qualified for every Pro Tour, though I missed a couple in the middle due to school."


 


Ari Lax has come a long way, starting off his competitive *Magic* play for scholarships, and following up with a solid finish at his first Pro Tour. Despite a Top 8 eluding him for so long, it was not entirely shocking to see that he made the most of his Sunday stage debut. Now, Lax will have the chance to prove himself on *Magic*'s greatest stage at the 2015 World Championship.
