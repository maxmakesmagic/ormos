Grand Prix Kitakyushu 2009

The final point of damage has been dealt here in the southern city of Kitakyushu. Taisuke Ishii, having ridden his Sealed Deck to a perfect Day one record and Soaring Seacliffs to a Top 8 appearance, slew all comers, expertly piloting his aggressive red/white deck through a trap-laden Top 8 that consisted of some of the best Japanese players on the face of the earth. Ultimately, it was the quick and dirty Plated Geopede and Steppe Lynx that did the brunt of the load bearing. Thanks to them, Ishii was able to bear a load of his own, the weight of the trophy he received for besting Masashi Oiso in the finals to become the 2009 Grand-Prix Kitakyushu champion!

Quarterfinals - Roundup
-----------------------


*by Nate Price*

Standing in the middle of the Feature Match area, I had the King Railbird spot for this Top 8 Quarterfinals round. Unfortunately for me, this was a Top 8 at a Japanese Grand Prix. The players were almost playing faster than I could keep up. Here are the big hits:


 



![Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Welkin+Tern)

Jun'ya Iyanaga had a sick little double [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern)/[Trusty Machete](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trusty+Machete) opener in his match against Hironobu Sugaya. Backed up with an [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil), I figured this game was going to be over in a jiffy, so I wandered to the other side of the Feature Match square to keep an eye on some of the other matches. By the time I wandered back, it became clear that Iyanaga's deck hadn't given him anything beyond the great start. Sugaya had used [Hideous End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+End) to slow Iyaga down significantly and had added a fair amount of pressure of his own through Surakar Marauder and [Cobra Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobra+Trap). At this point, it was actually *Sugaya* that was taking the bigger swings. The [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) came into play eventually, though, and the [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) with a Machete in its beak finally crossed the finish line.

Jun'ya Iyanaga 1 – Hironobu Sugaya 0


Yuuya Watanabe was playing Ken Yukuhiro on one of the adjacent tables. This match ultimately came down to each player's unblockable creatures. Watanabe had [Bladetusk Boar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladetusk+Boar)s while Yukuhiro had [Windrider Eel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windrider+Eel)s. Yukuhiro had gone first, as well as hitting his land drops, and ultimately, his 4/4s were bigger than Watanabe's 3/2s, giving him the match.


Yuuya Watanabe 0 – Ken Yukuhiro 1


The titanic Quarterfinal match in the opposite corner pitted Masashi Oiso and Katsuhiro Mori, two good friends and old-timey **Magic** Pros against one another. Their first game was a battle of attrition. Mori supplied threat after threat, and Oiso dealt with each one in turn. Eventually, the one threat that stuck, the unblockable [Halo Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halo+Hunter), got to turn sideways enough times to give Mori the first game.


Katsuhiro Mori 1 – Masashi Oiso 0


In his match against Takeshi Takagi, Taisuke Ishii got the stereotypical red/white dream draw of [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx)/[Plated Geopede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede)/basic lands. It ended very shortly thereafter. The second game went nearly as fast, ending when a [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) with an [Explorer's Scope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explorer%27s+Scope) got some [Nimbus Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Wings) and crashed over Takagi's ground troops for the final seven points of damage just a few turns into the game.


Takeshi Takagi 0 – Taisuke Ishii 2


Watanabi was staring down at many fliers.


 



![River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=River+Boa)

The Oiso/Mori match had a rather anticlimactic Game 2. With Mori up a game, Oiso caught him mana flooded and just started to run over him. Eventually, the mana flood caught up with Oiso as well, but when you have an [Adventuring Gear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventuring+Gear) on a [River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa), that's not exactly a bad thing.

Katsuhiro Mori 1 – Masashi Oiso 1


Iyanaga's second game against Sugaya was much different than his first. He spent the early turns of this game coming up with answers to Sugaya's spells. Eventually, when Sugaya started to run low on threats, Iyanaga managed to get a [Bog Tatters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Tatters) in play. Once that Tatters picked up a Machete, things got violent. An [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) to clear the way later, and Iyanaga was one match closer to repeating as Kitakyushu champion.


Jun'ya Iyanaga 2 – Hironobu Sugaya 0


With all of the other matches finished, I finally got a chance to sit down and watch the Mori/Oiso match a little more in depth.


Mori got on the hot foot in the final game of his match against Oiso. [Vampire Lacerator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator) and [Surrakar Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrakar+Marauder) worked together to quickly shred Oiso's life. Oiso made a move to defend it, recruiting [Nissa Revane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa+Revane) to help him search out some of [Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Chosen) to help defend them. With the path now blocked, Mori added a [Hagra Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Crocodile) to his side to help get at Oiso. At the end of Mori's turn, Oiso had a bit of an aside with a judge trying to get some rules questions straight. After reappearing, he aimed a [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) at the Crocodile, frying it.


 



![Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nissa%27s+Chosen)

With his Chosen now in place, Oiso decided to have Nissa gain four life, two for the Chosen and two for the Sunweaver Druid he had played on the third turn. In addition, his glut of mana allowed him to kick a Moss Shambler at Mori's lone [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), neutering his ability to catch up. Now behind in lands and life, and with a relative inability to attack, Mori was in quite the tight spot. A land gave him the ability to attack Nissa with his Marauder, and he halved her loyalty to Oiso.

On Oiso's next turn, he sent his two creatures into attack. Mori shoved his Lacerator in the Shambler's way and let it die. When Oiso went to use Nissa to gain life, Mori responded with a [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) to finish the wounded beast off, getting his Fire back thanks to Nissa. Oiso would now have to be very careful about gaining life. He just played a [Oran-Rief Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oran-Rief+Recluse) and passed the turn.


An [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) from Mori let his Marauder attack Nissa down to one. Now, the giants started coming down on Mori's side. [Shatterskull Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatterskull+Giant)s, to be exact. Oiso had some giants of his own, putting a [Gigantiform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) on his Spider, creating a giant spider even more giant than [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider). With this massive monster in play, and Mori [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)less, it seemed like the game was well in hand. A couple of turns later, that was proven correct.


Katsuhiro Mori 1 – Masashi Oiso 2




Semifinals - Roundup
--------------------


*by Nate Price*

With Watanabe out of the Top 8, the favorite to take the title here in Kitakyushu had to be Masashi Oiso. Unfortunately for him, the man he had to beat to make it to the finals was the very same Ken Yukuhiro who had run his [Windrider Eel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windrider+Eel)s all over the PoY leading Watanabe. On the other side of the bracket, Iyanaga and Ishii were locked in an aggressive battle. Both players had blazing starts, with Ishii getting a [Plated Geopede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede) and [Cliff Threader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cliff+Threader) to Iyanaga's [Surrakar Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrakar+Marauder) and [Umara Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umara+Raptor). Ishii took to the sky, giving his [Cliff Threader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cliff+Threader)s some [Nimbus Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Wings). He added a second Threaders soon after.


 



![Devout Lightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Devout+Lightcaster)

Back on the other table, Oiso was forced to use a [Harrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) to find a second green source for his [Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Chosen) that would have preferred that Oiso was able to save it for the [Adventuring Gear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventuring+Gear) in play. No one can have everything, though, and Oiso was forced to settle for being able to play his spells. Shucks. Yukuhiro, on the other hand, went for the first five turns of the game with no [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s for his many [Windrider Eel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windrider+Eel)s. He was able to take advantage of his many [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) for a [Devout Lightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devout+Lightcaster) and later on for an [Arrow Volley Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Volley+Trap) that ate a [Kazuul Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazuul+Warlord) and the Chosen. Once he did manage to start bringing in the Eels, Oiso was ready for the first with a [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning). The second wasn't as quick to arrive as in his previous match, unfortunately for him.

Back to the other side, left to right on your radio dial, Ishii hit a patch of ice, slowing down incredibly. With Iyanaga getting a [Trusty Machete](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trusty+Machete) to wedge in his Raptor's beak, he was able to take out the big, flying Threader and assert some control over the board. Ishii had drawn an [Explorer's Scope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explorer%27s+Scope) and land, preventing him from gaining any more of an advantage. He was going to have to ride his Geopede and Scope to eke this one out. Unfortunately, while he was waiting to draw some lands to turn his Geopede on, Iyanaga was drawing cards like [Umara Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umara+Raptor) and [Hagra Diabolist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Diabolist). Combined with his Machete (man, this card is good), he was able to finally start attacking. He was on two life from all of Ishii's early beats, so he had to wait until he was sure of his defense before he started trying to Kill Ishii.


While I was watching this game, Oiso managed to plop a [Gigantiform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) on one of his creatures to take his first game. The second game didn't start as well for him. While he built up his mana base, Yukuhiro built up his air force with two Eels and a [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern). Oiso was just too far behind by the time he started playing spells, and Yukuhiro just didn't let up, taking the second game just as Ishii had stolen the other match's first with a topdecked [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning).


 



![Makindi Shieldmate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Makindi+Shieldmate)

Oiso got to be the aggressive on in his last game. An [Oran-Rief Survivalist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oran-Rief+Survivalist) picked up some [Adventuring Gear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventuring+Gear) before smashing over for four. His trusty pet [River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa) joined him soon after. When [Nissa Revane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa+Revane) joined to add a [Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Chosen) to the mix, it looked bad for Yukuhiro. And then he made two [Makindi Shieldmate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Shieldmate)s, effectively neutering Oiso's attack. In addition, his source of blue was a [Sejiri Refuge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sejiri+Refuge), preventing the Boa from [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)walking. Oiso managed to get through the larger one, using [Harrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) as it was intended: as a pump spell.

On the other table, Ishii got to go [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx), [Cliff Threader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cliff+Threader), [Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) to start his second game. A Scope on the Lynx made things even dirtier, and Iyanaga was forced to play defense by giving his [Umara Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umara+Raptor) a [Spidersilk Net](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spidersilk+Net). Over two consecutive turns, Raptors died to [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) and [Magma Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Rift) as Iyanaga slumed against the palm of his hand.


Oiso decided to put [Gigantiform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) on his Survivalist, a play that had thus far meant he was winning the game. Yukuhiro had a Hookmaster to shut it down after one attack, though, and his fliers looked to turn this into a real race. He was at a terribly low four to Oiso's twenty, and was going to have to take the restrictor plate off if he was going to get there. Add to that the *second* [Gigantiform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) Oiso had for his [River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa), and it looked like he had brought a knife to a laser fight.


Giants. Rawr.


Right as that was finishing up, Ishii was putting some pants of his own onto the little [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) that could. His [Nimbus Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Wings) ensured that his eggs were firmly in one basket, and Ishii rode his Lynx every attack step until Iyanaga fell. And fall he did.


Masashi Oiso and Taisuke Ishii advance to the finals.




Finals – Taisuke Ishii vs. Masashi Oiso
---------------------------------------


*by Nate Price*

The stage was set. Cordoned off in an increasingly empty part of the event hall, the finals of Grand Prix-Kitakyushu was about to start. Despite the rapidly vanishing furniture, the space seemed more stuffed than if had at any point during the weekend. The spectators ringing the table were three deep as Masashi Oiso and Taisuke Ishii shuffled up. As the head judge was announcing the start of the match to the assembled masses, I had to resist the urge to grab the microphone, kick up a little “Final Countdown” by Europe, and announce the players in my best Michael Buffer voice.


Ishii hit the ground running, as red/white is meant to do. [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) and [Plated Geopede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede) are always a threat to end any game before it really starts, and this time was no different. [Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Chosen) provided Oiso with a little protection, but a [Kor Hookmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Hookmaster) from Ishii took it out of the picture for a couple turns, which might end up being the rest of the game. When Oiso tried to make a [Turntimber Basilisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turntimber+Basilisk), Ishii fried it with a [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning). Oiso slowed the beats some with an [Inferno Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Trap), taking out the first-striking Geopede. He added a [Timbermaw Larva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timbermaw+Larva) to his squad, but it immediately traded with Ishii's Hookmaster. Thanks to [Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere), this left Oiso no defenders for Ishii's [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx), which knocked Oiso to eight.


Thankfully, Oiso had stalled long enough to find the perfect answer to his predicament. A kicked Moss Shambler took out the Journey, returning his [Nissa's Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Chosen) to active duty. Ishii added the “less than aggressive” [Pillarfield Ox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillarfield+Ox) to his team. On his next turn, Oiso orphaned the Ox with a [Torch Slinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Slinger) aimed at the [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx). Oiso started to assault, sending his Chosen and [River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa) into attack, while leaving the Shambler back on defense. Slowly, he started to even up the life totals. Eventually, they were even enough that he was able to get the Shambler in on offense as well. The death knell was when Oiso was able to do something I thought might be impossible in draft: kick his [Gigantiform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) to get his second copy. I feel dirty just writing that.


Taisuke Ishii 0 – Masashi Oiso 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkit09/finals1.jpg)*You would be laughing, too, if you'd just kicked a Gigantiform*Even Ishii had to laugh at the manner of his own death. One [Gigantiform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigantiform) was probably enough to do him in, but even he could appreciate the rarity of being able to actually kick the rare enchantment. It made the crowd pretty excited, too, as a raucous rumble passed through as Oiso searched through his deck.


Ishii started down a card in the second game, but, as the Martin Juza Law of Not Losing™ clearly states, if he wanted to win, he had to mulligan.


His second draw, while keepable, was a little slower than his first game's opener. He did manage to get the [Plated Geopede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede) online early, so it wasn't like it was *that* much slower than the first. Oiso had a fairly solid opener as well. [Oran-Rief Survivalist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oran-Rief+Survivalist) came down alongside a [River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa) and a [Greenweaver Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenweaver+Druid). Ishii kept the pressure with his own landwalking [Cliff Threader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cliff+Threader)s. He even managed to find a [Torch Slinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Slinger)s to kill the Druid. This was important since Oiso had missed a fourth land drop the turn he played it. Oiso's fast draw had ground to a halt. Without the resources to keep up, the normally lightning-quick Oiso was forced to start really thinking about how to get back into the game. Ultimately, he just added an [Adventuring Gear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventuring+Gear) to his side and passed the turn back with Regeneration mana up. The mana was quickly made moot as Ishii played a Hookmaster to lock down the Boa. This forced Oiso to chump the Geopede with his Survivalist to survive. Ishii played his last card after combat: another Geopede. Oiso had an [Inferno Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Trap) to deal with the Threaders, but that was it. He left his fate in the hands of Ishii's deck. The deck chose to provide Ishii with the [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) he needed to trigger both of his Geopedes and even up the match.


Once again, the Juza Law (not to be confused with more hit-or-miss Jude Law) held up under scrutiny.


Taisuke Ishii 1 – Masashi Oiso 1


Oiso, the perceptive player he is, quickly threw away his first hand, realizing that the key to Ishii's win must have been in his mulligan. Ishii soon followed suit, unwilling to fall behind.


Oiso began with an [Adventuring Gear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventuring+Gear) that was dropped into play alongside a [River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa). Ishii had the first of his Geopedes and a [Kazandu Blademaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazandu+Blademaster) to be aggressive, b-e aggressive. When Oiso tapped out for a [Greenweaver Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenweaver+Druid), Ishii aimed a [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) at the defenseless snake. Oiso got some defense on the board with a 1/4 [Joraga Bard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joraga+Bard) and an [Oran-Rief Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oran-Rief+Recluse). Despite this surge in defense, what he really needed was a surge in lands. He was stuck on three [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s. While he had the Druid to make more mana, he could probably have used some red mana to help dig him a way out. For the meantime, his lack of [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s was preventing Ishii's mountainwalking [Cliff Threader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cliff+Threader) from being too big a nuisance. A [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks) on the Threader gave Oiso the chance to kill it before he drew a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), as well as save some damage, and he blocked it with his Recluse.


As if on cue, he drew a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and started by aiming an [Inferno Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Trap) at Ishii's Blademaster. That left him with just a Geopede and a [Kor Outfitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Outfitter) in play. The Outfitter got some [Nimbus Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Wings), and a [Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) pushed the last of Oiso's true defenders out of the picture. Oiso's back was really against the wall. After a great deal of thought, brow furrowing, and squinting, Oiso decided to take the four damage. Oiso drew his card, thought for yet another seeming eternity, and attacked with his Druid. After combat, he played an unfortunately unkicked [Torch Slinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Slinger) and passed the turn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkit09/Finals2.jpg)*Ishii can just picture the cup in his hands.*Ishii drew his card for the turn. It was a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to turn his Geopede on. After playing it, he sent his two three-power creatures on an attack. Oiso took it, dropping to seven. Ishii had a [Mark of Mutiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+Mutiny) to steal Oiso's [Torch Slinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Slinger), sending it in at its former master. This would have forced Oiso to give up his source of extra mana, having to block with the Druid. Instead, Oiso threw an [Inferno Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Trap) at the winged Outfitter and took the rest, dropping to one. Now, he sent his [Torch Slinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Slinger) in to attack.


Ishii was at zero cards in hand, but still held a slightly favorable position for the time being. Rather than wait for things to potentially get worse, he summoned the heart of the cards and plucked a second [Mark of Mutiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+Mutiny) from the top of his deck to a roar from the crowd. He aimed it at Oiso's lone blocker, and Oiso extended his hand.


Taisuke Ishii defeated Masashi Oiso to become your 2009 Grand-Prix Kitakyushu Champion!
