We're sure you're eager to see some *Alara Reborn* cards. But we're not quite ready to show them to you. We are, however, ready to show you the booster packs. You know, so you know what to look for when the *Alara Reborn* jones hits.

Ah, yes. The *Alara Reborn* pack in its natural state. Observe the handsome plumage, which says "Alara Reborn." And the angel.
