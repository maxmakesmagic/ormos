2008 Great Britain National Championship
========================================




August 15-17, 2008











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat08/gb_team.jpg)Jonathan Randle, Too Hot To Handle!


When I asked Jon Randle if he had any great suggestions for captions for pictures of him in the coverage, only the title above came to mind. As it turned out it was quite prophetic. His Faeries deck was one of only a handful in the tournament, but it proved to be the equal of everything that it faced all weekend. He bested a pair of Reveillark decks along with Mono-Red to become the champion - a fair reflection of the most played decks in the tournament.


Joining him on the Great Britain National Team are Stephen Murray of Scotland, who has previously been a champion himself, and Ioannis Kyriazis, who has been close to top 8 of nationals for years, and this time filled an ambition that had been some time in coming to fruition.


Now these three will be frantically testing for Worlds in Memphis, Tenessee, where they compete for their nation, looking to go even further, becoming the best in the world.
