*We're taking a two-week holiday break and will be back with new stuff on Monday, January 2, 2012. Until then, please enjoy our favorite Arcanas of 2011. This article originally ran May 25, 2011.*


It's time for the finale of Core Set Survivor! But first, let's recap how we got here and explain the concept for people who just got here.

The original **Magic** core set was *Limited Edition Alpha*, which contained [285 cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=%5B%22Limited+Edition+Alpha%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Basic%22%5D), not counting basic lands. Then all of those cards were reprinted in *Limited Edition Beta*, which also added [Circle of Protection: Black](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Black) and [Volcanic Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Island), which had been mysteriously left out of Alpha.

Then *Revised* had a slightly different set of cards, and only 250 of the cards from Alpha were still in the core set. *Fourth Edition* changed the core set again, and only 211 cards had been in every core set.

You get the idea. Here's the complete breakdown:


> ***Alpha***: [285](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=%5B%22Limited+Edition+Alpha%22%5D&type=+!%5B%22Basic%22%5D)  
> ***Revised***: [250](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/outwit-outplay-outlast-2005-07-25-3)  
> ***Fourth Edition***: [211](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/outwit-outplay-outlast-2005-07-25-5)  
> ***Fifth Edition***: [151](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/outwit-outplay-outlast-2005-07-25-7)  
> ***Sixth Edition***: [79](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/outwit-outplay-outlast-2005-07-25-9)  
> ***Seventh Edition***: [60](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/outwit-outplay-outlast-2005-07-25-11)  
> ***Eighth Edition***: [40](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/outwit-outplay-outlast-2005-07-25-13)  
> ***Ninth Edition***: [24](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/outwit-outplay-outlast-2005-07-25-15)  
> ***Tenth Edition***: [16](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/askwizards/0908#survivor)  
> ***Magic 2010***: [8](/en/articles/archive/core-set-survivor-magic-2011-edition-2010-06-09)  
> ***Magic 2011***: 2

That's right. In ***Magic** 2011* there were only two cards that had appeared in every core set since *Alpha*. They're [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) and [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider).

This might be a good time to revisit a "Tales From the Pit" panel from [Mark's column](/en/articles/archive/mana-action-2011-05-23) from Monday:

![Giant Growth vs. Giant Spider](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/mm/mm144_comic3.jpg)  
Well, guess what? Only one of these two cards is in ***Magic** 2012*. We're about to crown a winner in Core Set Survivor! So... to see the winner... of Core Set Survivor... please pause two minutes and watch some advertisements... and then come back here... congratulations... to the card... called Giant... click here!

Congratulations to **Giant Spider**, the winner of Core Set Survivor! The only card, as of ***Magic** 2012*, to appear in *every* core set of **Magic: The Gathering**!
