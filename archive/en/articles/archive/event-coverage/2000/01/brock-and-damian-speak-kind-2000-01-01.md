**Brock Parker:** The tournament went well. I got lucky in some matchups and the deck played out well.  
**SS:** Why did you decide to play The Solution?  
**BP:** Because I did well with it at Denver and didn't like the Dark Domain deck that my friends were playing.  
**SS:** How do you think you will do in the Top 8?  
**BP:** I'm not sure. I think I may have a few good matchups, but I really don't know how things will go.  
**SS:** Did anything happen to you interesting?  
**BP:** Not really...  
**SS:** All right, thanks!

**Damian Brown-Santirso:** Good.  
**SS:** What made you decide to play Mexican Lobotomy?  
**DB:** Because Lobotomy is a card that I wanted to run 4 of in my main deck, but I wanted something more aggressive than Go-Mar.  
**SS:** How do you think you will do in the Top 8?  
**DB:** I think I have a good chance of winning.  
**SS:** Anything interesting happen to you?  
**DB:** Multiple times, neither my opponent nor I had any cards in hand, and I ripped a Crosis off the top.  
**SS:** How lucky! Well, good luck in the Top 8!
