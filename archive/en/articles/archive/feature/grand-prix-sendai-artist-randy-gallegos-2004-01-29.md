At the beginning of 2000, Randy quietly stepped out of the radar of commercial illustration- one he'd worked in non-stop since leaving the California College of Arts and Crafts in 1994. His art, richly colored and moody, had gained him a steady stream of work and opportunities to explore many types of subject matter. This work found him featured on the cover of the Duelist magazine along with an interview within a couple years of beginning.

Perhaps it was the pace of the work he'd taken on- too many pieces, not enough time devoted to some of them. Perhaps it was the industry conditions at large- low pay, high demands. Perhaps it was his own heavy, overbearing self-critical nature. Whatever it was, Randy realized that something had to change for the sake of his art and his future as an artist.

He produced few paintings, and entered a stage of difficult artistic metamorphosis- a questioning of motive, technique, desire, ambition and every other facet of creative life. During this time he focused on his music, playing bass and singing and writing with alt-rock band Plumage, and working on-staff as a graphic artist in the video game industry for a year. The paintings done during the period were of an eclectic nature, often testing the water of various directions as he sought to reestablish his visual voice. Or, as he was coming to recognize, his artistic voices.

Slowly, he is emerging from this cocoon, paralleled visually though not thematically in his continuing and intriguing God v.2.0 series. As summer of '02 winds down, he looks forward to his own continuing eclosion and the shedding of the skin he's long-since outgrown. He's always moved slowly but deliberately, and with firm steps; and now is no different. But he's on the move.
