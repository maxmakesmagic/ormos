Welcome to our latest look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings, and another double-header weekend of Grand Prix action. In Japan, [Nagoya](/en/events/coverage/kasuga-drops-hammer-nagoya) was the venue, while [Philadelphia](/en/events/coverage/grand-prix-philadelphia-coverage) hosted North American action, with both cities featuring *Theros*/*Born of the Gods* Limited. Nagoya saw two of the three biggest movers on the weekend. Hong Kong's Lee Shi Tian has an excellent track record, most recently when making the Top 8 of  [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](/en/events/coverage/ptbngs14) in Valencia. In Nagoya, he had to settle for 3 additional Pro Points, thanks to a 13th-place finish. Even so, in a tightly packed group in the rankings, those points were enough to take him past Josh Utter-Leyton, Alexander Hayne, Jacob Wilson, Stanislav Cifka, and Willy Edel, up five places to No. 10. 

 The other climber to come out of Nagoya was Kentaro Yamamoto, another player who has a Pro Tour Top 8 to his name this season, in this case from [Pro Tour *Theros*](/en/events/coverage/ptthr13) back in Dublin, last year. In Nagoya, his efforts were good enough for 32nd place, and that's a good place to be, since it nets a 2nd Pro Point for being inside the Top 32. His ranking shifts upwards by three to No. 22. 

Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, David Ochoa also rose three spots, climbing from No. 24 up to No. 21, bypassing Chris Fennell, Raphaël Lévy, and Martin Juza. Although he was the biggest mover in terms of points, he wasn't the most successful, since both William Jensen and No. 2 Reid Duke both added another Grand Prix Top 8 to their career highlight reels. Nonetheless, with the five Grand Prix Cap Rule in operation—points are only awarded for the best five GP finishes across the season—Jensen's quarterfinal exit didn't gain him any points, while Duke edged closer to the No. 1 ranked Jérémy Dezani.

 Now we enter a quiet few weeks on the Pro scene, with the focus squarely on Journey Into Nyx. Join us next week for more on the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
