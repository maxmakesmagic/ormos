We're pretty close to January, at least so far as DailyMTG will have new content (we're going into "Best of" mode December 19–January 1), so it's time to announce the promos that Friday Night *Magic* players can look forward to over the next three months. They are shiny, and soon they can all be yours.


**January**


[Noose Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor) plays a loose role in Standard right now, serving as a discard outlet for a number of powerful graveyard-centric strategies. This [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) update has been used in several powerful tournament decks to block fliers, put cards in the graveyard, and just generally serve as a menacing Snake.

**February**


In February, attend an FNM and then pick a hand, any hand—no, not that hand. The other one. In it you'll find this promo version of [Fortune's Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune%27s+Favor) by Grzegorz Rutkowski, whose art is as fantastic as his name is difficult to spell.

**March**


Things start to warm up in March, in more ways than one, as long as you're in the Northern Hemisphere. But no matter which hemisphere you reside in, you can warm up for FNM with [Incendiary Flow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Flow), the March Friday Night *Magic* promo featuring art from Slawomir Maniak and the best kind of flavor text—sassy Chandra flavor text.
