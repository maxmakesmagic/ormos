*Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts Tomorrow
----------------------------------


Get ready for all the tribal shenanigans you can handle! *Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts start tomorrow, February 27, on *Magic Online*. Just remember: [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer) may look like an alien made of jelly, but it is definitely a Treefolk. And also a Goblin. It's a weird and wonderful world.


You can find the *Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby, February 27 through March 6, and players may enter with any of the following options: 10 Event Tickets; 2 *Lorwyn* boosters + 2 Event Tickets; or 100 Play Points.




---

UMA Flashback Drafts March 6
----------------------------


*Ultimate Masters* Drafts are back by popular demand! If you missed the action last time, not to worry—UMA Flashback Drafts start March 6 and end March 13—a whole week to draft your favorite bombs.


Players may enter with any of the following options: 10 Event Tickets; 1 *Ultimate Masters* booster + 3 Event Tickets; or 100 Play Points.

March, April, and May MCQs
--------------------------


Mythic Championship Qualifier events for Mythic Championship Barcelona have been added to our [Event Calendar](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/schedule-magic-online-products-game-info).


You can also view dates [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-mythic-championship-qualifiers) alongside additional Mythic Championship Qualifier event info.

MCQ Preliminary Time Change
---------------------------


As a result of feedback from the community, the MCQ Preliminary event held at 3 a.m. PT on Saturday mornings will now take place one hour earlier—that is, 2 a.m. PT on Saturdays. All other MCQ Preliminaries remain unchanged.




---

Vintage Super League Week 7
---------------------------


VSL is entering Week 7, so don't miss your chance to get a weekly dose of ridiculously powerful *Magic* every Tuesday evening. The deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy VSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about one of *Magic*'s deepest formats!


Check it out this Tuesday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).


Ready to start playing? [Grab a deck](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/deck-lists-magic-online-products-game-info) and join the Vintage League for matches any time or play for greater rewards with the Vintage Challenge every Saturday at 10 a.m. PT.
