**Ivan Floch:** [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). I haven't really played Standard since the Pro Tour, but from what I've seen the card is played everywhere. If not in the main deck it's in people's sideboards.

**Fabrizio Anteri:** I have to say [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). It's the best card in the best archetype, which I think is Hangarback Abzan.

**Thoralf Severin:** [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). Because it's both resilient and flexible.

**Andrea Mengucci:** The best new card is [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), but the best card remains to be [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). It's a 2-for-1 no matter what and some decks can't deal with it.
