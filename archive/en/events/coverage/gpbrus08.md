Grand Prix Brussels 2008
------------------------


Cornelissen Claims Victory in Brussels
======================================




May 3-4












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbru08/champ_kamiel_cornelissen.jpg) Kamiel Cornelissen fought his way through a Top 8 full of **Magic** celebrities, first beating Alexandre Peset in the quarterfinals, then Raphael Levy in the semis, and finally besting Gabriel Nassif in an epic three-game match.


Whereas today most players had opted for aggressive strategies in the brand new *Shadowmoor* Booster Draft format, the two finalists were prepared to take the fight to the lategame. There, Cornelissen's blue-black construction, featuring [Isleback Spawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isleback+Spawn) and [Ghastlord of Fugue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastlord+of+Fugue), triumphed over Nassif's red-green ramp-style deck.


Congratulations to Kamiel Cornelissen, the champion of Grand Prix Brussels 2008!
