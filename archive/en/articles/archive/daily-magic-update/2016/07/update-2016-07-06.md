The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 6, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by non-English previews—hoping they're not swearing with every post.


Today's Previews
================


Throughout preview season, I'll use this space to highlight the day's previews that can't be found on DailyMTG. Worried you might miss something? We'll make sure to have it here.


1. [Exclusive *Eldritch Moon* Preview Card: Dark Salvation!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33231_Exclusive-Eldritch-Moon-Preview-Card-Dark-Salvation.html) | Michael Majors | StarCityGames.com

Liliana—saving the day? She might just be. Check out this preview article to see how her and her horde of Zombies are riding in to win the day.


1. [Spoiler Exclusivo de *Lua Arcana*: Folião do Caos #MTGEMN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC17BwG34bA) | BlackerLotus (Portuguese)

In English, the card is known as Bedlam Reveler—and bedlam is exactly what this thing is going to cause on the battlefield. You can get a decent translation of the card on [the Reddit thread discussing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4rih5m/emnchaos_reveler/). Except the name, which is not "Chaos Reveler."


Fun fact: There are only three creatures with the word "Chaos" in their titles, and [only 21 cards total](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5bchaos%5d). Of those 21, every single one is red, except for three artifacts and, oddly enough, a blue enchantment.


The video below is in Portuguese.

1. [Fortune's Favor Is Our *Eldritch Moon* Preview!](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/fortunes-favor/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

Who better to talk about this Fact or Fiction–like card than Flores and Chapin? No one. That's why I gave it to them. At any rate, this blue card-draw spell is another interesting turn on the bluffing game. Check it out.


1. Additionally, look for two more Twitter preview cards today from the set's leads—Ken Nagle ([@NorrYtt](https://twitter.com/NorrYtt)) and Sam Stoddard [@samstod](https://twitter.com/samstod) #whereismypreviewcard.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [This Week in Legacy: Introduction to Legacy](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/this-week-in-legacy-introduction-to-legacy) | MTGGoldfish | Sean Brown

As someone who is building my first real-life Legacy deck (Miracles, because of course. Do you know me at all?), I found this really useful. I've been following the format for years and playing online, but this article streamlines everything and breaks down the format well. If, like me, *Eternal Masters* piqued or renewed your interest in the format, this is a great place to start.


1. [*Eldritch Moon* First Look](http://www.crcast.com/podcasts/constructed-resources-52-eldritch-moon-first-look/) | Constructed Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Eric Froehlich

There are a lot of "first looks" going around right now, but you can reliably get an honest take from Froehlich on a card's viability in Constructed. Marshall, on the other hand, mostly looks for the words "draw a card" or "return target creature to its owner's hand," and then moves on. Rightfully so.


1. [Twitter Question Marathon](https://rocketjump.com/listen/twitter-question-marathon) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

If, like me, you follow the [Masters of Modern on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theMMcast), your feed a few days ago might have been inundated with all kinds of random questions and retweeted answers. Your finger might have even hovered over the unfollow button. There were a lot of Qs and As. But, sticking through was worth it, because it resulted in this interesting potpourri episode full of interesting questions, thoughts, and weird answers. Definitely worth a listen. And a follow.


Top 25
======


1. Pascal Maynard has entered the battlefield

Pascal Maynard has been a household name in the *Magic* world ever since he pursuit of a World Championship slot last year, but just this weekend he marked his ascension to Platinum and his entrance into the hallowed Top 25 rankings. Alongside Brian Braun-Duin (the currently leader for that Grand Prix Master slot at the World Championship) and Shaheen Soorani, Maynard made the Top 4 of Grand Prix Sao Paulo and, subsequently, the Top 25.


His ascension came at the expense of Rookie of the Year ringer Oliver Tiu, who dropped off the rankings shortly after getting his first taste. I have a feeling he'll be back.


The only other movement this week was Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, who is up two spots.

What People Are Talking About
=============================

We're quite relieved to be seeing these reports coming in. It looks like visa issues, for Americans at the very least, are being resolved for Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* in Australia. Now the only thing holding people back is the fact that Australia is a death trap waiting to devour you in a pile of snakes, sharks, and whatever a wallaby is.

This is pretty cool. A new sponsored team has popped up for the StarCityGames.com tour. There are a number of notable SCG players on the roster, but the most interesting thing is the split into two "tiers" essentially—a Prime team and an Academy team. Presumably, the Prime team gets free shipping.


Decks of the Day
================


1. Elder Deep-~~Fried~~Fiend

Two deck builders put together Elder Deep-Fiend decks today. On ChannelFireball, [Frank Karsten went, um, deep, with the flashy Eldrazi](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/cooking-with-elder-deep-fiend/). And on TCGPlayer, Ali Aintrazi [brewed up several decks, one of which featured the calamari Eldrazi](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13369&writer=Ali+Aintrazi&articledate=7-5-2016). There have been a lot of comparisons to [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), a card that absolutely dominated Standard in its day, so be prepared for more deep-fried recipes featuring one Elder Deep-Fiend.
