*Commander (2018 Edition)* Cards Coming in December
---------------------------------------------------



While *Guilds of Ravnica* will deliver most of the remaining new *Battlebond*'s cards, our focus on that set left us less time to work on C18 than we had hoped. Since we'll need to do another cardset release to get those cards to you, we have scheduled such a release for the next available opportunity: early December. The current plan is that this release will include *all* the new cards in C18. We'll have more details as we get closer.
