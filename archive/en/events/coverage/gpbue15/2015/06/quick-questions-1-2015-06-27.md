**What staple of the current Standard format was the biggest surprise for you?**


Though many cards looked like Standard-powered cards when they were released, what standout card did you not expect to see at the top tables in this last season?

**Pascal Maynard** - [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) seemed very slow when we tested for the Pro Tour. Since then, the format has slowed down a lot and the card has proven itself to be very powerful.

**Thiago Saporito** - There weren’t many surprises for me, but I would say [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) if I had to pick. I knew [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) was good from the beginning, but I didn’t know it would be *this* good.

**Ben Stark** - [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen). I wasn’t surprised it was *good*, but I was very surprised when it started showing up in Constructed Decks. It basically came out of nowhere.

**Willy Edel** - All the Dragonlords. Everybody knew about [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) and [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka), but even [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) and [Dragonlord Dromoka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Dromoka) are quite good. I mean, sometimes we need a [Baneslayer Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel), and Dromoka is really fine for that.

**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa** - If Willy answered [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) already, I will say [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon). I thought that manabases wouldn’t be able to support it—only like, Mono-Red decks would play it or something. But it turns out it’s *fixing* your mana instead.

**Craig Wescoe** - Usually I’m the only person playing aggressive White creatures, but [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) has become a staple in the new Mardu decks that have been doing well. It’s especially surprising because it’s more of a Jeskai card that happened to be adopted into Mardu by the masses.

**Luis Salvatto** - [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) was terrible a few months ago. No good player would touch the card. Now, [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) has become very good in Standard. I did not expect that to happen with all the dragons that have flying.
