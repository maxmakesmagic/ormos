Yes, of course!
*Journey into Nyx* releases this Friday, and with it comes Quest #8 on the [Hero's Path](http://archive.wizards.com/Promo/HerosPath/Default.aspx#)! It is also in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?sort=cn+&output=standard&set=%5B%22Journey%20into%20Nyx%22%5D), so feel free to search through its cards at your leisure!
Many questions about *Journey into Nyx* are answered in the [Release Notes](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/faq/jou). And you can refresh your memory of the set's mechanics with the "[Mechanics of *Journey into Nyx*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/journeyintonyxmechanics)" article.
If you're curious about the design and development of *Journey into Nyx*, make sure to check out [Making **Magic**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=making%20magic&description=making%20magic), [Latest Developments](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/archive.aspx?tag=latest%20developments&description=latest%20developments), [Ethan Fleischer's lead-designer feature](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/294), and [Dave Humpherys's lead-developer article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/295).
Finally, you might have heard a rumor about so-called "God packs" appearing at Prereleases, which contain all fifteen of the Gods from the entire block. Well, [it's no rumor](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1481). If you open one, please share a photo with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering)! :) |
