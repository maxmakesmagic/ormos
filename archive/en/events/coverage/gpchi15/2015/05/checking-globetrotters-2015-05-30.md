The *Modern Masters* Grands Prix might be held in only three cities, but it is far from being an event for just the United States of America, the Netherlands, and Japan. As a matter of fact, almost 30 Nationalities are represented here in Chiba this weekend, a testament of the globality of the game.

Almost 95% of the participants in Chiba are Japanese, but here is very brief rundown of the Top 5 groups of foreign attendees and how they're doing so far!


Chinese Taipei
==============


Almost forty players have flown in from Chinese Taipei. Naturally, World *Magic* Cup Champion Tzu Ching Kuo is here but the one who is performing the best would be Huang Hao-Shan who just won his Round 7 match to go undefeated.

"I managed to survive my opponent's deck containing [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite). I got crushed by it in the first game but in the next two, he didn't draw it at all! Lucky me!"


South Korea
===========


Thirty Korean players made the trip. The most notable players include Platinum Pro Nam Sung Wook and Grand Prix Minneapolis Champion Park Jun Young.


However, the best performers are Grand Prix Shanghai Top 8 Competitor Oh Joohyun and World *Magic* Cup Team Member Lee Soon Joo, both at 6-1 records.


Hong Kong
=========


Similarly, there are also around thirty players from Hong Kong.


Leading the pack are No. 3 Lee Shi Tian, who made Top 8 at Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* and his close friend Yam Wing Chun, who made Top 16 at the very same Pro Tour. Lee needs just one more win out of the final two matches if he wished to hit the Draft tables tomorrow, while Yam would need to win out.

Regardless, they seem to be having a lot of fun as they try to figure out what was the best way to construct a good deck from Yam's terrible sealed pools. Nam Sung Wook watches on with equal amusement.


Singapore
=========


More than twenty players have flown nearly seven hours to arrive in Chiba from Singapore. The contingent includes three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Soh Weng Heng, as well as Grand Prix Bangkok Top 8 competitor Tan Chin Heng and Singapore National Champion Benedict Lee.


Heng Chye Hwee, who will be attending Pro Tour *Magic Origins* in Vancouver, is currently outperforming the rest of his comrades and is still undefeated at the moment!

Malaysia
========


There were also more than twenty competitors from Malaysia. Two-time National Champion Joe Soh is the most notable player but he is not doing as well as he wishes. Currently at 5-2, he would need to rattle off two wins in a row before he could advance.

Local Defense
=============


But of course, the Japanese are all about defending their turf. No 5. Yuuya Watanabe, along with Hall-of-Famers Makihito Mihara and Kenji Tsumura are all at 7-0 at the moment, and three of them are all playing in separate brackets!

*No. 5 Yuuya Watanabe has already booked his seat for tomorrow's draft tables!*


Quick report complete! Over and out!
