![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkl02/a976.jpg)Malaysia's Michael Tan is one of those players quietly earning a strong local reputation without the high-profile finished to back it up. Recently, he made Top 16 at Grand Prix - Singapore last year. That same event saw Singapore's Royce Chai hit the Top 8. Finally Tan has a chance for revenge. Chai enjoys a bit of celebrity himself, known as "The Tourist" after he spent Worlds taking photos of himself with his opponents.

Tan leapt to the offensive immediately. [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) stole [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer), leaving [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) behind. He then suited up with [Ghostly Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings) and started serving. [Nantuko Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Disciple) gave Chai pause, but he wanted that [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) back. Down came the Desire, and Tan pitched to rescue it. When the Fiend came back, it stole Chai's best hope: [Narcissism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcissism).

Chai sighed and made the Archer. Tan overtrumped with [Grotesque Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grotesque+Hybrid). Chai was backed into a corner. He was forced to use and reuse his [Acorn Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest) to make Tan think he was planning something. Tan dropped him to six with the Hybrid. Chai counterattacked, but Tan still stood at fifteen. He tried a [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout) to block, but [Seton's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Desire) on the Fiend meant he was taking too much damage, too fast. He soon succumbed.

Tan 1 - Chai 0

Chai kicked off the second with [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). It hit twice, then fell to [Afflict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict). He was clearly short on offense, as he brought it back with [Morgue Theft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morgue+Theft). Tan meanwhile got his [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) on, and answered [Narcissism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcissism) by tapping out for [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat) and [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). He was already at eleven. He had to play it safe.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkl02/a977.jpg)Chai put [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) on the dog. Tan kept it alive for a turn with a pitch. Then he added [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin) to his team. [Stupefying Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch) took away [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat)'s regeneration, but again Tan pitched to keep it active for a turn. Chai added [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear), trying to keep up.

Tan continued to outstrip him. [Cartographer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer) and [Hydromorph Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Guardian) made sure he'd have ample defenders. [Zombie Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Assassin) ate the Rootwalla after Chai pitched to save it. Tan hit back, and added [Hydromorph Gull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Gull) to his team. Chai forced him to blow up his Guardian to stop a Demise on it.

Here Chai made a mistake. He could have put [Ghostly Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings) on the Gull and pitched a card to bounce it. Then the way would be clear for his [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear). He could then sacrifice [Narcissism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcissism), getting Threshold, then use his [Centaur Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Garden) for the win. Instead he attacked with the Bear, and discarded both cards to kill the Gull and hit threshold.

Tan made him sad with a [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher). Chai topdecked [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) to stay in the game. Attacking was an impossibility for Tan. He reused [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) to find more attackers. [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) forced out [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush), then Tan used [Cultural Exchange](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultural+Exchange) to take the token and Archer, giving up his Fiend and [Cartographer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartographer).

Time was called. Both players hadn't noticed their overly cautious pace of play. Chai tried a last desperate attack to win the game and earn a draw, but Tan blunted it easily. He was thus wide open, and Tan was able to win handily.

**Final Result:** Michael Tan defeats Royce Chai 2-0
