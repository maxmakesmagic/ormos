Billy Moreno vs. Ben Zoz
------------------------


Nebraskan Ben Zoz is on an 8-0-1 run at US Nationals. His *Coldsnap* draft deck is an Illusion-packed evasion-fest, sporting five [Krovikan Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Mist)s and a [Phobian Phantasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phobian+Phantasm) for the illusionary beatdown, and a not-to-be-forgotten pair of [Blizzard Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blizzard+Specter)s and other evasive men. 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat06/Round10_FM.jpg)*Moreno, left, and Zoz drafted very different decks.*
In his way is Billy Moreno, the Austin-Texas-by-way-of-New-York contender who's at 7-2 right now. Moreno wields a green-red-black concoction full of XXL ground-pounders such as [Aurochs Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurochs+Herd)s and [Deepfire Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepfire+Elemental), with a set of [Martyr of Ashes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Ashes) working overtime to clear the way.


### Game 1


Moreno rolled a pair of brand-new shiny purple dice he bought from the Wizards retail booth, and won the roll. He led out with a [Boreal Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Centaur). Zoz had [Krovikan Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Mist) to start plinking back. Moreno made [Martyr of Ashes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Ashes) with mana up, but the Mist sailed steadily over the top.


When Zoz tapped out for [Zombie Musher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Musher), Moreno knew the Musher could get in the way of his earthborn fatties, so he swung in with both the Martyr and the Centaur hoping for some creature combat.


Zoz: "How many cards do you have?"  

Moreno: "Six."  

Zoz: "No blocks."


Zoz took the damage, but on his turn aimed a [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) at the efficient Centaur. Zoz had not played a snow-covered land, so in response, Moreno activated Martyr, revealing [Surging Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surging+Flame), [Deepfire Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepfire+Elemental) and another red card, killing the Musher. Zoz dropped a [Snow-Covered Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snow-Covered+Swamp) morosely once the stack cleared, but at least Moreno's board was clear too. [Krovikan Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Mist) continued its march to lethal damage one ping at a time.


Zoz followed up with a [Disciple of Tevesh Szat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Tevesh+Szat), which promptly ate Moreno's [Surging Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surging+Flame), with no love on the ripple for the remaining Mist.


Zoz went into illusion overdrive with [Phobian Phantasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phobian+Phantasm) and then a second [Krovikan Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Mist) the next turn, crashing into Moreno's life total while a meek [Boreal Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Druid) watched them sail overhead. Moreno made a race of it with a hasted [Thermopod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermopod), but even a [Resize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resize) in hand couldn't add up to a victory for Moreno.


Moreno 0 - Zoz 1


### Game 2


Moreno started with a mulligan on the play, and then flatly declared a mulligan to five. Zoz kept, proving, of course, that Hymn to Tourach is overcosted at ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif).


Moreno opened with good mana in [Tresserhorn Sinks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tresserhorn+Sinks) and three basic lands in his colors, but his turn-four [Simian Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Brawler) met [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). Zoz got the illusion party started and began plinking away with another early [Krovikan Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Mist).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat06/Round10_Zoz.jpg)Moreno only had [Martyr of Spores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Spores), which one swing later saw the business end of Zoz's [Disciple of Tevesh Szat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Tevesh+Szat) while Moreno tapped out for [Thermopod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermopod). The [Thermopod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermopod) came down with no haste, and just felt slow as Zoz made another [Krovikan Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Mist) and swung for 2. Moreno crashed in with the [Thermopod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermopod), and tried for [Ohran Yeti](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ohran+Yeti), but Zoz used [Disciple of Tevesh Szat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Tevesh+Szat)'s second ability to blow it away.


Zoz untapped into a third [Krovikan Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Mist) and swung for 6. Facing 9 points of flying damage next turn on depleted resources, Moreno's answer was to scoop them up.


Moreno 0 - Zoz 2


Zoz de-sleeved his [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), improving to 9-0-1 on the tournament. Moreno fell to 7-3.
