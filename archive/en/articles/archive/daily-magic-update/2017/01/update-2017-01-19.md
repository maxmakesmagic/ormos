The January 19, 2017 Update
===========================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on January 18, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by math, which, yes, means there is a Frank Karsten article on tap for you.


Today's Must
============


1. [Revolt and Improvise: The Math and the Brews](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/revolt-and-improvise-the-math-and-the-brews/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Be still my beating heart, this article has a probability graph. Like many Karsten articles, this one gets kind of mathy, but what's really valuable is the analysis that comes from that math. How likely are you to be able to trigger revolt on turn two or three in Standard, and what does that mean for building your deck? How reliably can improvise reduce the cost of important spells to a point where it's effective? Answering all of these questions leads Karsten to a four-color aggressive deck and a blue-black improvise list. Through math.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Aether Revolt* with Shawn Main](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

*Aether Revolt* is full of cool, powerful, and fun Commander cards, and the Commanderin' crew has Shawn Main—an R&D designer—on the show to talk about a number of those cool, powerful, fun cards.


1. [*Aether Revolt* Draft Archetypes: Allied Colors](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/aether-revolt-draft-archetypes-allied-colors/) | ChannelFireball | Neal Oliver

With *Aether Revolt* releasing this weekend, I foresee a lot of drafts coming everyone's way. Might as well come prepared, as Oliver works through the archetypes for the allied part of the set.


1. [Revolting for a Better Future](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/simon-nielsen/revolting-for-a-better-future) | MTGMint Card | Simon Nielsen

Nielsen does something rare in the world of *Magic* pros—he shares his initial testing for [Pro Tour *Aether* *Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptaer). The Jund Zoo list in particular looks quite interesting.


1. [What We Learned: World Champions Review *Aether Revolt*—Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOhqya8L4c8) | TCGPlayer | Ryan Gomez and Jon Corpora

Right now, TCGPlayer is running a World Champions review of *Aether Revolt* featuring, naturally, two World Champions—Brian Braun-Duin and Seth Manfield. Then, on top of that, they have a video series that summarizes the highlights of those articles. Today's version, seen below, covers the black cards of *Aether Revolt*. Shocker, [Fatal Push](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push) gets high marks.

1. [Standard Brewing Ideas from the Prerelease](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34415_Standard-Brewing-Ideas-From-The-Prerelease.html) | StarCityGames.com | Chris Lansdell

Lansdell takes what he saw at the *Aether Revolt* Prerelease and uses that experience to dig up some powerful cards for Standard that might not be getting as much press as they should be. It's a whale of an article, efficiently rallying his expertise for you to mimic.


1. [Let's Get Down to Business](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34413_Lets-Get-Down-To-Business.html) | StarCityGames.com | Emma Handy

Ahead of the release of *Aether Revolt* and the dawn of a new Standard (reminder: the bans go into effect tomorrow), Handy writes about the cards that might give you a hint of what your opponent is doing—even if their deck is something completely new.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [*Aether Revolt* Prerelease Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTx0-H-UDMI) | MTG: Young Mage

*Magic*'s youngest YouTuber talks all about his Prerelease experience where he played a blue-green deck, which he proudly shows off, and tells all about how he got 5th place. It's adorable, it's fun, it's certainly worth watching.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Were The Bans Good For Magic?<https://t.co/DqS5CNDLJr>
> 
> 
>  — Owen Turtenwald (@OwenTweetenwald) [January 19, 2017](https://twitter.com/OwenTweetenwald/status/821978279234060289)

One of the best players in the world talks in video form about the bans in Standard and Modern. He gives lengthy thoughts on each card, explaining why they all needed to go.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Jeskai Panharmonicon](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/theres-more-than-one-way-to-copy-a-cat/) | ChannelFireball | Josh Silvestri

And the winner for "Deck I'll Most Likely Be Playing" goes to Jeskai [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon). Sure, you've got the copycat combo ([Saheeli Rai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) and [Felidar Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian)), but you've also got [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) which, while not instantly game-winning, is infinitely more satisfying.


But wait, there's more! The deck has three total infinite combos in it. The second is the one that already existed in the deck—[Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon), [Eldrazi Displacer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer), and [Drowner of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope). The third is pretty funny, as [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) and two [Felidar Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian)s adds up to infinite blinks (each Guardian gets two blink triggers, one of which blinks the other Guardian the other of which blinks anything else. The second Guardian leaves and comes back and you do it all again as long as you'd like). That can give you unlimited mana by blinking a land or any number of unlimited triggers for any other permanent you have sitting around.


The deck is a touch light on two-drops, so I might look back at a (now much weaker) [Glint-Nest Crane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Nest+Crane) or [Declaration in Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone). When your deck is all value and several game-winning combos, [Declaration in Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone)'s drawback rarely matters all that much.


But however you go about it, you've now got a number of ways to copy a Cat (joke courtesy the title of the very article I'm pointing you toward).
