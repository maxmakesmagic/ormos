The capital and largest city in the Netherlands, Amsterdam began as a small fishing village but later grew into one of the most important ports in the world. The historic canals criss-cross the city in four concentric circles, combining to form more than 100 kilometers of waterways with 1,500 bridges. Amsterdam receives more than 3.5 million tourists annually.


Amsterdam is home to numerous museums, including the Rijksmuseum, which features many of Rembrandt's famous works. Van Gogh's short residence in Amsterdam is marked by a museum showcasing his early work. The Stedelijk Museum located next to the Van Gogh museum is the city's largest display of modern art. Amsterdam also features a rich architectural heritage and a vibrant nightlife.
