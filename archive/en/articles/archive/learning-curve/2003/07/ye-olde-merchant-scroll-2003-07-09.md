The people that brought you Aysen Highway and Hazdurh the Abbot proudly present…

…a good card. Ahhhhh… *Homelands*.

![Merchant Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Merchant+Scroll)The follow-up expansion to *Ice Age* is not exactly known for its contributions to the tournament **Magic**. When the very first Pro Tour featured a format that required competitors to play with five cards from each Standard legal set-back when the format was called Type 2-most players opted for four [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows) and a dead card in the sideboard or occasionally a [Wizard's School](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard%27s+School). [Spectral Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Bears) had their day in the sun and I did hear about mtg.com's own Mike Flores recently losing a game of Mental Magic to Internet curmudgeon Jonathan Becker thanks to [Jinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinx) but let's face it, *Homelands* was not **Magic**'s zenith.Today, if you were cracking *Homelands* packs, [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) is about the best you can hope to bust open-and it was a common. Sure there was [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir), [Autumn Willow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn+Willow), and [Ihsan's Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ihsan%27s+Shade) but I can get more in trade for the common [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) than any of those three rares. Especially now that it is being reprinted in the *Core Set*. The card has always been one of the most powerful tutors in the game. Unlike *Mirage* block's [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), [Mystical Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor), [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) and [Worldly Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Tutor), [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) puts the card you find directly into your hand without any card disadvantage.

In fact, the card is very similar to [Demonic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor) in both converted casting cost and function, although [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) comes with more limitations-not only do you have to retrieve a blue card but it must be an instant. [Demonic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor) can get you a land, a [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), [Mind Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Twist) - I guess that's why one is restricted in the Vintage format and the other isn't. Despite that, [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) is already a staple card in the Vintage format used almost exclusively to fetch [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) - and occasionally [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) or [Mana Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain) but only if the Ancestral has already been used or is in hand.

I don't believe it will have a huge impact on Standard until after the *Odyssey* Block rotates out and takes [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) with it. For one mana more but at instant speed, [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) is going to remain the blue tutor of choice for Standard play. There is even some question as to whether or not Scroll will see much play with [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) and [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) going out the revolving door while the Scroll was coming in. Initially I was in this camp but have since changed my tune. I think that there will be enough narrow counters in the format that [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) will find some use -- I particularly like it with [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle).

The format that will truly be affected by the reprint of the Scroll is Extended - where the card has really shined in the past. Until the most recent Extended rotation, [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) was a fixture in Extended combo decks including High Tide, Necro Donate and just about any deck that featured the [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) combo.

Killing someone with [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius)? Why play with four when you can have eight (although most decks rarely have room or need for a full suite of [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll)s)?

Frantically searching for [Frantic Search](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search)? Calm down, [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) means you have more than four - you'll find it.

Because the [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) puts the card directly into your hand it functioned as additional copies of each of the combo pieces that happened to be blue instants. With a [Sapphire Medallion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion) in play a player could [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) for [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) and cast the AK for three cards - for only four mana. Keep in mind that whole sequence is available in Extended come September 1st.

![Chain Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chain+Stasis)One of my favorite pre-rotation Extended decks used [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) - perhaps the best card from Homelands -- and perhaps the worst card from the same set - [Chain Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis). Chain allows you to tap or untap target creature. Then its controller can pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) to choose a new target for a copy of the spell. A few years back I was sitting around with a group of friends looking through one guy's trade binder. Somehow he had accumulated well over a dozen copies of [Chain Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis) - mostly as throw-ins on convoluted trades - and he could not get rid of them. We set out to build a deck that would utilize [Chain Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis) to inspire local players to trade for the ones lying fallow in his book.Since the deck revolved around getting infinite mana with a [Chain Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis) you had to ensure that you drew one or the deck would fizzle. We eventually stumbled onto [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) -- it was the first time I had ever included [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) in a deck and the resulting deck will always have a special place in my heart.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Treetop+Village)

















The idea behind the deck is to get an [Overgrowth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrowth) and a [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) on a [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) - it can't be one with summoning sickness-and animate your man-land floating at least one blue mana. With the blue mana you can cast [Chain Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis) to untap your Village. Once that resolves you can tap your Village - this is why it can't have summoning sickness - for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) and pay to put a copy of the spell on the stack targeting your same [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). You can repeat this over and over netting a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) each time making - what my judge type friends like to call an arbitrarily large amount of mana. With that mana you can use [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) to finish off your opponent. If you don't have the Stroke you can always find it with [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll).

You can also do the trick with a [Faerie Conclave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) or even one of your basic lands. The Animate Lands provide protection from [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s and [Dust Bowl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Bowl) as well as an additional three ways to "make a man"-land. [Chain Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis) is no longer legal in Extended so if you want to update the deck it would have to be in a casual format or in an older one like Vintage or Type 1.5. If you do try to use [Chain Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Stasis) it also works quite well with the [Krosan Restorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Restorer) - although you need a [Wild Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Growth)-type card or a [Mana Flare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Flare)-ish enchantment. It also works with our old friend the [Wirewood Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler).

![Stroke of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stroke+of+Genius)I have been toying around with an Extended deck for the post 8th environment that uses [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll). The deck is not quite there yet. It does win but not consistently enough for my tastes. I am definitely open to suggestions and will do a follow up if there is any real progress on the deck. It is based on two older decks - High Tide and Dark Tide with a dash of Tight Sight for taste. The former used the eponymous spell [High Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide) and the untap cards from *Urza's Saga* to generate huge amounts of mana and kill the opponent with [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius).When [High Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide) and all of *Fallen Empires* left Extended a few rotations ago it was replaced with a less successful two color version that used [Bubbling Muck](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bubbling+Muck). Here I tried to combine the mana production of the [Bubbling Muck](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bubbling+Muck) with the ability to play free spells off of [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). The goal is to kill your opponent with a [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) - remember X = 0 when the spell is played off of a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) so you have to get one in hand to go off successfully. There is also a [Brain Freeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) which can be played for free off of the [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire).
