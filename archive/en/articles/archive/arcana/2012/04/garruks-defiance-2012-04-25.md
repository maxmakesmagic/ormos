Here's Wild Defiance from *Avacyn Restored*.

Obviously, that's Garruk in the background. Specifically, it's [Garruk, the Veil-Cursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+the+Veil-Cursed). Compare that image to the one on the cursed Garruk:

But there's another surprise in store. That wolf in the foreground looks a little strange, right? Even looking past the head spikes, it's maybe a little more evil than your run-of-the-mill wolves? Here's what the *Innistrad* black Wolf token looked like.
