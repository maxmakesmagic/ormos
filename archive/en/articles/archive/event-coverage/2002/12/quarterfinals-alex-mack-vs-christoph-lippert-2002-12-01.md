833 competitors came to Reims. Once the dust of 15 rounds of Swiss settles only 8 competitors remain. Christophe Lippert of Germany is no stranger to GP top 8's. He's running a crazy 3-color "good stuff" deck utilizing some of the best black, blue and white cards the format can offer. His opponent, Alex Mack, is running Sligh, a choice that paid off for a lot of players this tournament.

![Blistering Firecat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blistering+Firecat)Lippert won the die roll and opted to go first. He led with a [Polluted Mire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Mire), sacrificing it immediately for a swamp and then [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ing his opponent. Mack's hand was less than optimal, the only creature a [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat), but he did have a Port and [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) to attack the weak mana base in Lippert's deck. The [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took one of the two [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer)s in Mack's hand.Mack found a [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) while Lippert used another [Polluted Mire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Mire) and [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed. By turn 3 he had all three colors in basic lands and dropped a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) naming the [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) in Mack's hand.

Mack went after the plains with a Port only for Lippert to dig another one out with a [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) and summon a [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx).

The [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)cat screamed in along with the Fanatic. Lippert checked the way was clear with [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), then dropped a [Phyrexian Negator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator) to try and end the game quickly. Mack had only a [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) and two mountains in hand and needed to find an answer. He laid a [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) and nipped off the [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx) with a fanatic.

Lippert also had a good turn, Vindicating the [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) and dropping another [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx). Mack was able to activate the scroll and take out the [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) in response.

He topdecked another Scroll and the situation got very interesting.

Mack was on 9, Lippert on 4. An attack dropped Mack to 5, but worse, Lippert morphed a creature onto the board. This would be able to block Mack's [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup). Mack needed to draw a burn spell so he could activate the scroll and finish Lippert off.

He didn't and the Negator took the first game.

Lippert 1-0 Mack

Mack started better in Game 2 as a Goblin Cadet entered play on turn and was followed by a Lavamancer on turn two. Lippert didn't do anything until his turn 3 when he dropped an [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) to deal with the [Goblin Cadets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Cadets).

A second [Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer) to the dome and a [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) hitting the table put Lippert far behind in the damage race. A second [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) to take care of Lavamancers seemed late, especially as Mack laid a second Scroll. Mack was still struggling to unload his hand, and more particularly find a 4th land for two [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat)s. It didn't matter as he dropped his hand to just those two cards and a Scroll finished Lippert off.

Lippert 1-1 Mack

For the decider both players had tough decisions on their hands. Lippert [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed on turn 1 and saw Mack had kept a 1 sac land hand. That one land could cast all but two of his spells so it wasn't terrible. Mack fetched his mountain and led with a [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer).

![Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vindicate)Lippert dropped a [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass), not the best land to have in the matchup and summoned a [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx). Mack found a second land, Lavamancered the Lynx and summoned a [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup).Lippert's draw hadn't panned out for him at all as a third land still hadn't arrived by turn 3. His Sergeant died to a Fanatic and even when the third land, a [Caves of Koilos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos) appeared, he had to use it to [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) a [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup).

Lippert made a morph guy, a [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder), that died immediately to Lavamancer. A second [Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer) went to Lippert's Dome.

The German was critically low on life. He untapped, looked for an answer and none was forthcoming.

**Final Result:** Alex Mack beat Christoph Lippert 2-1
