Face the Hydra Challenge
* **Preliminaries Begin:** October 24
* **Preliminaries End:** October 28
* **Finals:** October 30 through November 6  

 times arranged with each of five champions


Great monsters stir in the world of Theros, and one of the mightiest among them is the many-headed horror, the Hydra. Heroes who have faced the beast are few, and far fewer remain who still draw breath and are willing to tell of it.


Now it is your turn. The call to glory has been issued, and the Hero's Path Standard format awaits. Will you accept and face the Hydra to stand among heroes?


Hero's Path Standard Format and Your Path to the Hydra
------------------------------------------------------


*Theros*  introduces the new Hero's Path Standard format to **Magic Online**. To build your Hero's Path Standard deck, collect Hero Avatars during *Theros*  Prerelease and Release events and use up to two unique Hero Avatars in your Standard-legal deck. If you are using the Wide Beta Client, select the Hero's Path format when building a new deck. Hero Avatars do not count toward your 60-card deck minimum, so your submitted deck may be 61 or more cards.


During play you will see Hero Avatars on the battlefield in the Wide Beta Client, and in the current client they will appear in the command zone window. You can activate these to take advantage of their effects, but they cannot be interacted with as permanents.


### **Hero Avatars and Your Path to the Hydra**


[Your path to the Hydra begins during Prerelease](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-theros-prerelease-and-release-events-2013-09-16-0). Pick up your Hero's Path from the **Magic Online**  Store and participate in Prerelease events to acquire one of five Hero Avatars and a promo card. [Read the September 16 article](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-theros-prerelease-and-release-events-2013-09-16-0) for Prerelease and Release Event schedules.


As part of your Hero's Path choice, you will receive one of these five Prerelease Hero Avatars that you can use during the Face the Hydra Challenge:





|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **The Protector**: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn. | **The Philosopher**, : Tap target creature. | **The Avenger**, : Target creature you control gains deathtouch until end of turn. |



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| **The Warrior**: Target creature you control gains haste until end of turn. | **The Hunter**: Target creature you control gets +1/+1 until end of turn. |


[Your path continues during Release events](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-theros-prerelease-and-release-events-2013-09-16-0) beginning October 7 where you can add another Hero Avatar to your collection, The Harvester.



**The Harvester**  

Release Avatar  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/mana_tap.png): Draw a card, then discard a card.
 

Then, starting October 24, bring your Hero's Path Standard-legal deck to one of five the five Face the Hydra Challenge Preliminaries which are scheduled through October 28. Here you will earn another Hero Avatar for your collection, The Slayer.



**The Slayer**  

Face the Hydra Challenge Avatar  

You start the game with an additional 7 life.
 

Five heroes will emerge from the preliminaries as the chosen champions, battle-hardened and ready to face the ultimate opponent in the Finals: the Hydra. Members of the R&D team will assume the form of the terrifying Hydra, wielding a powerful Hydra-themed deck and bent on the destruction of all foolhardy heroes! Select events from the Face the Hydra Challenge Finals will be streamed live on our [**Magic**  Twitch.tv channel](/en/events/coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93amsterdam-standard-qualifier-season-top-8-decklists).




The R&D Hydra team:



* Ryan Spain
* Jon Loucks
* Dave Guskin
* Sam Stoddard
* Dave Humpherys

Those five champions will earn the honor of facing the Hydra. If the majority of champions win against their Hydra opponent, all **Magic Online**  players who logged in during the period from October 4 and November 6 will receive the the Hydra avatar.


Face the Hydra Challenge | October 24 - November 6
--------------------------------------------------


There will be five events October 24 through October 28, 2013, each with a single champion. Each champion will advance to the Face the Hydra Challenge Finals held between October 30 and November 6 at a time to be arranged with the champion.


If at least three of the five champions are victorious over their Hydra opponents during the Face the Hydra Challenge Finals, each champion will receive the Hydra avatar, and all **Magic Online**  players who logged in during the period from October 4 through November 6 will also receive the Hydra avatar!
