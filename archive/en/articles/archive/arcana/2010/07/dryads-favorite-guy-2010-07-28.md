The ***Magic** 2011* card [Dryad's Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad%27s+Favor) depicts one of **Magic**'s mysterious, tree-dwelling dryads granting a worthy human the ability to pass through the woods with supernatural ease—to "walk the forest," if you will.

But what sort of person might earn the favor of the dryads, and allowed such free run of the forest? It would probably be someone who was already be familiar with the deep woods, a ranger of the woodlands who had already proven his or her love of the forest.

Come to think of it .... That guy looks familiar, doesn't he? Could that be ...?

It is! That's ***Magic** 2010*'s [Borderland Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger), also illustrated by Jesper Ejsing!
