### Eric Froehlich (Vampires) vs. Guillaume Matignon (Blue-Black Control)

Guillaume Matignon entered the Top 8 of the 2010 World Championship with a chance to be ****Magic**: The Gathering** Player of the Year. If he won the whole thing, then the 25 Pro Points he'd receive, along with the 3 for his French National Team's sixth-place finish, would put him into a tie with the United States's Brad Nelson. That would result in a playoff at Pro Tourâ€“Paris, but Matignon first had to fight through a power-packed Top 8.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/qf1_froehlich_matignon.jpg)*France's Guillaume Matignon and America's Eric Froehlich.*Eric Froehlich has been on the Pro Tour seemingly forever, and has an array of previous Grand Prix and Pro Tour Top 8s to his name. More relevantly for this matchup, he went 6-0 in the Standard portion of this year's Worlds, while Matignon managed just a 3-3 record. Matignon went undefeated in *Scars of Mirrodin* Draft (6-0) and Extended (4-0-2), but those are not the format for the Top 8.

**Game 1**

On paper, Froehlich's Vampire deck is much faster than Matignon's Blue-Black Control, and it looks like the American's cheap creatures ought to roar out of the gate fast and furious. But Matignon started quickly with an opportune [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), hitting a [Vampire Lacerator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator). Then he used [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) to turn Froehlich's [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) into an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed a [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage), and it appeared that he had successfully stopped any chance of an early rush of Vampires. The first board-changing event was Matignon's [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), which Froehlich answered with a second [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) (this one resolved).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/qf1_matignon.jpg)*Matignon puts on his game face, or possibly his supervillain face.*The battle for card advantage (and card *quality* advantage) was on. Matignon cast a [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed with Jace before locking down a [Blackcleave Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs) with a second [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). Froehlich's [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) dinged him for 3 life as he drew another copy of [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) itself. Undeterred, he cast it, still stuck on three lands (two of which had been turned into [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s), but at least drawing a lot of cards each turn.

Matignon was having no mana problems and cast a [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). Froehlich's [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage)s pushed him down to 14, and he thought about his situation.

Froehlich conceded, and they moved on to the second game.

Matignon 1, Froehlich 0

In the between-game chat, Froehlich described his experience coming back to ****Magic**** after a time away from the game. "Before I came back, everyone told me 'They're all bad, don't worry about it." How could they be bad? There's been MODO for ten years!" (That's an old-timey word for ****Magic** Online**.)

**Game 2**

Froehlich started much better this time, with two [Blackcleave Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs) giving him an unobstructed path to a [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir). The Gatekeeper got [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure)d, but the [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) was still a viable attacker.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/qf1_froehlich.jpg)*Point of interest: 'Froehlich' means 'cheerful' in German. Is Froehlich froehlich? You be the judge.*Because his lands this game were heavy on the [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit)s (which enter the battlefield tapped), Matignon's [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) was delayed until turn three, and he used it to deal with Froehlich's [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn). Froehlich drew and cast another one when Matignon was at 14. The [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) Matignon used to turn off a [Lavaclaw Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches) proved to be less impressive when his opponent had three other lands to deal with.

Matignon cast a [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), which fell victim to a [Feast of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feast+of+Blood). Froehlich's [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) dealth with the threat of a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), and Matignon answered with a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) of his own to get rid of a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). But he wasn't pleased to see the [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) in Froehlich's hand, and had to trade a Zombie token to stop the [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) from killing him. The presence of the [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) meant that the [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)'s death still stole 2 of Matignon's life, bringing him to 6. When his last card (a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)) was [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed away, Matignon conceded the game.

Matignon 1, Froehlich 1

**Game 3**

Matignon took a mulligan and started with a [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit). Froehlich answered witha [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats), which he's playing strictly for its [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)-acquiring ability. Matignon started in improving his draws with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) on turn two.

Froehlich's [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir) got [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure)d, and his [Blackcleave Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs) got [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas)-ed. He was still able to cast [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage). Matignon went with [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). The [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) revealed another [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage), and both players were clearly going to be drawing like Pros.

Froehlich [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed away a [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), leaving a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) in Matignon's hand. [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) made the scene and Matignon put his head in his hands as he considered his situation. He used [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) to send the [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) back to Froehlich's hand, and did not appear thrilled when Froehlich's [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) revealed a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/qf1_matignon2.jpg)*In Canada, allegedly, you put your finger under nose (and a hand on your head) to say 'Not it.' (It's disguising yourself, see?) But Matignon's French, so your guess is as good as ours.*Froehlich deliberately cast the [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) into the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) that he knew about, and got the expected result, which was that both the Nighthawk and the Leak were gone. Matignon Jace-[Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed and cast a [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) for some breathing room. Froehlich was at 15, thanks to the [Marsh Flats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats) and his own [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage). He cast [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) on one of the Zombie tokens and untapped.

Instead of dealing with the [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) directly, Froehlich cast [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) and [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) before passing the turn. The Highborn got [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure)d, and Matignon attacked with the [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), a Zombie, and [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit). Froehlich blocked the [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) with [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), but it got [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure)d before it could deal damage. He fell to 10 life, had no creatures, and conceded.

Matignon 2, Froehlich 1

**Game 4**

Froehlich went first and started strong with a [Pulse Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker). Matignon [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed and went down to 18 life on the attack. Froehlich added a second [Pulse Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker) to the mix (but not a land on his second turn), and Matignon cast a [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) to threaten the one-mana army.

Froehlich attacked Matignon down to 16 and cast [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) to replace the doomed [Pulse Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker)s. They did indeed die, but Matignon was soon down to 12 life. Froehlich [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed away a [Consume the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek), and Matignon [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor)ed the [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) back to Froehlich's hand.

Froehlich, still stuck on two land, replayed the [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast). Matignon, at four land, used Jace to [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) up some answers. After putting cards back on the top of his library, he used [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) to move them to the bottom, and played a fifth land.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/qf1_froehlich_matignon2.jpg)*Froehlich and Matignon trade blows.*Froehlich got a third land and introduced [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir), kicked to destroy the [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle). But Matignon had a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and Froehlich slumped in his chair.

Matignon cruelly bounced the [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and cast [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). His [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle), seeing no opposition, attacked for one, putting Froehlich at 19.

Froehlich's [Vampire Nighthawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) got bounced by Jace, removing the last loyalty counter at last. An all-out attack followed by a second [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) made Froehlich extend a hand in congratulations.

Guillaume Matignon defeats Eric Froehlich 3-1 and advances to the Semifinals!
