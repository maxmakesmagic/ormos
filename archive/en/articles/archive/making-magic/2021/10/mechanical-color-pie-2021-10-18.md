Mechanical Color Pie 2021

By Mark Rosewater




 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






In 2017, I wrote an article called [Mechanical Color Pie 2017](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/mechanical-color-pie-2017-2017-06-05) where I listed in detail what effects were in each color. I promised that from time to time I would update this article. Today, I'm doing just that. You can see the [list of changes with explanations](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/mechanical-color-pie-2021-changes-2021-10-18) in the companion article.


Here are a few caveats before we get to the revamped color pie:


1. This mechanical color pie represents where the color pie currently is today, October 18, 2021. It's a snapshot in time. The color pie will continue to evolve and change as it's always done. This means while most of this will be true in the future, not everything will be, but I do promise to continue updating this article when enough has shifted.
2. I work in the future (two-plus years), so while I'm going to try to communicate where the color pie is in the present, a little future might sneak through.
3. What I'm writing here is the default center, but the needs of each set will shift the color pie a little, bending it in ways that reinforce the needs of that set.
4. We are constantly experimenting with things, so a few of the things I talk about today might not stick.
5. Unlike last time, this time I got the Council of Colors to help me, so I hope this version is even more thorough than the last version, but as we're all human, I'm sure there are things we forgot.

That said, let's explore the color pie.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/MM20161114_Wheel.png)


To begin, we need to start by laying down some terminology:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/WUBRG_A.png)


* **Primary** – This is the color (or colors) the ability is seen in most. That means it shows up in the highest volume and usually at the lowest rarity that the type of effects get used at. The primary color will almost always get this effect in a set if it's an ability we do every set. It also tends to be the color that most often pushes the power level, if it's an effect we push the power level on. There's a wide range on what primary means, because different types of effects exist at different levels. A card secondary in flying can show up way more than a card primary in taking extra turns, for instance, because we have so many more flying cards than extra-turn cards.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/WUBRG_B.png)


* **Secondary** – This is the color (or colors) that an ability shows up in on a somewhat regular basis, but not as often as the primary and not always in as low of rarity as the primary. If the effect is something we do a lot of, the secondary color will usually get the ability in most sets. Sometimes a secondary color will have restrictions. For instance, red is secondary in flying, but only on Dragons and Phoenixes.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/WUBRG_C.png)


* **Tertiary** – This is the color (or colors) that gets the ability occasionally. It's not every set. For some abilities, we could go years without seeing a tertiary color using it. Tertiary colors can often come with rules, meaning it's a very narrow subset that makes use of the mechanic. For example, black is tertiary in first strike and gets it primarily on Knights, most often when paired against a mirrored white Knight.

While there's always a primary color, there's not always a secondary or tertiary color. Also, more than one color can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. Cards that grant an ability to others usually are primary in that ability, occasionally secondary, and almost never tertiary. Multicolor cards, when trying to capture the feel of a color, will use primary and secondary abilities but (almost) never tertiary. For example, white is tertiary in reach. We wouldn't make a white-black card (black doesn't have reach) wherein the creature is "getting" reach from its white half.


I want to stress one more time that primary, secondary, and tertiary are relative to how often an effect is used. Things that are secondary in a color, for example, may be far more prevalent in that color than things that are primary if the items in question occur at a higher frequency.


* **N** – "N" represents a natural number (1 or greater). +N/+0, for instance, means pumping a creature for an undefined amount. When defining abilities with numbers, we usually use N to cover all cases. If N appears multiple times within one mechanic (+N/+N, for example), N can represent different numbers.
* **Spells** – For the purpose of today's discussion, when I say "spells," I am referring to instants and sorceries.

I'm now going to list the mechanical color pie, separating the primary, secondary, and tertiary abilities for each color. Afterward, I'll go through all the abilities in alphabetical order, explaining why an ability is in that color and what the limitations on it may be. You can [jump to the alphabetical list of all abilities and explanations](#colorpiedetails).

All Abilities with Explanations
===============================


I've included a greater explanation of the limitations of each ability below, as well as which colors it can appear in, so you can see how the colors share abilities.




A–E
---






**Animating artifacts (Target/all non-creature artifact(s) you control becomes an artifact creature.)**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Green


Blue is the color most likely to turn a non-creature artifact into an artifact creature. Green is second most likely to do it.




---

**Animating Enchantments (Target/all non-aura enchantment(s) you control becomes an enchantment creature.)**


Primary: White  

 Secondary: Blue


White is the color that animates other enchantments. Blue has enchantments that under certain conditions can become animated.




---

**Animating lands (Target land becomes an N/N creature until end of turn.)**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Red  

 Tertiary: White, blue, and black


Green, as the color connected most closely to lands and creatures, is the color most likely to turn lands into creatures—usually still keeping them lands. When we do this, we often grant the land haste to avoid having to worry if it was the one you played this turn (which would have summoning sickness). Red uses this ability a little playing into its one-shot damage cards that come through attacking. All the colors have dipped their toe into this area, but it's infrequent and usually only involves animating their own basic land type and is most often done in cycles.




---

**Artifact destruction**


Primary: Red and green  

 Secondary: White


Red and green usually have one artifact destruction card in common, although green's is usually also a spell that destroy both artifacts and enchantments. (See enchantment destruction.) White is starting to get more artifact destruction at common and is usually also able to destroy enchantments.




---

**[Banisher Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest)–like effect (When this card enters the battlefield, exile target creature/permanent until this card leaves play.)**


Primary: White


This is one of white's most efficient answers, especially in Limited. It is usually used on creatures but sometimes hits other permanents. The effect is always on a permanent, usually a creature or enchantment.




---

**Basic land counting (Doing an effect equal to the number of basic lands of a certain type you control.)**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Black and green  

 Tertiary: White and blue


All colors have access to this, but red does it most, followed by black and green.




---

**"Bite" (Target creature deals damage to equal to its power to another target creature.)**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Red


This used to just be a red ability, but we realized that green needed it more, as green's creature removal has to be tied to creatures and red had plenty of other direct-damage spells. So red now does this less often.




---

**Return to library (Put a creature/permanent on top of its owner's library or some number of cards down.)**


Primary: Blue


Blue does this as an upgraded version of returning to hand. Blue will sometimes put the card a few cards down into the library and sometimes shuffles it into a small pile on top. White used to also do this, but it has been removed from white.




---

**Bring back creatures/permanents that went to the graveyard this turn**


Primary: White


White, the color of mercy, is the color that saves things the turn they are destroyed.




---

**Can't be attacked (Creatures can't attack you.)**


Primary: White


We don't do this often, but this effect keeps you from either being attacked for a turn or as long as a specific permanent is on the battlefield.




---

**Can't be blocked**


Primary: Blue


We tried to keyword this ability only to discover that there are so many variations on it that we couldn't. Instead, we changed from "unblockable" to "can't be blocked" to avoid players thinking it was a keyword. (It matters occasionally.) Blue has creatures with this ability *and* grants it through spells and Auras.




---

**Can't be countered**


Primary: Red and green  

 Secondary: Blue


Red tends to have spells that can't be countered while green tends to have creatures that can't be countered. When blue does "can't be countered," which is less often, it's usually a more control-oriented card.




---

**Can't block**


Primary: Black and red


For a long time we separated black from red by making black have the "can't block" drawback on its creatures and red have the "must attack" drawback on its creatures. Time has shown that the "can't block" drawback leads to better gameplay, so we've started using it on red as much as black.




---

**Can't lose the game and opponent can't win**


Primary: White


This is a defensive ability, and thus shows up in white.




---

**Can't win the game and opponent can't lose**


Primary: Black


This ability is used as a drawback in black.




---

**Card draw**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Black and green  

 Tertiary: White and red


Blue is best at card drawing. It has the most of it and no restrictions. Black's card drawing must involve paying some other cost, most often life but sometimes sacrificing permanents. Green's card draw is tied to creatures. In the past, we've also connected it to land, but that ended up making green card draw a little too much like blue, so we've pulled back from that. All colors get cantrips (spells that draw you a single card). Blue gets the best cantrip spells, white gets the best cantrip small creatures, and green gets the best cantrip large creatures. While white is still tertiary at card drawing, we have added some new abilities for white to draw cards. The big limitation is that white tends to draw over time rather than all at once, so it has a once-per-turn limit on card drawing (multiplayer does allow white on occasion to draw multiple cards tied to how many opponents a player has). Other than cantrips, red only draws cards with three exceptions: impulsive draw, "punisher" effects, and wheeling. (See **impulsive draw**, "punisher" effects, and **wheeling**.)




---

**Card filtering (Look at the top N cards of your library and put N in your hand and put the rest on the bottom of the library in any order.)**


Primary: Blue and green


Blue is the color of information, so it loves having the ability to choose what exactly it gets to draw. Sometimes card filtering looks similar to looting, where you draw some number of cards and then discard a close number. When green does this, it can usually only get a subset of permanents (usually creatures and/or lands) into its hand.




---

**Cast spells from opponent's graveyard/exile.**


Primary: Blue and black


The two sneakiest colors are the ones most likely to use the opponent's own resources against them. Sometimes blue and black will make the player discard/mill the cards into exile where they can later cast them.




---

**Cast spells from your graveyard.**


Primary: Black  

 Secondary: Blue and red  

 Tertiary: White and green


Black is the color most likely to cast cards from the graveyard, but it's something blue and red also do on occasion, especially instants and sorceries. I've listed white and green as tertiary because we do flashback with regularity.




---

**Cast spells out of graveyard.**


Primary: Black  

 Secondary: Blue and red


Black is the color most focused on the graveyard. Blue occasionally can cast instants and sorceries out of the graveyard. We've also let red play a little in this area, especially in sets where it can grant flashback to instants and sorceries in the graveyard.




---

**Changing lands (Target land becomes the basic land of your choice.)**


Primary: Blue


We don't do a lot of land changing these days, but the ability is still in blue in environments where we might need it. It allows blue a way to get access to other colors in multicolor environments.




---

**Color changing (Target/this creature becomes the color(s) of your choice until end of turn.)**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Green  

 Tertiary: White and black


Blue can change any creature's color, including its own. Green has this ability on creatures that can change themselves, usually flavored as a chameleon-like effect. White and black have had the ability on rare occasion to make things their own color. As we've lessened the number of effects that care about color, this ability isn't used much these days.




---

**Copying permanents, permanently**


Primary: Blue


Blue has permanents that will choose a target and then remain that target for the rest of the game (or until the permanent chooses to copy a new target).




---

**Copying permanents, temporarily**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Blue


Red has permanents (or spells that create this effect) that can temporarily become another creature, usually until end of turn. Blue's cards in this category are cards that change but don't let the controller explicitly choose what they become. (For instance, one might copy the last creature played.)




---

**+1/+1 counter (creation and caring)**


Primary: White and green  

 Secondary: Black  

 Tertiary: Blue and red


Any color can put +1/+1 counters on themselves, but white and green are best overall at doing it, including putting them on other creatures.




---

**Counterspell**


Primary: Blue  

 Tertiary: White


Counterspelling is one of the few abilities that's almost universally used in a single color. White dips its toe into the ability with taxing and delay-style counterspells.




---

**Counter target activated/triggered ability**


Primary: Blue  

 Tertiary: Green


For a while this was a green effect, but we've moved it to be more in blue. Green does it on rare occasions, usually to counter artifact activations these days.




---

**Creature destruction, single creature**


* **Destroy target creature.**

Primary: Black  

 Secondary: White


Black is king of creature destruction and is the one color that can kill regardless of circumstance. White can kill a single creature, but usually at a higher cost. Sometimes in both white and black this spell exiles the creature instead of destroying it.


* **Destroy target creature. Its controller gets compensation.**

Primary: White


This ability used to be in white and blue (flavored as transformation in blue), but it's now just a white ability.


* **Destroy target attacking or blocking creature.**

Primary: White


White tends to do its creature destruction in one of four ways: white can kill during combat, it sometimes will just hit attackers or just hit blockers, or white will often exile creatures instead of destroying then.


* **Destroy target creature that damaged you or a creature you control this turn.**

Primary: White


White is also willing to destroy something after it has hurt white in some way.


* **Destroy target tapped creature.**

Primary: White  

 Secondary: Black


White can also destroyed tapped creatures using a similar flavor to destroying creatures that have harmed it.


* **Destroy target creature with power 3 or greater.**

Primary: White


As champion of the little guy, white will also destroy large creatures. We've moved the floor of the ability from power 4 to power 3.


* **Destroy target creature with flying.**

Primary: Green


Green is allowed to kill only two types of creatures—flying creatures (as it is the anti-flying color) and artifact creatures (see **artifact destruction**).




---

**Creature destruction, mass creature**


* **Destroy all creatures.**

Primary: White  

 Secondary: Black


White is the color that most often does mass creature kill, with it showing up on a rare or mythic rare in almost every set. Black mass-creature kill is not quite as frequent. Red has a similar effect where it does large amount of damage to all creatures (see **direct damage**).


* **Destroy all creatures controlled by one player.**

Primary: Black


White believes in balance and parity, so only black will kill just one player's creatures.


* **Destroy all creatures with power 3 or greater.**

Primary: White


Killing big creatures is a white thing, so it can be combined with mass creature kill. The number is most often 3 power, but occasionally can be tweaked up. White will occasionally also do mass destruction based on other criteria, but it tends to destroy all creatures of that quality.




---

**Creature pumping**


* **+N/+N (on creatures)**

Primary: Black  

 Secondary: Green


For black this is mostly seen on Shades and usually requires black mana. Green gets unlimited pumping activations but usually only when the activation cost is high enough that multiple activations don't happen until the late game.


* **+N/+N (on creatures, single use)**

Primary: Green


This is what we refer to as the [Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) ability. It's trying to simulate a built-in [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth). It's almost always exclusive to green.


* **+N/+N (on spells)**

Primary: White and green  

 Secondary: Black and red


The most common use of this is on Giant Growth–like effects in green, usually +3/+3 but it can vary a little. White's pumping is usually +2/+2 or smaller, but it most often will grant an ability as well. The three exception for white is that it can get larger pumps if counting the number of creatures you have, the number of plains you have, or is restricted to blockers. Black will occasionally get smaller buffs, usually with an ability added. Red gets buffs but usually the power is higher than the toughness. All four colors default in this ability to being on instants as it's a combat trick.


* **+N/+N (on Auras)**

Primary: White and green  

 Secondary: Blue, black, and red


All colors have access to Auras that grant +N/+N. White, blue, black, and red tend to top out at +2/+2. Green is the one color that regularly grants +3/+3 and above on Auras


* **+N/+0 (on creatures)**

Primary: Red  

 Secondary: White and green


This ability, as a repeatable activation, is what we refer to as "firebreathing." It's most often seen on red creatures. White tends to get one-time upgrades of usually +1/+0. Green gets +N/+0 when it's not intended for it to survive the fight.


* **+N/+0 (on spells)**

Primary: Black and red  

 Secondary: White


Black and red are the two colors that tend to pump power as a spell without also pumping toughness. White does it occasionally as a combat trick but usually never more than +1/+0.


* **+N/+0 (on Auras)**

Primary: Red  

 Secondary: White and black  

 Tertiary: Blue and green


Red is the color most often to have just power-pumping Auras (including "firebreathing" Auras). White and black do it occasionally with white tending to go no higher than +2/+0. Blue and green do it on rare occasion with blue, like white, sticking at +2/+0 or lower.


* **+N/-N (on creatures)**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Black and red


Blue tends to use this mostly on Elementals and Shapeshifters, flavored as shape-changing. Black and red use this on occasion to play up their reckless side.


* **+N/-N (on spells)**

Primary: Black


As this is mostly used as a kill spell, the ability resides mostly in black.


* **+N/-N (on Auras)**

Primary: Black  

 Secondary: Red


These tend to be flavored as "push your luck" cards that can double as creature kill. Black will go up to -3 on the toughness, whereas red tends to stop at -2.


* **-N/+N (on creatures)**

Primary: Blue  

 Tertiary white


This is also used in blue on Elementals and Shapeshifters, often on the same cards with the +N/-N. White, on rare occasion, will have an activation that uses this defensively.


* **-N/-N (on creatures)**

Primary: Black


On creatures, this effect is used almost exclusively by creatures on other creatures, and almost exclusively in black.


* **-N/-N (on spells)**

Primary: Black  

 Tertiary: White, blue, red, and green


Black is the only color to do -N/-N abilities on spells. Other colors do put -1/-1 counters on creatures, usually in place of spots where they would do damage in sets with -1/-1 counters.


* **-N/-N (on Auras)**

Primary: Black


This is an area only black tends to go, used almost exclusively on the opponent's creatures. This ability will occasionally be paired with a positive ability, making it a card you might play on your own creature.


* **-N/-0 (on spells)**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Black


In blue, this is shrinking its target. In black it's usually some form of torture.


* **-N/-0 (on Auras)**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Black


We tend to treat the Auras similarly to how we treat the spells.


* **+0/+N (on creatures)**

Primary: White  

 Secondary: Green


White used to do this quite a bit, but we've backed off because it tends to just clog up the board. Green also uses this on occasion.


* **+0/+N (on spells)**

Primary: White  

 Secondary: Green


Once again, white (and to an even lesser extent green) used to do this more often, but these days we'll boost power some if we're going to boost toughness.


* **+0/+N (on Auras)**

Primary: White  

 Secondary: Blue and green


This is also isn't done often, but when it is used, it's used on white, blue, and green.




---

**Creature pumping, your team, one-shot**


* **+N/+N to your team**

Primary: White  

 Secondary: Green


White is the color most likely to pump its team, most often with +1/+1, but it will occasionally go up to +2/+2. Green's team pump starts at +3/+3 and often also adds trample.


* **+N/+0 to your team**

Primary: Red  

 Secondary: White


Team pump that only pumps power is most often done in red, usually affecting attacking creatures. White will sometimes pump its team's power without pumping toughness (although it more often pumps both).




---

**Creature pumping, their team, one-shot**


* **-N/-N to their team**

Primary: Black


This is a common way for black to kill creatures. Sometimes this effect will affect all creatures and not just your opponents.


* **-N/-0 to their team**

Primary: Blue


Just as blue can "shrink" a single creature, so too can it "shrink" an entire team.




---

**Creature pumping, your team, ongoing**


* **+N/+N to your team**

Primary: White  

 Secondary: Green  

 Tertiary: Blue, black, and red


This category appears mostly on permanents, most often creatures or enchantments, and it grants a stat boost to your team. This ability is most often seen in white with just a +1/+1 boost. Green boosts are often a bit bigger. All the colors have access to this ability when making tribal lords (creatures that grant a certain creature type or types a +1/+1 bonus). This stat bonus often comes with the granting of another ability.


* **+N/+0 to your team**

Primary: Red  

 Tertiary: Black


When red does permanent pumps, it is usually just pumping the power. Often it pumps your creatures just on attack.




---

**Creature pumping, their team, ongoing**


* **-N/-N to their team**

Primary: Black


Black occasionally lowers the opponent's creatures' power and toughness, usually by just -1/-1.




---

**Creature sacrifice, forced, repeatable** **(All players/opponents must sacrifice a creature each turn.)**


Primary: Black


Sometimes black likes killing things slowly.




---

**"Curiosity" (Whenever this creature deals combat damage to an opponent, draw a card.)**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Green


This ability started as a blue-only ability, but we added it in green because it works with green's creature-tied card drawing.




---

**Damage prevention (Prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to target creature/player.)**


Primary: White


We don't do a lot of this effect any more, but when we do it's almost always in white.




---

**Damage redirection (Prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to target creature/player this turn. If damage is prevented in this way, this card deals that much damage to target creature/player.)**


Primary: White


This is another effect we've cut significantly back on that is also squarely in white.




---

**"Daunt" (This creature can't be blocked by creatures with power 2 or less.)**


Primary: Green


This is an ability we've been trying out in small doses in green. I don't know if it will ever make it to evergreen status, but it's a possibility.




---

**Deal damage when blocked**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Black  

 Tertiary: Blue


This is an effect that goes on creatures. It is done primarily in red. When black does it, it is usually loss of life. I list blue because the afflict mechanic (from *Hour of Devastation*) that does this is also in blue (as Bolas's Eternal Zombie army was in Bolas's colors: blue, black, and red).




---

**Deathtouch**


Primary: Black  

 Secondary: Green


This ability was primary in both black and green for a while, but we found that black both had more need for it and had more flavorful ways to express it creatively.




---

**Defender**


Primary: White and blue  

 Secondary: Black, red, and green


Basically everyone can have defender, but it leans toward white and blue philosophically as those are the most defensive colors.




---

**"Devil's Deal" permanents (Cards that grant you power but at a cost)**


Primary: Black


Black is the color of "power at any cost," so it gets permanents (usually) that start helping you but have the potential to hurt you in the end. These are most often creatures or enchantments, but occasionally show up in other forms.




---

**Direct damage, single target**


* **Deal N damage to creature, planeswalker, and/or player.**

Primary: Red  

 Secondary: White and black


Red is king of direct damage and has it in many forms, including the most straightforward versions. White can do damage where N is the number of creatures you control. Black will do direct damage to creatures, planeswalkers, or players and then gain life. (See **drain life**.) Black will sometimes deal damage to players as a punishment.


* **Deal N damage to a creature that's been damaged this turn.**

Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Black


Black and red are the colors that prey on the weak.


* **Sacrifice a creature and deal damage to creature/planeswalker/player equal to the sacrificed creature's power/toughness.**

Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Black


In red, this is flavored as throwing the creatures. In black, it's more treated as a sacrifice for a ritual.


* **Deal N damage to a creature/planeswalker/player where N is the number of cards in your hand/your opponent's hand.**

Primary: Red


We tend to do this in sets when red has a more spell-based theme.


* **Deal N damage to target attacking or blocking creature.**

Primary: White


Other than basing damage on number of creatures, white's direct damage only shows up in combat.


* **Deal N damage to a creature with flying.**

Primary: Green  

 Tertiary: Red


As the two anti-flying colors, red and green will deal damage to fliers. Green does it significantly more than red, as any of red's direct damage to creatures can hit fliers.




---

**Direct damage, multiple targets**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: White


Red will deal damage to all or a subset of creatures, sometimes dealing a small amount (1 or 2 damage, killing small creatures), sometimes doing larger amounts that kill most creatures. Red's damage in this area most often hits all creatures, including its own. White will occasionally deal damage to multiple creature if they all are attackers and/or blockers.




---

**Discard as a cost**


Primary: Black  

 Secondary: Red  

 Tertiary: White, blue, and green


While all colors have access to discarding cards as a cost, black does it most and red does it second most.




---

**Discard as effect**


Primary: Black


This is one of only a handful of major abilities to be contained to just one color. The closest a second color comes is blue, which occasionally gets targeted card filtering that can be used on the opponent.




---

**Double strike**


Primary: White and red


White and red are also the primary colors for first strike. Black, which is tertiary in first strike, does not get double strike.




---

**"Drain life" (Deal damage to a creature/player and gain life equal to that damage.)**


Primary: Black  

 Tertiary: White


Other colors will deal damage or gain life, but black is the color that does both at the same time. (Okay, technically, red and white together can do this too.) Black also will do triggered or activated effects that repeatedly drain the player, usually for 1. White has dipped its toe into this area in Orzhov sets (aka *Ravnica* sets).




---

**Enchantment destruction**


Primary: White and green  

 Secondary: Black


White and green usually have one enchantment destruction card in common; green's usually also destroys artifacts, and sometimes white does as well. (See **artifact destruction**.) We've also started to let black have enchantment removal. It's clearly at a power level lower than white or green and often forces the opponent to sacrifice the enchantment or makes you pay an extra cost.




---

**"Enchantress" ability (Whenever you play an enchantment, draw a card.)**


Primary: White and green


This ability started in *Limited Edition (Alpha)* on [Verduran Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verduran+Enchantress), a green card. It has bounced back and forth between green and white, and now can be done by either. In white, it has the limitation of only drawing one card per turn as that's a new rule for white card drawing. The best ones are probably going to appear in white *and* green.




---

**Exiling cards from graveyard**


Primary: Black  

 Secondary: White


This effect is used to get rid of cards in a graveyard that might have an effect/usable activation cost. Black does it most often, but white occasionally does it in sets that need it.




---

**Extra attack (Untap all creatures that attacked this turn. After this main phase, there is an additional combat phase followed by an additional main phase.)**


Primary: Red  

 Tertiary: White


Attacking twice has always been red's domain. Thematically, it makes sense that white might occasionally do this.








F–L
---





**Fight**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Red


This is green's primary form of creature destruction. Red uses it occasionally but at a much lower volume.




---

**First strike**


Primary: White and red  

 Tertiary: Black


White and red are the two cards with trained fighters (white has the army and red the creatures that have gotten good through constant impulsive fighting). Black is tertiary, and uses this these days almost exclusively on Knights.




---

**Flash**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: White, black, and green  

 Tertiary: Red


Everyone gets some access to flash. Blue gets it the most as it plays into the color's reactive play style. In the last few years, we made it secondary in white and black, and kept it secondary in green. White tends to get the small cheap and mid-size defensive creatures, black gets creatures that can surprise kill you, often with higher power than toughness, and green gets bigger creatures. Red can get flash when it functionally needs it to get an effect to work, most often with reactive enters-the-battlefield effects.




---

**"Flicker" (Exile target creature/permanent, then return it to the battlefield under its owner's control—occasionally the creature/permanent returns at the end of the turn.)**


Primary: White and blue


This ability appears in both white and blue, although we've recently been trying to push it a little more in white.




---

**Flying**


Primary: White and blue  

 Secondary: Black and red  

 Tertiary: Green


White and blue are the two main colors with flying. Blue gets the most fliers. White gets the most efficient small fliers. Blue more often grants flying, although white does it on occasion. Red's flying is mostly restricted to Dragons and Phoenixes with the occasional weak small fliers. Green's tertiary is almost a quaternary, in that it gets flying *very* infrequently.




---

**"Fog" (Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.)**


Primary: Green  

 Tertiary: White


This effect has shown up in four of the five colors over the years. It started in green, spent numerous years bouncing around, ended up in white, and then finally got moved back to green where it has stayed.




---

**Forced attack (Target creature attacks this turn if able.)**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Blue


We don't use this ability a lot, but when we do, we use it in red and blue. Red is flavored as emotional tampering and blue as mind control.




---

**Forced block (Target creature must block this turn.)**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Red


We don't do this effect often, but green does it most, then red.




---

**Forced sacrifice**


* **Sacrifice a creature. (Target/all player(s) sacrifice a creature.)**

Primary: Black


Sometimes black kills your creatures and sometimes it makes you do it.


* **Sacrifice an artifact. (Target/all player(s) sacrifice an artifact.)**

Primary: Red


Red can force you to sacrifice artifacts.


* **Sacrifice a permanent. (Target/all player(s) sacrifice a permanent.)**

Red can also force you to sacrifice permanents.




---

**"Freeze" creature (Tap target creature. That creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.)**


Primary: Blue


This is a blue ability that R&D has grown fond of in recent years.




---

**Friendly to a card type**


This can involve a wide range of things where you either help that card type (making it cheaper to cast, enhancing it in some way, using it to generate an effect, etc.) or that card type helps you (you get rewarded for playing that card type, having a certain number on the battlefield or in your hand or in the graveyard grants abilities, you can sacrifice them as a resource, etc.)


* **Friendly to artifacts**

Primary: White and blue  

 Secondary: Red


White and blue, as the colors of civilization, are both very friendly with artifacts. Red tends to be associated with Equipment and Vehicles (along with white) or using artifacts as a resource (interacting with things like treasure artifact tokens).


* **Friendly to creatures**

Primary: Green  

 Secondary: White


Green and white are the main creature colors (they have the highest percentage of creatures versus spells) so they most often like you having creatures.


* **Friendly to enchantments**

Primary: White and green  

 Tertiary: Black


White and green are also the two colors that most appreciate enchantments. Black sometimes cares in sets with an enchantment theme or subtheme.


* **Friendly to instants and sorceries**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Red


The creature colors like creatures, the spell colors like instants and sorceries.


* **Friendly to lands**

Primary: Green  

 Secondary: White, blue, black, and red


Green is the color that loves lands the most, but every color loves its own basic land type.




---

* **Friendly to planeswalkers**

Primary: White


White is the color that most interacts with planeswalkers. It can search the library for them and get them back from the graveyard, among other positive interactions.




---

**Friendly to other qualities**


* **Friendly to legendary permanents**

Primary: White


White is the color that most interacts with legendary permanents. It can search the library for them and get them back from the graveyard, among other positive interactions.


* **Friendly to low mana value cards**

Primary: White


White is the color that most positively interacts with low mana value (anywhere from mana value 3 or less) cards. It can search the library for them and get them back from the graveyard, among other positive interactions.




---

**Gain control of target player's turn**


Primary: Black


This effect is actually most often done in colorless, but black is the color that can do it in the color pie.




---

**"Gaseous Form" (This creature neither deals nor receives damage.)**


Primary: White  

 Secondary: Blue


We don't do this effect much any more, but years back we moved it from blue to white (and in the very early days it showed up in green as a Fog variant). White will grant the ability to creatures, whereas blue tends to have the ability on creatures.




---

**Haste**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Black and green


Haste shows up most often on red creatures. We've moved green into second place for haste. Black is still technically secondary, but gets haste less often than green.




---

**Hexproof**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Green  

 Tertiary: White


Blue both has more creatures with hexproof and more often grants it as a pseudo-counterspell. Green tends to get hexproof on larger creatures without evasion. White gets hexproof infrequently, sometimes on players, in ways that feel like it's protecting the thing.




---

**"Illusion ability" (Sacrifice this creature if it is the target of a spell or ability.)**


Primary: Blue


This ability started in black on Spirits and was known as "skulking," but has since been moved into blue and attached to Illusions. The ability used to care about spells and abilities, but now just cares about spells.




---

**"Impulsive draw" (Exile the top N cards of your library. Until end of turn, you may play cards exiled this way.)**


Primary: Red


This is red's primary way of card drawing, playing into red's impulsive nature of wanting to do things now. Sometimes we let you cast the spell until the end of your next turn.




---

**Increasing counters and/or tokens**


Primary: Blue and green  

 Secondary: White


This effect either makes more counters or tokens as they're being made or makes more after they've already been made. Sometimes this is one for one, sometimes it just adds one or two more. Blue and green do it most often, but we've started letting white in on the fun.




---

**Indestructible**


Primary: White  

 Secondary: Black and green  

 Tertiary: Blue and red


White, and to a lesser extent green, tend to have creature that naturally have indestructible. Black and green, as the replacement for regeneration, often have activated abilities that grant indestructible until end of turn. White will at times use temporary indestructibility where it used to use protection. We allow all colors access to it when we do things like cycles of Gods.




---

**Instant and/or sorcery triggers (Whenever you cast an instant and/or sorcery . . . )**


Primary: Blue and red


Blue and red are the two colors with the highest percentage of spells (as opposed to creatures), so they are the two colors that most often care about them being cast.




---

**Land destruction**


Primary: Red  

 Tertiary: Black and green


Red is the one color that regularly does land destruction. Black and green are still able to do it, but do it very infrequently. Most land destruction in green these days (and "these days" hasn't been in a while) is "destroy target noncreature permanent."




---

**"Lhurgoyf" (This creature's power and toughness are equal to the number of cards in your/all graveyards.)**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Black  

 Tertiary: White, blue, and red


Lhurgoyfs started as a green thing and have since gone on to also be a black thing. On rare occasion, we'll have other colors play in this space, either in a cycle or by caring about some different quality of card in the graveyard. Another change is that sometimes we'll care about the number when casting and lock it down with +1/+1 counters rather than it being a stat you have to keep checking on.




---

**Life gain**


Primary: White and green  

 Secondary: Black


White and green are the two colors that will have effects that simply gain a player life. Black can gain life but only when either sacrificing something, using lifelink, or damaging another creature or player. (See **drain life**.) White will sometimes gain life when other creatures enter the battlefield and black will sometimes gain life when other creatures die.




---

**Life loss as an effect**


Primary: Black


Black will sometimes just make players lose life straight up without a drain effect.




---

**Life loss as a cost**


Primary: Black  

 Tertiary: White, blue, red, and green


Black is the color that most often uses life as a cost. All colors have access to it on rare occasions where the world calls for it (like New Phyrexia).




---

**Lifelink**


Primary: White and black


White and black have very different flavor rationales for the abilities, but both use it almost every set.




---

**"Lockdown" (Enchanted creature doesn't untap.)**


Primary: Blue


This is one of blue's primary creature answers in Limited. It's used almost solely on Auras. See **freeze** for a temporary version, also in blue.




---

**"Lobotomy" (Choose a non-land card name. Search target player's graveyard hand and library for all cards with that name and exile them.)**


Primary: Black


This ability started on a blue-black card in *Tempest* called [Lobotomy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=23170), but has since drifted to be just a black thing.




---

**Looking at opponent's hand**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Black


Blue is the color that can simply do this effect. Black does it only in conjunction with discarding where it has to choose what gets discarded. We've been scaling back on this effect, as it tends to slow down gameplay. This has had the interesting effect of making the ability appear more in black than blue, as we still make the discard spells.




---

**"Looting" (Draw a card and discard a card.)**


Primary: Blue


Blue is the color that likes to go searching for answers by digging through its library.




---

**"Lure" (All creatures able to block this creature must do so.)**


Primary: Green


This ability has been with *Magic* since *Limited Edition (Alpha)*, but we've started scaling back how often we do it. It's done infrequently now, and only at higher rarities because of its impact on Limited.


**"Lure," limited (This creature must be blocked this turn if able.)**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Red


This is the watered-down version of [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure). Somebody must block your creature, but everyone doesn't have to. We started occasionally using the ability in red.







M–R

**Mana production, permanent**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Blue  

 Tertiary: Black


Besides being the land-fetching color, green is also the color with permanents that can produce mana turn after turn to help it ramp up quickly and cast large spells. Black does this infrequently, usually with some payment required. Blue has access to permanents that produce colorless man, sometimes flavored to helping cast artifacts.




---

**Mana production, temporary** 


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Black


Red is the color best at producing temporary bursts of mana, be it with one-shot spells, permanents with one-time triggers, or things that need to be sacrificed to be used. Black can also get mana but usually requires paying some cost, most often sacrificing something else.




---

**"Manipulate time" (End the turn.)**


Primary: Blue  

 Tertiary: Red


We don't do this ability very often, but when we do it's put in blue and flavored as time manipulation. Red has done it once with a "lose at end of next turn" rider.




---

**"Maro" ability (This creature's power and toughness are equal to the number of cards in our hand.)**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Green


Blue is the color of knowledge and green is the color of wisdom, so those are the two colors that like to care about what you "know."




---

**"Meddling" (Name a spell. That spell can't be played as long as this card is on the battlefield.)**


Primary: White


This ability, named after [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) from *Invasion* (Chris Pikula's Invitational card), is usually on a creature or enchantment and stops a specific spell from being cast. As this is proactive, it's in white.




---

**Menace**


Primary: Black and red


This ability started in red when it was an unnamed thing, but was added to black when it became keyworded because intimidate had gone away and black needed some kind of evasion other than flying. There's been some talk that a third color should be secondary or tertiary.




---

**Milling (You/target player puts the top N cards from his or her library into his or her graveyard.)**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Black


For many years this ability was only in blue, but a number of years ago we started allowing black to do it as well. Both colors also get self-mill as an effect and a cost.




---

**Moving enchantments/counters**


Primary: Blue


Blue is the color of moving attached things. It hasn't moved Equipment yet, but perhaps one day.




---

**Must attack**


Primary: Red


The flavor of this is great in red, but we've found the gameplay is not always great. So we've been doing less of this in red overall.




---

**Pacifism-like effect (Enchanted creature cannot attack or block.)**


Primary: White


This is one of white's strongest forms of creature removal for Limited, usually in the form of an Aura. It infrequently is used on noncreatures. Sometimes the spell also prevents that creature/permanent from using activations. It also sometimes only stops just attacking or just blocking.




---

**"Panic" (Target creature can't block this turn.)**


Primary: Red


This ability mostly shows up on spells but occasionally as an activated ability at higher rarities.




---

**Planeswalker destruction** 


Primary: Black  

 Tertiary: Green


Black is the color that regularly destroys planeswalkers, often using "destroy creature or planeswalker." Green doesn't call out planeswalker by name ([Nissa's Defeat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Defeat) being an exception), but can "destroy target noncreature." Green is now tertiary in this as we don't use this ability much any more in green. Red is not listed here because it uses redirected damage to deal with planeswalkers rather than destroy them outright.




---

**Playing cards off the top of your library, paying their mana cost (You may look at the top card of your library and if it's a [blah] you may play it.)**


Secondary: White, blue, black, red, and green


We don't do this effect very often, so I made it primary in no color. Any color can have access to it, but it must play cards from a subset that make sense for that color. Blue is the color we've let cast any card off the top.




---

**Playing cards off the top of library, for free**


Primary: Red


This ability used to be in blue, but we moved it to red as it has a chaotic feel (you don't know what's about to happen) and red needed more stuff.




---

**Playing cards off the top of opponent's library**


Primary: Blue and black  

 Secondary: Red


Blue and black, being the sneaky colors, are the two that most often cast spells off the opponent's deck. We occasionally let red do it, but usually there's a short duration during which you can do it, unlike blue and black that usually doesn't have a time limit.




---

**Play extra lands/Put a land from hand onto the battlefield**


Primary: Green


We don't do either of these effects often, but they are both in green's slice of the color pie.




---

**"Polymorph" (Exile target creature. Its controller reveals cards from the top of his or her library until he or she reveals a creature card. That player puts that card onto the battlefield.)**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Blue


For a long time, this ability was a blue thing. When we were looking for more places to expand red, we decided to slice up the polymorph pie. Blue gets transformations where the outcome is known and red gets them where it is not. The idea being that blue only wants to transform something when they know what they're going to get, whereas red is willing to take a risk. Red will also do large chaotic effects where many things change all at once.




---

**Preventing actions (Your opponents can't cast spells this turn.)** 


Primary: White


White is the proactive color, stopping things from before they happen (as opposed to blue being reactive, stopping things as they happen).




---

**Protection**


Primary: White  

 Tertiary: Blue, black, red, and green


Protection has changed back from deciduous status back to evergreen status, but it doesn't show up in every set. It's mostly a white ability that can show up in other colors, usually with protection from something the color dislikes (an enemy color, artifacts for green, etc.).




---

**Prowess**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Red  

 Tertiary: White


This ability started out as a Jeskai keyword in *Khans of Tarkir*. It filled a gap we had in blue and red, so that's where we focused it. White has not yet gotten a prowess card outside of *Khans of Tarkir* block, but I believe it eventually will. For a while this ability was evergreen, but it's since become deciduous (and even then, barely). I don't list most of the deciduous abilities in this article, but as this used to be evergreen, I left it in.




---

**"Punisher" effects (Opponent chooses one: thing X happens or thing Y happens.)​**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Black


In red, one of the two abilities is usually damage to the opponent making the choice; the other option is often something red doesn't normally do in the color pie. Black does this a little, but doesn't tend to have the color pie–bending aspect.




---

**Putting cards from hand onto the battlefield**


* **Putting artifacts from hand onto the battlefield**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: White


Blue does this as the "friendly to artifacts" color. White will do it when it involves Equipment.


* **Putting creatures from hand onto the battlefield**

Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Blue and red  

 Tertiary: White and black


Green does this effect the most often. Blue will do it usually flavored as transformation, and will return one its creatures to its owner's hand. When red does this the creature is most often sacrificed or returned to hand at end of turn. We let all colors dip their toes in this area when messing with creature types of their color.


* **Putting enchantments from hand onto the battlefield**

Primary: White  

 Secondary: Green  

 Tertiary: Blue


This is another effect we don't do that often. White and, interestingly, blue tend to do this tied to Auras, while green will put out any enchantment.


* **Putting lands from hand onto the battlefield**

Primary: Green


Green used to do this all the time. It still does it, but not as often as it used to.


* **Putting planeswalkers from hand onto the battlefield**

Primary: White


We haven't actually done this effect yet. My best guess is it would be in white.




---

**Random destruction effects (Destruction where the outcome is unknown at the time of casting.)**


Primary: Red


Red is the color of chaos, so we occasionally give it effects that destroy random nonenchantment permanents (sometimes a subset).




---

**Reach**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Red  

 Tertiary: White


As green mostly has no flying, this is one of the tools green has to deal with other players' flying creatures. We've very recently decided to make it secondary in red. White's tertiary status comes mostly on archers.




---

**"Reanimate" permanent (Return a permanent card from a graveyard to the battlefield.)**


Primary: White


White is the one color that can reanimate any permanent type, so it gets to reanimate "target permanent." It can also reanimate "target artifact," "target enchantment," or "target planeswalker." It doesn't specifically get "target land," but can do so when it's "target permanent."




---

**"Reanimation" (Return a creature card from a graveyard to the battlefield.)**


Primary: White and black  

 Secondary: Red and green


Black is the best at bringing the dead back to life. It has no real restrictions on what it can bring back. White tends to reanimate smaller creatures, usually with a converted mana cost of 2 or less, but we've started letting white bring back larger creatures on occasion. Red has Phoenixes. Green has creatures that can bring themselves back from the graveyard. Both black and white will sometimes reanimate a swath of creatures all at once.




---

**Removing counters**


Primary: Black


Black is the color that gets rid of counters, but only from permanents on the battlefield and not players.




---

**"Restocking" (Putting cards from graveyard back into your library)**


Primary: Green and blue


This is a means of getting cards in your graveyard back into your library. Green does it as a "cycle of life" flavor, while blue is flavored more as magical manipulation. Blue sometimes also shuffling your hand in as well and then draws you cards.




---

**Returning cards from graveyard to hand.**


* **Return target card from graveyard to hand.**

Primary: Green


The ability to get back any card is mostly done in green and usually appears at uncommon or higher in rarity.


* **Return target artifact from graveyard to hand.**

Primary: White


Blue used to be the color that returned artifacts from the graveyard to the hand, but the ability is now in white.




---

**Return target creature from graveyard to hand.**


Primary: Black  

 Secondary: White


Black can return any creature, but only from your graveyard. (We don't allow you to put other player's cards in your hand.) Black will often do this as an enters-the-battlefield effect nicknamed a "[Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)," as that's the card that did it first. White usually returns creatures with smaller converted mana costs.


* **Return target enchantment from graveyard to hand.**

Primary: White


Getting back enchantments is primarily a white thing.


* **Return target instant from graveyard to hand.**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Red


As blue and red are the spell colors (they have the highest percentage of spells versus creatures), they are the two colors that can get instants back. When there is a choice to separate them, blue leans toward getting back instants and red leans toward getting back sorceries.


* **Return target land from graveyard to hand.**

Primary: Green


While green can get back any card, when the card types are divvied up, green often gets back lands.


* **Return target sorcery from graveyard to hand.**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Red


This is the same as for getting back instants, but the colors are swapped.




---

**Return to hand (Return target creature/permanent to its owner's hand.)**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: White  

 Tertiary: Green


Blue can bounce any type of permanent, although these days doesn't often bounce lands. It also will often bounce a creature via an enters-the-battlefield effect. (R&D refers to these as "[Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413601)s," based on the first card that did it.) White can only bounce its own permanents to protect them (and often to do cool combo-ish things). Green bounces creatures as a cost for playing bigger creatures.




---

**Rewards for death (Whenever another creature/creature you control dies . . . )**


Primary: Black  

 Secondary: White  

 Tertiary: Red


Black is the color that most triggers off of other things dying, usually flavored as gaining strength from others' pain. White usually gains life, creates a token creature, or helps the creature go somewhere other than the graveyard, often your hand. Red tends to create creature tokens or deal damage.




---

**Rules setting** 


Primary: White  

 Secondary: Blue, black, red, and green


These cards are permanents, mostly creatures and enchantments, that change some basic rule of the game. Every color has some amount of access to do this, but white does it at the highest volume.




---

**"Rummaging" (Discard a card and draw a card.)**


Primary: Red


Red has its version of "looting" (see **looting**), but its recklessness has it discard the card before drawing.







**S–Z**
-------






**Sacrifice a permanent.**


* **Sacrifice an artifact.**

Primary: Black and red


Black and red are the most likely to sacrifice artifacts to generate an effect.


* **Sacrifice a creature.**

Primary: Black and red


Black and red are the two most likely colors to sacrifice creatures. This is often part of a draft archetype.


* **Sacrifice an enchantment.**

Primary: Red and green


Red and green are the two colors that most often sacrifice enchantments. This only tends to get used in sets with enchantment themes.


* **Sacrifice a land.**

Primary: Red


Red is the color most likely to sacrifice lands.


* **Sacrifice a permanent.**

Primary: Red  

 Seconary: black


Red is the color most likely to sacrifice any permanent as it's the color that can individually sacrifice them all. We are letting black do this a little more.




---

**Scry**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: White, black, red, and green


All colors have access to scry but blue gets the most. Blue also gets the largest scry numbers with red getting the lowest.




---

**"Sengir" ability (When a creature damaged by this creature dies, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.)**


Primary: Black


This ability appeared in *Limited Edition (Alpha)* on [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) and gets used occasionally in black. Because it doesn't often result in the creature getting +1/+1 counters, we now often do variations of it.




---

**"Specter" ability (When this creature deals combat damage to an opponent, that player discards a card.)**


Primary: Black


This ability is often tied to the Specter creature type. Just as the "curiosity" ability is in the card drawing color, so too is the "Specter" ability in the discard color, black.




---

**Spell copying (Copy target instant or sorcery spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.)**


Primary: Blue and red


This ability is mostly done at rare. We bounced back and forth between whether blue or red was supposed to do it and finally let them both do it.




---

**Spell redirection (Change the target of target spell and/or ability with a single target.)**


Primary: Blue and red


The same thing happened with spell redirection as spell copying, and we ended up with the same solution—letting both colors do it. We've started letting some of these effects redirect abilities as well as spells.




---

**"Stalking" (This creature can't be blocked by more than one creature.)**


Primary: Green


This is usually used on creatures 3/3 or bigger.




---

**Stealing permanents, permanently**


Primary: Blue  

 Tertiary: Black


Blue is the main color to gain control of other players' permanents. It can steal any type of permanent but most often steals creatures. Black is allowed to steal things infrequently. Red also steals but only temporarily (see below).




---

**Stealing permanents, temporarily**


Primary: Red


Red takes control of permanents, mostly creatures, for the turn, gives them haste, and then returns them at end of turn.




---

**"Super trample" (You may have this creature assign combat damage as though it weren't blocked.)**


Primary: Green


We don't do this ability very often, but when we do, we do it in green.




---

**Switch power/toughness**


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Red


Blue does this most often, but red does it on occasion. Sometimes this is on creatures that can switch their own power and toughness.




---

**Tapping creatures**


Primary: White  

 Secondary: Blue


White is the main color of tapping creatures. Blue usually taps creatures only when also given the ability to untap them. (See **twiddle**.) The one exception is when it "freezes" creatures. (See **freezing**.)




---

**Taxing**


Primary: White  

 Secondary: Blue


Taxing cards are ones that force the opponent to pay some cost to do an activity they could normally do without an additional cost. Taxing cards are most often creatures and enchantments, but occasionally are done as one-shot spells. Most of blue's taxing has gone to white (it used to be primary in blue), but blue still gets taxing counterspells (such as [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)).




---

**"Time Walk" (Take an extra turn after this one.)**


Primary: Blue  

 Tertiary: Red


Blue is the main color to take extra turns. It usually does it at mythic rare. Red on rare occasion will do a "[Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383131)" that comes with some big penalty—often losing the game at the end of the extra turn.




---

**Token generation**


Primary: White and green  

 Secondary: Blue, black, and red


All colors can make creature tokens. White and green, as the two main creature colors, do it most often. White tends to make smaller creature tokens, usually 1/1s, while green tends to make larger ones, from 3/3 and up. White often will make multiple tokens at once since they're smaller. Black most often makes 2/2 Zombies. Red most often makes 1/1 Goblins. Sometimes red's token creatures are a little bigger and get exiled at end of turn.




---

**Trample**


Primary: Green  

 Secondary: Red  

 Tertiary: White, blue, and black


Green is the main trample color, but red's share has been growing over time. Any color is allowed access to trample if the creature is large enough and of a higher rarity.




---

**"Transformation" (Target creature becomes a (color) (card type) with N power and N toughness.)**


Primary: Blue


Transformation can be temporary, through a one-shot spell that lasts for the turn, or more permanent, usually through an Aura. It overwrites the base power and toughness of the creature. This ability used to be in both blue and white, but we decided to focus it in blue. Sometimes blue can overwrite what the creature is currently doing and just make it the "transformed" creature. The one thing that we've taken from blue is destroying or exiling a creature and then giving the controller of that creature a creature token as a means of flavoring transformation. That is now a white ability flavored as giving compensation for destroying/exiling the creature. This means all of blue's transformation abilities are auras or limited effects on spells or activations.




---

**Treasure creation (artifact tokens with "T, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color.")**


Primary: Red  

 Secondary: Black and green  

 Tertiary: Blue


As the color of temporary mana, red is best at treasure creation. Black and green can both make treasure, but black tends to usually require some additional cost. Green historically has not had a lot of treasure making cards, but it's squarely in pie for green to do so. For flavor reasons, like Pirates, blue occasionally creates Treasure.




---

**"Torment" ability (Target player sacrifices a nonland permanent, pays 3 life, or discards a card.)**


Primary: Black


We've been playing around with an ability giving the opponent some options of what to pay. This ability is being used in black.




---

**"Tutoring" (Search your library for a card and put that card in your hand.)**


* **"Tutor" for any card.**

Primary: Black


*Limited Edition (Alpha)* had the card [Demonic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394025), which locked in black as the color to tutor for any type of card. There's been much talk over the years that blue seems philosophically the better color to have this ability, but so far no changes have been made.


* **"Tutor" for an artifact.**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: White


Blue can go get any type of artifact. White tends to focus on certain subsets such as Equipment and Vehicles.


* **"Tutor" for a creature.**

Primary: Green  

 Secondary: White, blue, black, and red


Green is the main color to tutor for creatures. Sometimes it will even put them directly onto the battlefield. All colors have access to tutoring for specific creature types that are in their color. Red, for example, can tutor for Dragons.


* **"Tutor" for an enchantment.**

Primary: White


White is the color that searches the library for enchantments.


* **"Tutor" for an instant or sorcery.**

Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: Red


When tutoring, the two spell types are often put together and blue seeks them out. We occasionally let red search out red instants and sorceries (usually to get things like direct damage spells).


* **"Tutor" for a land.**

Primary: Green  

 Tertiary: White, blue, black, and red


Green, being one of the colors most closely associated with land and mana, is the best at tutoring for land. It occasionally will put them directly onto the battlefield. The other four colors are allowed to occasionally tutor for their own basic land type. White is getting more tutoring for a Plains as a catch-up feature when it's behind on land.


* **"Tutor" for a planeswalker.**

Primary: White


White is the color that cares the most about planeswalkers, so it's the color that can tutor for them.


* **"Tutor" from top N cards of library.**

To cut down on shuffling, we've started to do more effects where you "tutor" just from a handful of cards from the top of your library, usually four or five. Anything else listed in this subsection that colors can do is what they can do here.




---

**"Twiddle" (Tap or untap target creature/permanent.)**


Primary: Blue


Ever since the card [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45235) appeared in *Limited Edition (Alpha)*, blue has had the ability to tap or untap permanents. It's most often used just on creatures. Blue doesn't tend to just tap or just untap, but rather give you the choice between the two. The one exception is "freezing" where it taps creatures and keeps them from untapping for a turn. (See **freezing**.)

**Untapping creatures** 


Primary: Green and blue  

 Secondary: White


Untapping creatures used to be white's domain, but we moved individual creature untapping off to green to give it more creature answers. White still can untap all your creatures or an individual creature on a spell that's defined as solely defensive. Blue's ability to untap is usually accompanied by its ability to also tap (see **twiddle** above).




---

**Untapping lands**


Primary: Green  

 Tertiary: Blue


Green, as the color most in tune with lands and acquiring mana, is the color that most often untaps lands. Blue does this a little.




---

**Untaps itself** 


Primary: Blue  

 Secondary: White


This is a creature that has an activated ability (or sometimes a triggered ability) that untaps itself. It's mostly used in blue, but occasionally in white when we want to simulate vigilance because actual vigilance is problematic due to timing.




---

**Vigilance**


Primary: White  

 Secondary: Blue and green


White tends to get this on creatures where the power is equal to or less than the toughness, and seldom with a power greater than 3. Green tends to get this ability on larger creatures to differentiate it from white. We've recently decided to also make blue secondary in vigilance because we were looking for more creature abilities to use in blue. We're still feeling out what kind of blue creatures will get vigilance.




---

**Variable Creature (This creature enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters.)**


Primary: Green  

 Tertiary: Black and red


This is a creature with an X in its cost determining how big it's going to be.




---

**Ward (for mana)**


Primary: White, blue, and green


Ward is a new evergreen ability. It makes any opponent who wishes to target the item with ward pay an additional cost. The most common way we use this is ward for mana, and that's in white, blue and green. It's in white because it's both the most protective and taxing color; and it's in blue and green, flavored as antimagic, in places where hexproof used to be.




---

**Ward (for life)**


Primary: Black and red


While white, blue, and green get to have ward using mana, black and red get to use it with a life payment instead. Black can also ward for discard.




---

**"Warlord" (This creature's power and toughness is equal to the number of creatures you control.)**


Primary: White  

 Secondary: Green


This ability started in red with [Keldon Warlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159262) in *Limited Edition (Alpha)*. We later moved it into green, as green is the creature color. The ability then got moved into white because white is the army color that likes giving rewards for having lots of little creatures. We still do the ability a little in green, but it's mostly in white these days.




---

**"Wheeling" (All players discard their hand and draw N cards.)**


Primary: Red


There's a big debate in R&D as to whether this is supposed to be a red ability. It obviously goes all the way back to *Limited Edition (Alpha)* with [Wheel of Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383151), but it's a raw form of card advantage that's supposed to be something red is bad at. For now, it stays in red's part of the color pie.




---

**Word Changing (Change a word in rules text into another word from the same subset.)**


Primary: Blue


This isn't an ability we do often any more, but it's blue when we do it. The most common use is changing a color word (white, blue, black, red, or green) for another color word or changing a basic land type (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest) for another basic land type.




---

**"You don't lose" (Permanents that prevent you from losing the game while they're on the battlefield, usually with an alternate means to lose.)**


Primary: Black  

 Secondary: White


This started with [Lich](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=69) in *Limited Edition (Alpha)* and has continued to be used on rare occasion. More recently, white has also started using this ability, often with the flavor of protecting the player.






Whew!

When I first made my original mechanical color pie article, I had no idea how big of a project it would become. I assumed updating it would be much simpler. That turned out not to be true. A big thanks to everyone on the Council of Colors for helping me with this Herculean task. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback about the mechanical color pie article as a player resource, so I'm happy I was able to update it.


As I said last time, if you see something missing or you think is incorrect, please let me know so I can fix it (or explain why it's correct). You can [email me](mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com) or contact me through any of my social media accounts ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/maro254), [Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mtgmaro), and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@markrosewater)).


Make sure to check out [today's associated article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/mechanical-color-pie-2021-changes-2021-10-18) where I go over the changes here in more detail.


Until then, may you have as much fun exploring the color pie as I do.
