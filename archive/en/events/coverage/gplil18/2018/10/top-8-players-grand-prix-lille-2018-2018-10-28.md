**Name:** Arne Huschenbeth


**Age:** 21


**Occupation:** *Magic*


**Hometown:** Berlin, Germany


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Four Grand Prix Top 8s.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Izzet Phoenix. It's good against Jeskai and Golgari, and we expected the winners' metagame to consist of mostly those archetypes.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Chart a Course](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chart+a+Course). It enables the deck.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Niv-Mizzet, Parun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+Parun). The card is absolutely insane in this deck. Thanks to Raul Porojan [who himself finished in 10th place with the deck] for the amazing testing.

Not sure. It's been so long.

Blue Obsession. I was doing decently with it and it was cheap to build.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Dive Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Down) because it's straight up the best card in Standard.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


The whole sideboard is a kind of trash, maybe Sleep.

Márcio told me to. [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) too strong.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) too strong.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


I played ten (!) mirror matches, so more Dinosaurs and [Find // Finality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Find+%2F%2F+Finality). Elves too strong!

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Chemister's Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chemister%27s+Insight). Provides card advantage, land drops, and allows you to cycle your bad cards. Really great against [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) too.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Niv-Mizzet, Parun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+Parun). Really hard to deal with and it's great to add another threat to close the game quickly.

[Niv-Mizzet, Parun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+Parun). It just won the game every time it was alive for a turn.

2018 World Champion.

[Jadelight Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jadelight+Ranger). It improves your stability.

**Name:** Alvaro Torrisco Jimenez


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Full-time *Magic*


**Hometown:** Malaga, Spain

Just two finals in RPTQ.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


I played Selesnya Tokens because I played more than a hundred leagues on *Magic Online* and had the best win rate with it.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Adanto Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adanto+Vanguard), because no one expects that card in a Selesnya Tokens main deck and it can easily turn a bad matchup like Jeskai into a good one.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Vivien Reid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivien+Reid) does all that I need, removal for [Lyra Dawnbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyra+Dawnbringer), removal for [Ixalan's Binding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ixalan%27s+Binding), and card advantage.
