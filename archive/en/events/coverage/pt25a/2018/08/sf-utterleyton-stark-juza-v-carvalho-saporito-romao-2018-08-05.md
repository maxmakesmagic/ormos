As the Pro Tour Team Series nears its conclusion, Hareruya Latin already has a commanding lead thanks to their finish here this weekend, but if ChannelFireball can both win their semifinals against Hareruya Latin *and* the subsequent finals match, they will overtake Ultimate Guard Pro Team in the standings to face Hareruya Latin the Team Series Championship in Vegas, part of the 2018 World Championship next month.


On the Legacy table, Utter-Leyton got off to a textbook start with his Blue-Black [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) deck, pressuring Carvalho's Death and Taxes deck immediately. However, Carvalho had played an [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) on the first turn and was able to use it sneak out his own creatures to keep up with Utter-Leyton and take advantage of the tendency of [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) decks to run their life total close to the wire. Carvalho put a [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) into play during Utter-Leyton's attack to not only fend off an 8/8 [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow), but also give him a weapons platform, as he equipped the [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) with a [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice) and sent it into Utter-Leyton's face to take Game 1.

Over on the Standard table, Jůza was already up a game over Romão within the first minute and took Game 2 quickly after that on back of [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent) and [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer).


Meanwhile in Modern, while Saporito's Humans deck is well suited to disrupt and pressure Stark's Ironworks Combo deck in Modern, it just didn't come together for Game 1, and Stark went through the motions to take the game.


Game 2 in Legacy played out very similarly to the first, but this time, Carvalho failed to have the [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp), and Utter-Layton's creatures finished off what they had started. Along the same lines, Saporito rattled off three quick wins against Stark to make up for losing Game 1 to be the first match finished in the semifinals.


As Romão and Jůza traded resources in Game 3, Jůza spent an [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration) on a [Rekindling Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rekindling+Phoenix), and then played [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance) and [Abrade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrade) to take out the Elemental remains. Romão spied an opening and ignored the planeswalker, attacking Jůza from 12 to 3 with [Cut // Ribbons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cut+%2F%2F+Ribbons) in the graveyard, and Jůza scooped them up.

Game 4 went much better for Jůza, who coughed up more threats than Romão could handle. Romão had the [Hour of Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Glory) for a [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer), but that allowed Jůza's [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent) to run rampant, ending the match in Jůza's favor 3-1.

Game 3 of Legacy got political, with Carvalho struggling under Utter-Leyton's [Dread of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+of+Night), but also becoming the monarch with [Palace Jailer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Jailer) and controlling the board with a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). Utter-Leyton fought back, eventually countering [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) with a [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) as Carvalho tried to replay it. With the [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) finally out of the way, Utter-Leyton took the throne and Carvalho could not recover.


Carvalho battled back in Game 4, again under the [Dread of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+of+Night), and he managed to stay on top of his monarchy while also locking out Utter-Leyton's [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope) with a [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker). The extra cards he tithed from his lofty position on the throne was enough to out-value Utter-Leyton and send them to the final deciding game of the series.


Game 5 started well for Utter-Leyton, who naturally flipped his [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) on turn two, before knocking a couple of lands out of Carvalho's hand with a [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach). Carvalho put up a heck of a fight, again becoming the Monarch to lock away a [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler). This time, Utter-Leyton was able to continually deploy threats he could use to steal the throne, taking the match and sending ChannelFireball to the Pro Tour 25th Anniversary finals!
