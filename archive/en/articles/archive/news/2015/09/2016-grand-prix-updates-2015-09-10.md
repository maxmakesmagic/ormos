Hélène Bergeot started her career with Wizards of the Coast in France in December, 1995; afterwards, she spent a few years in the European headquarters based in Belgium and eventually relocated to the Renton office. She is currently the director of organized play and trade marketing. 





A little over a month ago, at Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, we announced a number of improvements to the 2015–16 Premier Play season and revealed the schedule for 2016's Grand Prix. Since then, we have had to make some changes to that schedule. Today, we will also be revealing the modified prize structure for 2016's Grand Prix, which we briefly touched on in our previous announcement.


2016 Grand Prix Schedule Changes
================================


Since our initial announcement, we have had to shift a couple of dates and formats around for the 2016 Grand Prix schedule. You can find those changes below:

Grand Prix Milwaukee: Format changed to Limited


Grand Prix New York City: Date moved to May 6–8


Grand Prix Sydney: Date moved to July 29–31

In addition, the Grand Prix have been split into blocks that will qualify top finishers for a selected Pro Tour. Those date ranges are:

2016 Grand Prix Prize Structure Updates
=======================================


As mentioned in our announcement during Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, we have re-evaluated the current prize structure that exists for players who finish well at a Grand Prix. After careful consideration, we determined that the prize money awarded to the Top 4 finishers of a Grand Prix does not accurately reflect the difficulty in reaching that stage of a tournament.


The revised prize structure places more of the prize money awarded at Grand Prix to the top finishers, with the winner of an individual Grand Prix now slated to take home $10,000USD starting in 2016.


Below are the revised prize structures for individual and team Grand Prix in 2016, based on the number of players. No changes to Professional Point payouts have occurred.


**Individual Grand Prix**




| **Place** | **0–2,999** | **3,000+** |
| 1 | $10,000 | $10,000 |
| 2 | $5,000 | $5,000 |
| 3–4 | $2,500 | $2,500 |
| 5–8 | $1,500 | $1,500 |
| 9–16 | $1,000 | $1,000 |
| 17–32 | $500 | $500 |
| 33–64 | $250 | $250 |
| 65–100 | n/a | $250 |
| 101–180 | n/a | $200 |

**Team Grand Prix (prize payouts per team)**




| **Place** | **0–999** | **1,000+** |
| 1 | $15,000 | $15,000 |
| 2 | $7,500 | $7,500 |
| 3–4 | $3,750 | $3,750 |
| 5–8 | $2,100 | $2,100 |
| 9–12 | $1,800 | $1,800 |
| 13–16 | $1,500 | $1,500 |
| 17–20 | $1,200 | $1,200 |
| 21–24 | $900 | $900 |
| 25–30 | n/a | $900 |
| 31–42 | n/a | $750 |
| 43–58 | n/a | $600 |

As always, we strive to bring the community a positive, memorable experience at our Grand Prix, and we aim to both listen to and address appropriate feedback as quickly and professionally as we can.
