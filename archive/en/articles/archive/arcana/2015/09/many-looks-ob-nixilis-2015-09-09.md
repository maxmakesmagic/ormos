One of the coolest cards to come out of previews so far is Ob Nixilis Reignited. And I don't mean "cool" as in powerful or that it'll see Standard play—although both are probably true—I mean cool in that it builds on a story that's been happening on the periphery for years now.

Ob Nixilis, as you might know, has had many forms over the years, and if you've played *Magic Duels* in the past, you might have even played out some of his story. But what's really cool is that you can now play decks that include his entire transformative process, from human Planeswalker, to de-winged Demon, all the way to terrifying Demon Planeswalker!


**Pre-Transformation**

Color: Black  



This was the most recent version of Ob Nixilis we'd seen prior to *Battle for Zendikar*, but, chronologically, it's his earliest known form. Prior to the Demon we've come to associate with Zendikar, Ob Nixilis was a full-fledged Planeswalker of the Human variety—and a pretty terrifying one at that.


**Demon, Minus the Wings**

Color: Black creature  

Location: Swamp environment  

Action: This is a unique, nonflying Demon character (see bio below). The creeping roots of his swamp surroundings have wound around him and have actually grown under his skin, giving him a veiny, tattooed appearance. Show him brooding with hate and malice, a badass Demon lord (again, no wings). He's not from this world, so keep his design different from the Demon in the style guide.  

Bio: Ob Nixilis is a cruel Demon who was once a Planeswalker. He was tempted by the powerful mana of this world, but the world fought back, fracturing part of his soul and leaving him stranded on the plane. Now, bitter and spiteful, he schemes for a way to restore his power and escape the plane.  

Focus: The Demon  

Mood: He won't hesitate to destroy anything that doesn't help him escape this world.


The first version of Ob Nixilis printed was when he was at, essentially, his "lowest" (though being a terrifying Demon is hardly a low point). Stripped of his ability to planeswalk and with his wings clipped, Ob Nixilis was stuck firmly on Zendikar.


**Now with Wings**

Setting: Zendikar  

Color: Black legendary creature  

Location: Guul Draz, Zendikar  

Action: Show the Demon Ob Nixilis. He is in his 2.0 state, which means he is more powerful, has wings, and no longer has the hedron-shaped cross in his forehead. He looks at us like a starving tiger would look at a helpless fawn.  

Focus: Ob Nixilis  

Mood: Epic. The badass of all Demons.


The story of how Ob Nixilis had his hedron removed was part of last year's *Duels of the Planeswalkers* story. At this point, he's got his wings but he still lacks the ability to planeswalk.


**Reignited and It Feels So Good**

Setting: Zendikar  

Color: Black planeswalker  

Location: Your choice  

Action: This is the glamour shot of the winged Demon Planeswalker Ob Nixilis. He's standing on top of a floating hedron, reveling in a moment of triumph.  

Focus: Ob Nixilis  

Mood: Evil, sadistic, dangerous.  

Background: Ob Nixilis spent millennia robbed of his ability to planeswalk and trapped on Zendikar. He has just regained his planeswalker spark by **REDACTED**.


Which brings us to today and the planeswalking Demon you see before you. How did Ob Nixilis regain his spark? Stay tuned to find out!
