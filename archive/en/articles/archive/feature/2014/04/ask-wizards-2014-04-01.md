Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!


**Q: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?** 


**A: Mike McArtor, copy editor of DailyMTG.com:**


It depends on what you mean by "first."


The first card with [Egg in the name](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Begg%5D) is [Dingus Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=12), from Alpha. The first card with [Chicken in the name](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Bchicken%5D) appeared in *Unglued*.


Alphabetically, of course, a Chicken card comes first. In this case, [Chicken Ã  la King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chicken+%C3%A0+la+King).


And if you're looking for "eggs" for your deck, I recommend the winning decklists from [Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/pro-tour-return-ravnica-top-8-modern-2012-10-20) (Cifka's) and [Grand Prix San Diego](/en/events/coverage/holiday-serves-eggs-gp-san-diego) (Holiday's).
