**PT–Austin Video Contest Winners!**


You might recall that a little over a week ago, the Arcana slot hosted an [announcement](/en/articles/archive/pro-tour%E2%80%93austin-video-contest-2009-10-12) about a video contest at Pro Tour–Austin. Well, the Pro Tour is over, the [coverage](/en/events/coverage/kibler-completes-comeback-austin-victory) is up, and Brian Kibler has walked away with his giant novelty check. What about the video contest? How good of you to ask!


Our crack team of judges selected three finalists from the pool of videos submitted at Austin. Here's **Magic** head designer and **magicthegathering.com** columnist Mark Rosewater—a former television writer, by the way—reviewing the top three videos:
