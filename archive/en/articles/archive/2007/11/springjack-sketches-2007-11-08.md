The kithkin, elves, and giants of Lorwyn have all domesticated creatures for use as mounts. The elves use [Nath of the Gilt-Leaf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nath%2Bof%2Bthe%2BGilt-Leaf); giants use [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Cloudgoat%2BRanger).


The kithkin rely on the springjack, a creature that has characteristics of goats, sheep, and rabbits. The springjack's wool is useful, its milk and meat is nourishing, and its gait is speedy. It's the perfect all-around beast of burden for Lorwyn's kithkin.


Here's are some sketch by artist Larry MacDougall that eventually became Knight of Meadowgrain.

[Springjack Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Knight) shows a head-on perspective of the springjack, which helps show how its back legs come forward as it moves. A springjack doesn't gallop like a horse; its gait is more of a bounding motion, like a hare. Kithkin knights certainly appreciate the saddle-maker's craft.

[Epic Proportions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epic+Proportions) shows what happens when you apply a significant amount of fierce, primal growth magic to one of those swift springjacks. Hold on, little kithkin!
