You might have noticed [that Collector Boosters can contain "one card from . . . Theme Boosters,"](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/theros-beyond-death-collector-booster-contents-2019-12-13) which is a bit new and different since Theme Boosters have, in the past, merely been collections of cards in the main set.


Moving forward, Theme Boosters are going to contain unique rares aimed at newer players looking to collect cards in that specific theme. For *Theros Beyond Death*, we're sticking with Theme Boosters based on colorsâ€”but who knows what themes we could roll out in the future!


Each Theme Booster will come with 35 cards from *Theros Beyond Death*, all from the same color, including one rare or mythic rare card. Those rare or mythic rares can be a card from the set or one of these unique Theme Booster rares:
