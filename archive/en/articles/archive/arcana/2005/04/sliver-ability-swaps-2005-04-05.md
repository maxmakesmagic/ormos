The [*Legions* slivers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=sliver&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Legions&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=43&y=17) took a lot of tinkering to reach their final forms -- they spent a lot of time on the Riptide Project drawing board, as it were. 

[Blade Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Blade%2BSliver)In most cases, the slivers' art corresponds in some way to its ability. For example, [Blade Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Sliver), which pumps slivers' offensive capabilities, has two claws instead of one.

[Crypt Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crypt%2BSliver)But many of the slivers' abilities were still being hammered out *after* their art was commissioned. For example, the oily form of [Crypt Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Sliver) originally had a [Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear)-like evasion ability. The art was originally intended to show a sliver that could dive down into the muck to avoid being seen. During development, [Crypt Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Sliver)'s ability was seen as redundant with [Shifting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shifting+Sliver)'s near-unblockability, so was changed to a regeneration ability.

[Hunter Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hunter%2BSliver)
[Hunter Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunter+Sliver) was originally slated to have another difficult-to-block ability, similar to [Goblin War Drums](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Drums) or [Vine Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Kami). It has two heads, which originally was meant to indicate its ability to engage multiple blockers. Its ability was swapped out for first strike and then eventually to *Legions'* new provoke mechanic.
