During Grand Prix Prague on January 12, 2019, *Magic* Pro League (MPL) member [Rei Sato was disqualified](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppra19/statement-regarding-rei-sato-disqualification-2019-01-12). His infraction and subsequent disqualification was referred to the Player Investigations Committee for review.


After a thorough review of the events leading up to his disqualification, the Player Investigations Committee determined that Sato's disqualification was valid, that the actions were opportunistic, but not premeditated nor intended to deceive his opponent. The Player Investigation Committee recommended an official warning; Sato will not be suspended from the DCI.


That said, players in the MPL are held to a higher standard in both play and conduct. Therefore, the MPL has revoked Sato's invitation to the $1 million Mythic Invitational at PAX East.
