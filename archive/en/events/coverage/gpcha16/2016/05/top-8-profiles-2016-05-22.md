### Jack Wang


**Hometown:** Philiadelphia, PA


**Occupation:** Scientist


**Record:** 13-1-1


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Four-Color [Bring to Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bring+to+Light) [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). It’s lit.


**What’s the most interesting deck you played against this weekend?**  

A dank Bant Company brew.


**In your opinion, what’s the most underrated card in Modern? Your Favorite? Why?**  
[Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare). [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). Blue too Stronk.

### Adonnys Medrano


**Hometown:** Burke, Virginia


**Occupation:** Student


**Record:** 13-1-1


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Jund. Jund lyfe is best lyfe.


**What’s the most interesting deck you played against this weekend?**  

Got ruined by Goblins because of [Goblin Grenade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Grenade). So probably that.


In your opinion, what’s the most underrated card in Modern? Your Favorite? Why?  

Night of Soul’s [Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal), silver bullet against tons of decks. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), one of the most powerful cards in Modern.

### Andreas Ganz


**Hometown:** Zurich, Switzerland


**Occupation:** Content Manager


**Record:** 13-2


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Ad Nauseam. It’s well-positioned against the field (except for Infect), favored vs Jeskai Harbinger, and people aren’t prepared for the deck/don’t know it.


**What’s the most interesting deck you played against this weekend?**  

Bant Eldrazi, most other decks I faced were stock tier 1 decks.


**In your opinion, what’s the most underrated card in Modern? Your Favorite? Why?**  

I don’t think there is really a single underrated card in a format as wide as Modern. If anything, there are underrated archetypes. As far as underrated decks go, I would say Green White Death and Taxes.

### Sam Black


**Hometown:** Madison, WI


**Occupation:** pro player/writer for StarCityGames.com


**Record:** 13-1-1


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Death’s Shadow - I watched Magnus Lantto win a lot on Magic Online


**What’s the most interesting deck you played against this weekend?**  

Bant Eldrazi


**In your opinion, what’s the most underrated card in Modern? Your favorite? Why?**  
[Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) - it ends games easily  
[Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) - history

### Eli Kassis


**Hometown:** Vestal, NY


**Occupation:** licensed mental health counselor


**Record:** 13-1-1


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Nightshade, it has lots of play and people don’t expect it.


**What’s the most interesting deck you played against this weekend?**  

Merfolk.


**In your opinion, what’s the most underrated card in Modern? Your favorite? Why?**  
[Retreat to Coralhelm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retreat+to+Coralhelm), Nahiri - powerful and versatile

### Mike Sigrist


**Hometown:** Foxboro, MA


**Occupation:** professional Magic player


**Record:** 13-2


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Jund. Couldn’t find a deck that was more consistent.


**What’s the most interesting deck you played against this weekend?**  

Bant Eldrazi. [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) seemed good in it as well.


**In your opinion, what’s the most underrated card in Modern? Your favorite? Why?**  
[Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). It can take over games on its own and it’s not in any decks but Jund.  
[Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) is my favorite card in Modern. It was in my favorite deck, I don’t care if the deck doesn’t function anymore.

### Jon Bolding


**Hometown:** Raleigh, N.C.


**Occupation:** property manager


**Record:** 13-2


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Company Zoo - it’s the deck I know the best and familiarity is extremely important in Modern


**What’s the most interesting deck you played against this weekend?**  

Jund splashing white for Nahiri and [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls)


**In your opinion, what’s the most underrated card in Modern? Your favorite? Why?**  
[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) - it’s naturally strong against a lot of archetypes.  
[Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) - it’s the most versatile removal in Modern
