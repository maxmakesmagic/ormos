It’s “The Past Returns” Week on **magicthegathering.com**, so of course we have to say a little bit about this card:

![Blast from the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blast+from+the+Past)Although it’s an *Unhinged* card, the card’s concept revolves around a *Time-Spiral*-like return to the past in just about every way possible on a **Magic** card. It has the old card face (now new again thanks to the *Time Spiral* timeshifted cards), old mechanics such as madness, cycling, and buyback (now new again thanks to *Time Spiral*), the old tombstone icon (this is truly a sign of the past now—the icon was *not* revived in *Time Spiral*), and even an old-school **Magic** artist in [Douglas Shuler](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/IndexV2.aspx?term=douglas%20shuler&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=All%20sets).

*Blast from the Past art by Douglas Shuler*
Note that Doug’s name was intentionally, lovingly misspelled “Schuler” on Blast from the Past to revive yet another part of **Magic’s** past—the unfortunate accidental misspelling of his name on several [Alpha cards](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/IndexV2.aspx?term=douglas%20schuler&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=All%20sets). Poor Mr. Shuler! What a good sport!

Note also that the goblin in the art of [Blast from the Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blast+from+the+Past) is seen riding *Unhinged’s* [Time Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Machine). That [Time Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Machine) ultimately crashes in the art of another *Unhinged* throwback, [Old Fogey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Old+Fogey) (also a Shuler/“Schuler” card), a creature with banding, phasing, rampage, and protection from [Viscerid Deepwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Viscerid%2BDeepwalker). Summon Dinosaur, indeed (not you, Doug!).
