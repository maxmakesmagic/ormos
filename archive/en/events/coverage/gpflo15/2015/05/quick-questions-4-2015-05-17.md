Early on Saturday, we took to Twitter and asked people for suggestions for quick questions we could ask the pros at this Grand Prix. The yield wasn't particularly big, but a certain someone came up with a question that really intrigued us.

Here is what our pros came up with ...

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpflo15/GPFLO15_qq_duke.jpg)** [Took some time to run some calculations in his head ...] "64.8% of the time!" [Which is a hundred percent correct.]

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpflo15/GPFLO15_qq_juza.jpg)** [Making a wild guess ...] "83.6%!"

 Eduardo Sajgalik, Top 8 at Grand Prix Milan 2015:**  [Pulled out his notepad, started crunching the numbers, and came up with ...] "64.8%!"

 Valentin Mackl, five Grand Prix Top 8s:**  "I don't care. It's over 60%!"

 Wenzel Krautmann, champion of Grand Prix Warsaw 2013:**  "I'm a lawyer, not a mathematician! I don't know this stuff."

 Now you might be interested in a somewhat longer answer, like how to work out the result yourself. We can help you there. When doing probability calculations, there are three simple—well, *simplish*—rules one needs to keep in mind:



1. "And" means multiplication. The probability that both thing A *and* thing B will happen, if they are independent, is the probability of A *times* the probability of B.
2. "Or" means addition. The probability that A *or* B will happen, if they are exclusive, is the probability of A *plus* the probability B.
3. Very important: You need to account for *all* of the possible combinations that lead to the outcome in question.


 Now onto the problem at hand! The answer could be given in the following form: It's the probability that your team wins the first *and* the second *and* the third match, *or* wins the first *and* the second match *and* loses the third, *or* wins the first *and* the third match *and* loses the second, *or* wins the second *and* the third match *and* loses the first.



Translating that into a formula by simply turning every "and" into a multiplication and exchanging every "or" for a plus sign, we get:


0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 + 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.4 + 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.4 + 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.4 = 0.648
