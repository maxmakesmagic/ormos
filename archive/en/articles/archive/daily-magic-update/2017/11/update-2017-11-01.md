The November 1, 2017 Update
===========================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 1, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by old fogeys.


Today's Must (for Old People Like Myself)
=========================================


1. [Spedternal Weekend 2017: An Old School Tournament Report](http://www.eternalcentral.com/spedternal-weekend-2017-an-old-school-tournament-report/) | Eternal Central | Bryan Manolakos

An old-school tournament report for an Old School tournament. Posted yesterday, a number of long-time players gushed about the report, and I (another long-time player) have to agree. It's fun, it's nostalgic, and it's a relic of another time. Kind of like Old School itself.


Also, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
=====================================


1. [Hareruya Girls -A New Challenge of Hareruya-](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/208) | Hareruya English

Hareruya has launched a number of programs to support *Magic* players around the world for a variety of reasons. Their next mission is to encourage women playing *Magic* with a program that's kicking off with two sponsored women, both international content creators and both featured in the article.


1. [Two and a Half *Ixalan* Cards You Should Be Playing](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikeflores-11012017-two-and-a-half-ixalan-cards-you-should-be-playing/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Flores

You have to love Mike-isms like playing "half" a card, but the point stands. Also, he gives some interesting thoughts on Standard and what *could* be good.


1. [Pro Tour Team Series 2017–18 (Team MTG Mint Card)](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/mtg-mint-card/pro-tour-team-series-2017-18-team-mtg-mint-card) | MTG Mint Card

As we near Pro Tour *Ixalan*, teams are starting to step more and more out into the spotlight. We'll certainly be featuring them this weekend. So get an early jump on coverage and check out MTG Mint Card, one of the teams everyone will be watching this season.


1. [Vona, Butcher of Magan](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2017/11/01/e114-vona-butcher-of-magan.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Sean Whatson, and Shivam Bhatt

Bite into a succulent new [Vona, Butcher of Magan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vona%2C+Butcher+of+Magan) Commander deck with the Commanderin' crew. Then feel a little bad about all the Vampire puns you're sure to use when you play the deck.


1. [Possibility Storm #6: *Ixalan*](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/possibility-storm-6-ixalan) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

For those who don't know, Possibility Storm was a Facebook/shoestrings sort of puzzle that has since moved to MTGGoldfish, where it confounds readers regularly. This week's puzzle is a good starting point for people, as it's actually relatively simple to solve, compared to some of the head-scratchers this feature is capable of.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Magic Mics | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://go.twitch.tv/magicmics) | 8 p.m. PT/11 p.m. ET/3 a.m. UTC | Reuben Bresler, Evan Erwin, and Erin Campbell

It's been kind of a slow news week. Sure, two promo cards from *Rivals of Ixalan* were previewed, but there's been very little drama, little for the community to be up in arms about, and . . .


. . . I've just jinxed it, haven't I?


Top 25
======


1. We have a new No. 1

While we've all been paying attention (rightfully so) to William Jensen's tear through the Grand Prix circuit, Reid Duke has quietly been putting up similar results.


Not so quiet now.


Thanks to his 2nd-place finish this past weekend, Duke vaulted over Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa to take sole possession of No. 1 on the Top 25 rankings. Meanwhile, Peach Garden Oath teammate Owen Turtenwald jumped two spots to No. 7, and both Christian Calcano and Brian Braun-Duin leapt up 5 spots.


But all of that is just math. Our new No. 1, Reid Duke, has ascended. Long may he reign.

A little Lévy is on their way! Congrats, Raph and Monica. That means, of course, no Pro Tour for the Hall of Fame pro. But November is a solid month to have a birthday. Solid month.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Anointed Embalm](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-10-31)

[Vizier of the Anointed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+the+Anointed) was always a really fun draft-around-me sort of card, but at no point has anyone thought the deck would make the leap to Constructed. Yet, here we are, with a 5-0 Standard League list from *Magic Online* player Huetti, who is packing a whopping four of them, all ready to make cantriping [Sacred Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Cat)s.


Also, seriously, [Sacred Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Cat) is a subtle Standard MVP. That card just does so much work.


At any rate, the deck continues the trend of players playing around with [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession), and even goes deep in the sideboard for the Procession mirror with the oft-forgotten [Fragmentize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fragmentize).


Whether this deck has legs or not, doubling up on [Champion of Wits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+of+Wits) eternalize is basically everything I want in life that isn't [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon)/[Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer), so I'm sold.
