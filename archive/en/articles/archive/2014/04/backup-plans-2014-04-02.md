I don't think it's unfair to say that Patrick Dickmann's "Tempo [Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twin)" resembles Shouta Yasooka's Eternal Command, just with the [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo spliced in. Following [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptbng14/welcome) and [Grand Prix Richmond](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gprich14/welcome), Dickmann's deck was widely considered one of the best decks in the format, if not *the* best. The running joke was that Dickmann's deck rarely comboed, so why bother running it in the first place? Why not make the backup plan, which has proven to be successful, the main plan and fill out the deck with ways to supplement that plan?

Two reasons. The first is that everyone must respect turn-three [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) into turn-four [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). It will cause your opponents to play overly cautious and potentially save their removal for your potential combo despite them getting beaten down by a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). The second reason is that your opponents will often over-sideboard against your combo, diluting their decks against your backup plan.


Of course, as players become more familiar with Dickmann's deck, you might lose those edges when they figure out how to actually fight you. In that case, you might want to take a look at TirioNstaRz10's Eternal Command deck. With [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial), [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image), and the full four [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)s, this deck is incredibly robust. Sometimes, a backup plan ends up being better than your main plan.
