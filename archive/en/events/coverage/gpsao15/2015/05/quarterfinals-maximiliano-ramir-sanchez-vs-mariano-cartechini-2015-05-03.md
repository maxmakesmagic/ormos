**Game 1**



Sanchez had a pretty brutal start and it would seem like Cartechini had little chance of ever winning that one. Sanchez had earned the right to begin the match owing to his superior Swiss standings and led with Elvish Mystic.

He then followed that up with double [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) and topped it off with Stormbreath Dragon, ending the game as quickly as it started.

**Game 2**



Cartechini led with the [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and Rakshasa Deathdealer, a decent start for the Abzan player. Sanchez, however, killed both of them with Draconic Roar and Wild Slash.



Now that the coast was clear, [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) and [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) could attack unopposed. They got in for six damage, and then six more. Soon, Cartechini was down to just six life.



Sanchez attempted a lethal Crater's Claws, but Cartechini responded with [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) on Boon Satyr. This allowed him to stay alive for one more turn to add [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) to the board.



That was inconsequential though, because Sanchez booked his seat in the semifinals with the help of double Stormbreath Dragon.
