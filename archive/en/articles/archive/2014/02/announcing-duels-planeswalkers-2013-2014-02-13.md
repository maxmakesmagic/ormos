Announcing Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013
==========================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on April 6, 2012 










As you may already be aware, PAX East is about to happen. It might even be happening right now, depending on when you read this! And that means we finally get to announce something we're pretty excited about: **Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013**.

Here's why we're excited about this:


1. **iPad**: This summer, in addition to XBox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC, **Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013** is going to be available on iPad!
2. **Planechase**: Not only is Wizards of the Coast coming out with four new [*Planechase* decks](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/848) on June 1 (which introduce the new Phenomenon card type), but you'll be able to play *Planechase* multiplayer games in **Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013**!
3. **Optional Manual Tapping of Lands**: Although **Duels of the Planeswalkers** is mostly for people who are new to **Magic**, it's a lot of fun for people who have been playing **Magic** long enough to know what's what. So for **Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013**, you can turn on an option to let you choose exactly which lands to tap!
4. **New Decks; New Challenges**: Naturally, a new **Duels of the Planeswalkers** means new decks to battle with and new puzzles to solve.
5. **Meet the New Boss**: The final battle in **Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013** is someone you might recognize. Say hello to Magic’s ultimate evil mastermind, dragon Planeswalker **Nicol Bolas**!
