It's almost November, so it's time to announce the promos that Friday Night *Magic* players can look forward to over the next three months. They are shiny, and soon they can all be yours.


**November**


Well that's justâ€”just horrifying. I know *Eldritch Moon* and *Shadows over Innistrad* were all about horror but, this is madness...


...oh, I get it. Yeah, this one features an Angel doing something wholly terrifying. But that was the point, wasn't it, Eric Deschamps?

**December**


If you happened to pick up one of those terrifying [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper)s, this is a pretty effective way to madness it out. And 1/1 lifelink Vampires, to boot!

**January**


Speaking of effective ways to utilize madness, [Noose Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor) is one of the better ones around. This [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) update has been used in a number of powerful tournament decks to block fliers, put cards in the graveyard, and just generally serve as a menacing Snake.
