Known Issues List
-----------------






The following is a list of known issues on *Magic Online*. Our goal with the known issues list is to give players insight into what we're working on, as well as helping players avoid problematic bugs and performance issues.


Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of known issues; it simply contains the ones that we feel players are most likely to encounter. If you're curious behind the specific rationale of which issues are included, we talk a little bit more about it [here](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/139554007099/brandon-and-the-bug-blog#notes).


[REPORT A BUG](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-report-an-issue)



The *Magic Online* known issues list is divided up into several categories.


Client and Gameplay known issues are based around the client and broad mechanical interactions.

You can search the below table by keyword, or click each header to sort alphabetically.


**Categories:** Collection, Deck Building, Duel Scene, General, Leagues, Play Lobby, and Trade.


Cardset known issues are based around specific cards or groups of cards that are not working as intended.

| Ongoing | Casting a second copy of [Gideon's Intervention](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Intervention) causes the first to become non-functional, allowing the named card to be cast and deal damage. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Thornbow Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbow+Archer) is incorrectly granting 1 life to opponents that do not control an Elf, rather than causing them to lose 1 life. | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | Selecting yes to anything other than artifacts with two [Storage Matrices](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15260) in play causes the game to soft lock. | Cardset (Modern) |

| Ongoing | Casting [Whims of the Fates](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whims+of+the+Fates) causes a game crash. | Cardset (Modern, Commander) |
| Ongoing | Cards exiled by the triggered abilities of a number of cards which exile a card from their controller's library appear to be coming from the opponent's library instead. This affects cards such as [Bomat Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier), [Windbrisk Heights](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Heights), and other similar cards.

| Ongoing | Creatures that have been affected by the goad ability from all opponents are unable to attack any opponent. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | In rare cases, deleted binders continue to appear in the binders list. Collapsing and reopening the Binders section will remove deleted binders. | Trade |
| Ongoing | Abilities of objects that have changed color incorrectly display descriptive text indicating the changed color while on the stack | Duel Scene |

| Ongoing | Player who get disconnected with an open chat window will find that every message in that window will appear to have been sent by the other player. | General |
| Ongoing | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. | Cardset (Pauper) |
| Ongoing | If a token creature stops being blocked (perhaps because all blocking creatures were destroyed), it will return to a pile with other identical tokens if any are present. Once there, the game log is the only way to identify which creature was blocked. To identify this creature, players can point their cursor to the name of the token in the game log entry that identifies the attacking creatures and locate the creature that no longer has a blocking creature associated with it. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Some cards with the madness ability do not display the correct reminder text. Notably, this includes [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | [Odric, Lunarch Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Lunarch+Marshal)'s triggered ability ignores the hexproof ability on a creature if it only has it temporarily. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | When some cards with madness are discarded, the triggered ability does not display the madness cost while on the stack. Players can find this information by right-clicking the card or by viewing the game log. | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | Abilities that trigger from a permanent becoming the target of a spell or ability (such as that of [Silverfur Partisan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)) are not triggered by copies of spells automatically put onto the stack. For example: if a player controls [Zada, Hedron Grinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zada%2C+Hedron+Grinder) and casts a spell on Zada, when Zada's triggered ability resolves, the player will be prompted to choose targets for the copies made by Zada. If the player chooses targets for the copies individually, [Silverfur Partisan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)'s ability will trigger correctly. If the player clicks OK to automatically choose the targets, the Partisan's ability won't trigger. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Fork in the Road](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork+in+the+Road) fails to display the destination zones of the chosen lands in the game log. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Infectious Curse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infectious+Curse) provides no indication as to which player has been cursed. | Cardset (Standard) |

| Ongoing | [Ever After](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ever+After) resolves immediately upon selection of the second target instead of allowing the player to click a "Done" button. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Narset, Enlightened Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master)'s triggered ability does not allow players to cast split spells (such as [Fire // Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+%2F%2F+Ice)). | Cardset (Commander, Modern) |
| Ongoing | [Eldrazi Spawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Spawn) and Scions created by cards from the Battle for Zendikar and Rise of the Eldrazi sets display "Add {1} to your mana pool" instead of "Add {C} to your mana pool" upon zoom. As this change in template was not a functional change, these tokens continue to function correctly. | Cardset (Standard, Modern) |
