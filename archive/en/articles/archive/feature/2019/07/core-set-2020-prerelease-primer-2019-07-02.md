 When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he dreamt of a job making Magic cards—and now as a Magic designer, he's living his dream! Gavin has been writing about Magic since 2005. 






Old favorites. New pals. Lots of Chandra in your face everywhere. That can only mean one thing: it's time for *Core Set 2020*!


Whether you're new to slinging spells or a seasoned Planeswalker, this set is a great one to dive into. We always make sure that our core sets are the best time to start learning *Magic* and also have plenty of scintillating new cards for plenty of decks.


And, as always, there's one destination to see all this goodness before anybody else—the Prerelease!


Whether it's your first Prerelease or your hundredth, it's a great time to come check out the set. Plus, you get to play with the cards before anybody else!


So, what can you expect to have happen at a Prerelease? Read on!


*Core* Concepts
===============


Prereleases are my favorite *Magic* events of the year.


No matter where in the world I am or what time of year it is, I always try to go check out a local Prerelease. And I'm not alone: tons of *Magic* players, from seasoned veterans to folks just starting out, do the same! Prereleases are among the most popular events we throw.


Why? Because Prereleases are just some of the most fun you can have playing *Magic*!


There's nothing quite like it. You get to sit down, pick up some brand-new cards, and figure out how you want to use them at the same time everybody else is. It's an even playing field in a casual environment, where everybody shares all that bubbling energy and excitement around a new *Magic* set!


I visited my first Prerelease when I was just eleven and instantly fell in love with the event. Eighteen years later, not too much has changed—and Prereleases are better than ever!


Prereleases are great because the set is totally new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's just a lot of fun for old and new players alike!


If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section, where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for *Core Set 2020*. But if you're new to the wide world of Sealed Deck, or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, read on!


All right. So, let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?


If you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the [store locator](https://locator.wizards.com/) to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check and see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly *not* when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to plan ahead.


Have you found your store? Excellent!


Now it's time to look ahead and prepare for the event. While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do besides just that.


Be sure to pack all the supplies you will need for this journey. For example, you may still want to bring a Standard deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle.


A Prerelease event tends to take about 4–5 hours, so make sure to set aside enough time for the entire event. And you're going to need some fuel with all of that battling, so you may want to bring something like a protein bar, apple (so appropriate—they have cores!), or other snack.


Okay now, let's see. You have a store selected on your map, and you've filled your pack with everything you'll need. And, of course, you've taken a look at all the awesome cards in the [*Core Set 2020* Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/core-set-2020). Perhaps, if you were curious what a tournament might be like, you might have checked out my article conveniently titled "[Your First Tournament](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/your-first-tournament-2017-02-23)."


You're all set! Now it's time to actually go and open up some of those cards!


*Core* of Your Deck
===================


Okay. So, you're going to sit down and play. What can you expect to get?


Everyone will get a box that looks like this:


![Prerelease box](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/YQPCq3JnW8.png)


Inside, you'll get six *Core Set 2020* boosters, plus a random stamped rare or mythic rare card as your Prerelease foil that could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!


Then, of course, you'll get a couple other goodies, like a spindown life counter to keep track of your life total. Let's just crack one open and take a look!


![Everything inside](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/FXLChmcGoe.png)


Excellent! Plenty of the supplies you need.


And, of course, front and center are those booster packs. Let's talk about what to do with those next!


First things first: crack open those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.


So . . . what now?


It's time to build your deck, of course!


Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck using only the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.


The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors. You can sometimes "splash" for a third color, but, in general, you'll at least want to pick two to be your core.


Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:


* A really strong rare you're excited about
* Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures
* A lot of playable cards in that color
* A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs

Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four of these criteria, but if two or three of those are true, that's plenty good.


Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease; everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!)


Now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?


Here's one process that may help!


First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially be able to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a [Daybreak Chaplain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Chaplain) on turn two, whereas [Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) isn't usually a turn-two play.)


A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:


* 1 mana: 0–2
* 2 mana: 4–6
* 3 mana: 3–5
* 4 mana: 2–4
* 5 mana 1–3
* 6+ mana: 0–2

![Mana Curve](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/BB20170525_New-curve.png)


That's far from set in stone, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.


Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.


The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight up destroying them. Sealed Deck *Magic* is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.


If you want to learn more about mana curves, you can also check out my article on how to build a mana curve by clicking [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/how-build-mana-curve-2017-05-18).


Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:


* You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if possible. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!
* The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and, in general, it's what I would want to have.
* Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. If you have all large, expensive creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting-cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.
* Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these stalls.
* Unlike most *Magic* formats, Sealed tends to be a little slower. If your deck is on the slow side, choosing to draw (go second) rather than play (go first) can be reasonable to give you that extra card.

Two-Headed Giant
================


Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG"), where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which the players build their decks. (If you've had a chance to try out the *Battlebond* set from last year, you may already be familiar!)


How does it work?


Well, the simple version is this: you and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.


How does this kind of multiplayer play out? It's simple: all of your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.

Open Dueling
============


If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play *Magic*, or if you have less time and just want to battle as you're available, you can get involved in Open Dueling!


You get a ready-to-play 60-card Planeswalker Deck and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds. This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit 5 hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!


Not to mention, *Core Set 2020* has five different Planeswalker Decks to pick between—there's so much variety! Check them out!


![PW decks](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/dlzY8YKOqJ.png)


Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!


More Core
=========


Want more of the core set? Well, good news! Something relatively new to Prerelease is the ability to actually pick up a booster box at the Prerelease!


That's right: if you preorder a box ahead of time, you can actually buy your box and bring it home (or crack it all open there!) right away. Contact your local store for more details.


Similarly, you can also buy Planeswalker Decks on Prerelease day as well! Open dueling or no, feel free to pick up a deck and get to battling.


Foresight Is *2020*
===================


There has never been a better time to enter *Magic*. With a brand-new core set around the corner [*Magic: The Gathering Arena*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) bringing people into the game, and tons of stores at which you can play, there are plenty of opportunities to play *Magic* everywhere!


If you're new, welcome on in. If you've been around for a while, welcome back. It's gonna be a good time!


So, gather up your friends, take another look through the [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/core-set-2020), make sure you're preregistered at your local store, and get ready to come out to the Prerelease and have fun!
