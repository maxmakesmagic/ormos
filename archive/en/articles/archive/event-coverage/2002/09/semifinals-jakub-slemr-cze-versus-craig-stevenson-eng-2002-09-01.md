![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/884.jpg)This match-up is probably in Jakub’s favor, especially after sideboarding since Craig has no way of dealing with the [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest), but he showed that anything can happen in this game by defeating Christophe Haim in the quarter-finals sporting a very similar deck, except with [Bearscape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bearscape) rather than [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest).

### Game One

Jakub won the dice roll and got a very nice start, [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) put a Rootwalla into play and then he dropped second turn [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). Craig had to break it of course, and he did so with a second turn [Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin). Jakub followed up with a [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) and a [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) on only his third turn.

Craig played a third turn [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids) partly to help slow the beatings. Jakub just attacked with everything and when his Mongoose was blocked he used a [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) to gain threshold, keeping his Mongoose alive now that it had threshold. Craig went down to eleven from this attack.

The Englishman played a second [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids); but he couldn’t deal with the thresholded creatures who killed him in two turns.

### Game Two

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/883.jpg)Once again Jakub had a first turn [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) via a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), the Englishman made a [Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) rather than a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) with a view to playing an early [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids). The only argument against this was that Craig had better to hope Jakub didn’t have a [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest).

Slemr made a second turn [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) and the [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids) came into play. He [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)ed the [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) while making a second [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear). Craig could only replay his [Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) and when the [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear)s attacked he didn’t block with [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids), fearing a [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note). That’s what happened anyway and the attack knocked Stevenson down to eleven.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/882.jpg)On his turn he played a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) taking [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), and cast a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade), but he overlooked the fact that Jakub had a [Centaur Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Garden) in play, and didn’t block, taking lethal damage. It didn’t really matter as there was no way he could have stayed alive for more than a couple of turns – he only had three Swamps in play so if his next card had been [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) it still wouldn’t have killed the [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear)s.
