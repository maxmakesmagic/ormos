The Latest *MTG Arena* State of the Game
========================================


Jay Parker gives us a look into *MTG Arena* and a look ahead in [the latest State of the Game](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-jumpstart-historic-horizons-2021-07-29). In this edition, he covers:


* More about the upcoming *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons*, including new digital-only mechanics
* The backend update coming on August 10 and how that will affect the August Ranked Season
* The addition of a 100-card Historic Brawl queue!

There's lots to come in *MTG Arena*!


*Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* Arrives August 12!
=================================================


There's a lot of buzz around the new *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* product coming to *MTG Arena*. We've been previewing over the past week and a half [the packet lists and how they work](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/jumpstart-historic-horizons-packet-lists-2021-07-26) in this digital release.


And in case you missed it, Vice President of Design Aaron Forsythe and *MTG Arena* Game Director Jay Parker [talk in more detail about *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* in this IGN interview](https://www.ign.com/articles/jumpstart-historic-horizons-spoilers-mtg-arena-digital-only-card-reveal-details).


Backend Change and Downtime August 10
=====================================


We'll be making a backend change requiring a few hours of downtime on August 10. This downtime will follow this schedule (all times are approximate):


* 5:30 a.m. PT — No more games can begin
* 6:30 a.m. PT — Real money purchases disabled in the store
* 7:00 a.m. PT — Players will be removed from the system and cannot log in
* Around 11:00 a.m. PT — System back online, players can log in again

This will affect the August 2021 Ranked Season, splitting it into two for this month, one before the update and a second after. Both seasons will grant rewards (rewards for the early one will be available following the downtime).


The early season will quantify the top 500 Mythic Tier players for a Qualifier Weekend; the late season will quantify the usual top 1,200. After the early season, players in tiers up to Diamond won't reset but will remain at the same rank and tier (though may lose pips at that tier). Mythic players will reset to Diamond Tier 1.


Following the downtime, players will receive ten new multicolored decks legal in Standard 2022, which includes any cards not in their collection needed to complete and play those decks!

Welcome to the Yawning Portal
=============================


Visit the Yawning Portal tavern from July 30 through August 10 and explore the dungeon of Undermountain to earn rulebook card styles from *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*!


[This Standard Singleton event](https://magic.wizards.com/mtga-afr-yawning-portal) features the On a Quest! emblem with the text: "Whenever you cast your second spell each turn, venture into the dungeon." You can enter this event as many times as you like, with each run awarding new styles until you've earned them all!


Note: We are aware of a bug that sometimes causes players to receive fewer styles than they should. This bug will be fixed with a deployment on Thursday, August 5 (no client update needed). If you've already been impacted by the bug, please [contact Customer Service](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us) for assistance.


Now in Midweek *Magic*: Singleton!
==================================


Midweek *Magic*'s format this week is Singleton. Singleton uses 60-card decks built from your collection, but with a catch: you may include no more than one copy of any card in your deck (excluding basic lands).


[Midweek *Magic* events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-02#midweekmagic) run weekly from Tuesday at 8 a.m. PT through Thursday at 8 a.m. PT with a different format each week. There is no entry fee, and you can earn two rare individual card rewards—just like FNM at Home.
