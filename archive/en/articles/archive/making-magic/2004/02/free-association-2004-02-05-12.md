Here's a **Magic**-themed game you can play while you and your [**Magic** friends](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-magic) are riding in a car or out to dinner (To quote Richard Garfield: "It'll only take fifteen minutes”). At the beginning of the game choose two to four of the following:


* mana cost
* color
* word in card name
* card type
* expansion
* word in rules text
* artist
* power/toughness

Once you've chosen your parameters, the first person names any **Magic** card in history. The next person has to name a card that matches at least one of the parameters chosen. This continues around the group until a player cannot name a card. No card can be repeated for the length of the entire game (as opposed to just one round). A player unable to name a card loses the round and gets a letter. Once a player spells M-A-G-I-C, he or she is out of the game. A player can claim there are no legal cards to name. The next player can challenge by naming a legal card thus forcing the first player to get a letter. If no challenge occurs, the next player just names a new **Magic** card.


Some of you might be confused, so let me walk you through a round. There are three players, Larry, Curly and Moe. The three, let's call them stooges, have chose mana cost and power/toughness and have chosen to restrict the game to creatures.


**Larry**: [Morphling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling)
