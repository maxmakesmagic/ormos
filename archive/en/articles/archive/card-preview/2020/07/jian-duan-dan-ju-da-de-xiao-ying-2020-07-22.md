Three Small Words, One Great Effect

"Destroy all creatures."


As a control player, I love seeing those words printed on a *Magic: The Gathering* card. Mass creature removal has been a staple of the game since its earliest days and plays a major role in every way to play the game that exists. They're a powerhouse in Limited, a vital tool for competitive Constructed formats, and a way to hit the reset button in Commander. Having access to mass creature removal on your own terms is a huge advantage, and the effect is an auto-include in any control deck worth its salt (in your opponent's tears).


Even when I'm on the receiving end of a board clear, I have to admire the simplicity of the design and the sense of balance that it offers *Magic* as a whole. "Destroy all creatures" is a phrase that's opened up strategic avenues that have been an inherent part of *Magic* from its inception and give creature enthusiasts a reason to get very, very nervous.


In recent years, this effect usually has conditions attached. Cards like [Shatter the Sky](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter+the+Sky), which made a showing in *Magic* World Championship XVI, gave players like eventual champion Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa access to the effect for a mere 2WW (a bargain compared to the five mana of cards like [Time Wipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Wipe) and the Cast Off half of [Realm-Cloaked Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Realm-Cloaked+Giant)) but potentially allowed opponents to draw a card as a result. [Kaya's Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaya%27s+Wrath) from *Ravnica Allegiance* is another example of a board clear that made a splash at the time, again with a converted mana cost of 4 mana.


It's understandable that the mass creature removal seeing the most play is traditionally at four mana. After all, it's the sweet spot for a very good reason. *Magic*'s first set ever established a pretty strong precedent that other cards can only hope to live up to.


That brings us to this special addition to *Double Masters*. It's the progenitor of mass creature removal and the reason why this effect is known in *Magic* simply as a "wrath."


![Wrath of God](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_THysbE4S9M.png)


[Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) originally debuted in *Limited Edition Alpha* and has appeared numerous times throughout *Magic*'s history. It's so iconic that "wrath"—technically a noun—has gone beyond *Magic* to become a tabletop game shorthand verb for getting rid of everything in play. A part of *Magic* history, [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) was included in every core set through *Tenth Edition*. And the original mass-removal spell is back with its now-iconic art from Kev Walker, which first appeared in *Seventh Edition*.


From my experience casting this spell in Limited (mostly Cube—my apologies for the many times I ruined my opponent's plans in Cube by resolving exactly this card), this is a card you're going to want to take highly in *Double Masters* Limited. It's a powerhouse in every Limited format it's graced, so if your opponent is in white, be careful not to overextend your board.


But this is *Double Masters*! It's twice the fun, twice the previews—and in this case—twice the same card!.


![Wrath of God Promo](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_dbcH0qFNFZ.png)


That's right, a Launch promo version of [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) with all-new art by Thomas M. Baxa. This promo will not be available in packs. You'll be able to pick one up by either buying a box of *Double Masters* or by playing in a Launch event (all while supplies last—note that some stores may not be able to have Launch events due to COVID-related regulations and safety, so check with your local store for more details).


In closing, my feelings on Wraths can be summarized by this completely real quote.


*"It is a truth universally acknowledged that an opponent in a game of* Magic: The Gathering *in possession of a good fortune of creatures, must be in want of a Wrath." – Jane Austen, probably*
