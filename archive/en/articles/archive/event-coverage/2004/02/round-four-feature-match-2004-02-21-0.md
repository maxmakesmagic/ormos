They've enjoyed their rest and now they have to shuffle up their decks. Rosa earned his spot by ranking or Pro Tour points while Horno earned his by trial. ### Game 1

Horno was the first to blink with [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter) but De Rosa quickly put it away with [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror). Marcos tried [Arcbound Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Hybrid+) and Antonino slowed him down with Chiterring Rats.

Antonino (looking at the spectators): "You are a hometown favorite. The crowd wants you to win." 

The Hybrid grabbed a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) and the American took the time to elaborate on how good the card is before nullifying the attack with [Icy Manipulator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator). Still unimpressed the Spanish played [Fangren Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter). Once again the controlling Antonino stopped him dead on its tracks - this time with [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest).

Finally, Marcos passed the turn without a play. The Rats waltzed into the Red Zone and a [Goblin War Wagon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon) joined the American's side of the table.

The Spanish redid his battle plan and unleashed [Solar Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Tide) with Entwine. His [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) gave him some extra options while De Rosa bounced right back with [Culling Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Scales) and [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem). The Icy denied Horno his second Green mana but he had Raise The Alarm to draw some extra cards.

Antonino: "You are drawing a lot of cards, my friend."

Still Marcos Horno had nothing to stop the Scales from eating up his [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). The amazing artifact was gone but had six extra cards from it. He played [Loxodon Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) to keep things under control but De Rosa's Icy was on fire.

The [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) attacked and [Leonin Abunas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) came into play to protect the team.

Antonino: "For the people out there... my deck is looking really good but it's actually really bad. I'm drawing all my good cards."

On the next swing Horno dropped a surprise [Tangle Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Spider) but the Icy kept it out of the blocking game. With no blockers available Antonino De Rosa played Stir The Pride to finish the first game.

Antonino 1 - Marcos 0.

### Game 2

The American had to send his first hand back but seemed happy with his second one. Horno came out first with turn-two [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) and turn-three [Whispersilk Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak). Across the table a [Yotian Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) showed up, quickly followed by [Scavenging Scarab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Scarab). Marcos played [Raise the Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and used [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold) to blow up De Rosa's lone [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains).

Antonino: "Gutsy."

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/r4fm2_2.jpg)He played a second Scarab saying he was trying to fish out the Wrath ([Solar Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Tide)) He thought Horno had in his hand. On and on the equipped Myr attacked, while [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) shut down one of the Scarabs. Finally Antonino found another [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and played [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith) fetching [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar).

The Spanish was falling behind visibly, and a turn later he showed a hand full of lands and [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). Although [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) is good, it can't do much if you don't have enough life to work with.

Final result: Antonino 2 - Marcos 0.
