It's all stone gargoyles; vaulted cathedral ceilings; and gold filigree-covered, high-backed chairs at Wizards HQ. We ask ourselves, "What's the best way to ~~exploit the Community Team's weaknesses, ensuring our victory~~ get to know the Community Team?" Of course! We can ~~gather intel~~ learn about their interests and *Magic* history with a detailed questionnaire! Heck! The Wizards Team will write up profiles too, as a show of good faith. We have nothing to hide from these community upstarts! With a plan in action, we steeple our fingers and have deep, philosophical talks about the color pie. Watching. Waiting for the 2014 Community Cup.


Keep your eye on the site the next four Wednesdays: August 20, August 27, September 3, and September 10. We'll be featuring player profiles for every player on both team rosters! Once profiles post, links will be added in the [profile directory](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/2014-community-cup-player-profiles-2014-08-18).


The last set of profiles comes out two days before the 2014 Community Cup begins on September 12! The gauntlet of 2014 Community Cup events will run from that Friday until Sunday, September 14. We'll have video coverage of all of the events running on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) too, so remember to tune in!


Here are the player profiles we're covering today!

* [Dave Humpherys](#davehumpherys)
* [Tom LaPille](#tomlapille)



Helene Bergeot
**What is your position at Wizards?**


I'm the director of global organized play; my team is in charge of creating fun gaming experiences for *Magic* players, from Friday Night *Magic* to the Pro Tour, and including conventions.


**When did you start playing *Magic?***


I played *Magic* for the very first time in 1994. Wizards of the Coast was presenting *Magic* to the gaming company I was working for at the time; I therefore happened to learn how to play with the early crew of Wizards of the Coast.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


Muay Thai kickboxing. I started shortly after moving to the US as there's a class for Wizards employees. I really got hooked; it's an excellent workout, it's fun and I feel I can always get better!


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**


Any card that gives me the opportunity to quickly kill my opponent gets all my love.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


Red and green. I'm totally Gruul!


**What will the Community Team love the most about Wizards HQ?**


It's a difficult question as there are so many possible options: the lovely Seattle weather, observing how quickly the free tables are emptied, the free popcorn in the kitchen, taking a selfie with Mitzy?


Actually, there are many people who are passionate about *Magic* in the building and it's always a great experience for visitors; I hope it'll be the same for the Community Team.


**What are you doing to prepare for the Community Cup?**


Getting a coach. Seriously.


**What is your favorite movie and TV show?**


I'm not watching much TV; catching up on *The Walking Dead* and *Game of Thrones* at the moment.


**Who would you want to play you in a movie about your life?**


Benedict Cumberbatch, but I guess it would not be extremely credible.


**What is your favorite food?**


I have a serious weakness for seafood, with crab and sea urchin at the top of my list. Cheese is pretty close.


**If you had a theme song play every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


"Jerk It Out" by Caesars.


**Which plane would you want to visit on vacation?**


Theros! (I'm a big fan of Greek mythology, took ancient Greek for five years, and my first name is Greek.)



Matt Gregory
**What is your position at Wizards?**


*Magic Online* card set developer


**When did you start playing *Magic?***


Early 2001, around the time of the *Planeshift* release.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


Video games, board games, mahjong.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


I love designing and playing Cube. I could go on for a while about why, but the thing I enjoy most is how many different kinds of cards and decks you see. I've seen a lot of justifiable card choices that don't have a good home anywhere else anymore (except maybe Commander, which is another format I enjoy), which leads to unique matchups and interactions.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**


[Cowards can't block Warriors.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382220)


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


None. I enjoy playing against anything as long as I'm playing a deck that makes the matchup interesting.


**How did you feel when you learned you'd been selected to be on the Wizards Team?**


Excited and nervous at the same time. I play plenty of *Magic* with friends, but it has been a while since I've participated in an event. The formats sound like a lot of fun, though!


**What is your favorite food?**


Pie! Dumplings are also delicious.



Dave Humpherys
**What is your position at Wizards?**


I manage the *Magic* developers in R&D. I've had the opportunity to lead a number of sets including *Conspiracy*, *Journey into Nyx*, *Gatecrash*, *Avacyn Restored*, and other upcoming sets.


**When did you start playing *Magic?***


I started playing during spring break from college in 1994 with some friends from high school who had picked up *Unlimited* Starter Decks for each of us to learn.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


Chasing around a 16-month old and playing a variety of strategy games.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


Draft is my favorite format. I enjoy adapting each draft to new cards and combinations of cards. The variety of gameplay and cards that see play in Draft games is also great.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**


[Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic) is my favorite card, since it allowed me to test-drive a bunch of creatures through the days. It's a guilty pleasure.


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


I HATE playing against decks that have a lot of powerful search effects, since games against them tend to be more tedious and scripted than I enjoy.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


I'm very blue-aligned. Beyond that I'd say that I'm most to least represented by: green, white, black, then red.


**How did you feel when you learned you'd been selected to be on the Wizards Team?**


I was excited to be included on the Wizards Team because I especially enjoy the wacky formats and the competition. This event reminds me of the couple of *Magic Invitational* events I was lucky enough to have participated in and that I thought were great fun.


**What will the Community Team love the most about Wizards HQ?**


Our Dragon.


**What are you doing to prepare for the Community Cup?**


With luck, catching up on sleep.


**What is your favorite movie and TV show?**


I'm apparently a sucker for movies about memory since *Memento* and *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* are atop the list of my favorite movies. My favorite TV show is *Seinfeld* and among current shows it's *Game of Thrones*.


**Who would you want to play you in a movie about your life?**


John Malkovich.


**What is your favorite food?**


Fish, especially sushi.


**Which plane would you want to visit on vacation?**


Theros. I'm guessing it would have the best beaches.



Tom LaPille
**What is your position at Wizards?**


Designer advanced, *Magic Online*, R&D


**When did you start playing *Magic?***


*Tempest*


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


I teach kenjutsu and play roleplaying games.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


Modern, because it has interactive enough games but also enough crazy things going on.


**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?**


[Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), because I love red cards that still give me decisions.


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


Dredge.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


Green.


**How did you feel when you learned you'd been selected to be on the Wizards Team?**


With my hands.


**What will the Community Team love the most about Wizards HQ?**


Access to cool people like me!


**What are you doing to prepare for the Community Cup?**


Running up and down stairs in stadiums.


**What is your favorite movie and TV show?**


*Exit Through the Gift Shop*, *Lost*.

Vin Diesel.

Massaman Curry.

"Planetarium" by Squarepusher.

Ravnica. I'm a city kid!
