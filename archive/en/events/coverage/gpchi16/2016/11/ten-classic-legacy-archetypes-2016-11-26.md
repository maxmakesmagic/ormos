For those of you unfamiliar with Legacy or don't dabble with it all that much, that's what I'm here for. In a matter of minutes, you'll be able to get a quick overview to this high-exciting format and what to expect this weekend at Grand Prix Chiba.


Legacy is non-rotating format which means that every single card—with the exception of a small [ban list](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/banned-restricted) —can be used. This makes Legacy a diverse format with extremely high power level because you're using the best cards from throughout Magic's illustrated history. While there are dozens of different archetypes, some strategies are more popular than others!


Here is a quick summary of ten classic Legacy archetypes which you'll likely encounter this weekend! Ready?


**1. Miracles**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Counterbalance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Terminus)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus)
Miracles is a White-Blue control deck that often splashes red for some sideboard cards. The deck is so named because it uses [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) and [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) together with [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) to help cast them at a discount. Since [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) is in the mix, it makes perfect sense to also play with [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and pilots of this deck will often be able to lock out their opponent by manipulating the top of their library.


[Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) provides protection against unfair combo decks, while [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) is one of the best removal spells to ever have been printed in the game. The red splash is usually for [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast), [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), [Izzet Staticaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Staticaster) or some burn-based removal spells.


**2. Grixis Delver**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Delver+of+Secrets)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Insectile+Aberration)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration)Transform [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Young+Pyromancer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gurmag+Angler)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler)
There are many shades of Delver decks but Grixis remains the most popular variant and probably the one that puts up the most consistent results. It essentially works like the Modern version, except that the countermagic suite has been replaced with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) and [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle).


Aside from [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) and [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler), [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) is also excellent in providing a lot of utility. This is a deck that seeks to clock opponents quickly while backed up with removal spells, burn spells and counterspells.


**3. Eldrazi**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eye+of+Ugin)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thought-Knot+Seer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chalice+of+the+Void)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void)
When Oath of the Gatewatch unleashed a horde of Eldrazis, it wrecked havoc in Modern because of the ability to summon them cheaply with [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple) and [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin). The latter received the banhammer in Modern, putting a stop to its dominance.


However, the archetype is alive and well in Legacy!


Aside from the ability to play both above-mentioned lands, Legacy Eldrazi enthusiasts also gain access to [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)! The deck is capable of very unfair openings involving free [Endless One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+One)s and [Eldrazi Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Mimic)s which is often accompanied by game-winning and soul-crushing [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer)s and [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)s. Most importantly, the ability to power out early [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) is another aspect that makes the Eldrazi deck so terrifying.


**4. Sneak and Show / Omnitell**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sneak+Attack)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Show+and+Tell)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Omniscience)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience)
If you like to play with unfair combo cards like [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) and [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell), then either of these decks would appeal to you! Using these two cards, the aim is to “cheat” out either [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand), [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) or [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience). The combo deck sculpts its hand with the usual [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), protects it with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), while accelerating into (and playing around [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze)) with [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal).


Ever since [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) got banned, [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) archetypes have taken a hit and it is also likely that [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) might just fall out of popularity all together.


**5. Elves**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gaea%27s+Cradle)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Cradle) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Heritage+Druid)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nettle+Sentinel)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel)
Also commonly referred to as “Elfball” or “Combo Elves”, the deck draws strength from [Gaea's Cradle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Cradle), [Glimpse of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature) and [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith), which in combination creates an extremely powerful engine that can win you the game as early as turn two. If you have [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid), two [Nettle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel)s and [Glimpse of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature) already resolved, you'll effectively be gaining mana for every one mana Elf you cast and you will soon be able to draw a lot of cards.


To win the game, you also have access to [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) which helps you to find [Craterhoof Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth) or [Shaman of the Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+the+Pack) for the lethal blow!


**6. Blue-Black / Black-Red Reanimator**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Entomb)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reanimate)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Animate+Dead)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead)
Reanimator strategies have traditionally revolved around [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) and [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) and you can easily get the creature you want into the graveyard with the help of [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb). Blue variants play [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) but red variants have [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting), which is a significant upgrade. At the cost of forgoing [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze), Black-Red Reanimator player get their disruption in the form of [Chancellor of the Annex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Annex) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize).


The Blue-Black version is a classic, while the Black-Red version is one of the newer kids on the block and with it being popular on Magic Online recently, you should expect to see it running around Chiba as well.


**7. Storm**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tendrils+of+Agony)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Past+in+Flames)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gitaxian+Probe)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)
The winner of [Grand Prix Prague 2016](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppra16) took down the whole event with this combo deck that wins by casting at least nine spells in a single turn before firing off a lethal [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony). It doesn't look as hard as it seems, because some of the spells are either free to cast, or they generate you mana to help you cast more spells.


[Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond), [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) and [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) contribute to the “storm count”, while providing mana to keep the engine running with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Once they find [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames), they'll be able to discard their entire hand, cast their entire graveyard, and also have hellbent for [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) to search up their namesake sorcery!


**8. Lands**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Life+from+the+Loam)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exploration)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wasteland)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)
As the name suggests, this deck is a rather special one in a sense that it runs more lands than usual. *Way* more lands than usual, if I may add. [Exploration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration) and [Manabond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabond) helps them get around the rule that you can only play one land a turn and they have a lot of utility despite not having very many spells. Yes, you have [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) and [Crop Rotation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crop+Rotation), but those cards only act to help you get to the land you want.


What are some of these special lands, you might ask?


Well, for starters you can always ruin your opponent's day by destroying all their lands with [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) and [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) before locking down creature strategies with [The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Tabernacle+at+Pendrell+Vale) or [Glacial Chasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Chasm). And then you can use [Thespian's Stage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage) to copy [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) in order to get a 20/20 indestructible creature. [Maze of Ith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith) is “removal” that takes shape in the form of a land. If need be, you also have the combo of [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire)s and [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows). Lands is a unique hybrid of a control deck with a combo element that places heavy emphasis on the recursion.


**9. Shardless Sultai**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ancestral+Vision)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shardless+Agent)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shardless+Agent) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tarmogoyf)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)
Shardless Sultai is a midrange deck that seeks to out-grind the opponent and it is built around extracting value. The deck is able to trade resources pretty well because it has a lot of tools to get back an edge. For example, [Shardless Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shardless+Agent) is almost always a two-for-one and if you manage to cascade into [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) that's pretty much the jackpot.


Other tools available to the Shardless Sultai player are [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), Llliana of the Veil, [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay), [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) and [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor).


**10. Death and Taxes**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%C3%86ther+Vial)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flickerwisp)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben)
The etymology of the deck's name is not clear but this is what the Legacy community knows to be the premier White Weenie aggro deck of the format. Using [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial), it is able to quickly assemble an army of very efficient yet disruptive creatures such as [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes), [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker) and [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben). There's also the availability of [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) and the ability to reuse effects and protect creatures from spot removal with [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp).


Death and Taxes also receives a huge upgrade with the addition of Thalia, Heretic of Cathar, [Sanctum Prelate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Prelate), [Recruiter of the Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recruiter+of+the+Guard) and even [Palace Jailer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Jailer). More on that later!


Of course, there are numerous other decks out there such as Maverick, [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren), [Food Chain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Food+Chain), Merfolk, Burn, Jund, Dredge and more. Oh yes, Infect also won [Grand Prix Columbus 2016](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcol16) so let's not forget about it just yet! Now that you have a brief overview of Legacy, let's watch things unfold together!
