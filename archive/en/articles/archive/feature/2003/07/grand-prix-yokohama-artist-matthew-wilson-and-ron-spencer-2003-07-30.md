Ron Spencer has worked many jobs over the years. He's pulled shoulder blades out of sides of beef all day, done construction, printed T-shirts, and even worked in a bleach factory. Spencer achieves a distinctive look through an eclectic use of mixed media. He uses everything from colored pencils to ball-point pens, and watercolors to acrylic paint. He has a tendency to feature characters that seem to be missing, for lack of a better word, skin. "That's just my inexperienced knowledge of anatomy rearing its head. I know it's not necessarily how a formally trained artist would do it." Spencer did get a little training at a two-year college in Idaho, although he says what he really learned in school was that in order to succeed, an artist needs to "shut off the TV and stay up until 3 a.m." His inspirations include the vividly photographic style of Richard Corben (a popular sci-fi and fantasy illustrator who often works with Dark Horse Comics) and Swamp Thing illustrator Bernie Wrightson. He also has illustrated for other games, including Legend of the Five Rings, Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, and the werewolf game Rage. He still lives in Aurora, Nebraska, where he was born, with his wife and five children.
