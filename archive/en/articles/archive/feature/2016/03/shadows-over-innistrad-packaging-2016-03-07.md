In a set full of mysteries, I have no doubt many players and Innistrad experts will be poring over these images looking for clues to the set's contents, to Innistrad's future, and to the mysteries the set portends.


Also, they're pretty.


Let's start with the first packaging you're likely to hold: the Prerelease kit (Prereleases are April 2â€”contact your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) now for registration, these can fill up fast!).


There are two parts to the kit, one of which is the exterior sleeve, featuring a face you should get pretty familiar with for this article: Jace, shadowy figure.

But when you pull the sleeve off, you'll be greeted by this cool packaging to hold your cards.

And if you do well at the Prerelease, you could win some packs! And those packs look a little like these. First up, a Vampire of some ill repute, no doubt.

Next, what I'm sure is a run-of-the-mill Werewolf. Probably nothing special about it that would place it on the packaging.

Next up is the mad Avacyn, the Purifier, the flipped side of Archangel Avacyn.

And it wouldn't be an Innistrad set if we didn't get a glimpse of Sorin. But what kind of glimpse will we receive? And when?

This is Jace. You've met.

*Shadows over Innistrad* will also come in Fat Pack form, and it'll look a little something like this:

Which looks quite a bit like the Deck Builder's Toolkit:

And, in case you haven't seen enough spooky Jace with a popped collar, well...

All of these will be available April 8 when *Shadows over Innistrad* goes on sale.
