**Nam Sung Wook (Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* Finalist):** I am playing Jund and I love [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction). I was able to surprise a few combo players by removing their key card.

**Don van Ravenzwaaij (Australia Pro Point Leader):** [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls). It was good against the sea of blue decks this weekend!

**Shota Yasooka (Pro Tour Charleston Champion):** Jund. [Night of Souls' Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+of+Souls%27+Betrayal) is my best sideboard card.

**Lee Shi Tian (4 Pro Tour Top 8s):** [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), of course! It's like my trademark card now. I'm playing Grishoalbrand.

**Leong Ding Yuan (World Championships 2005 Top 8):** I'm playing Boros Burn and the third [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) was awesome. I played against 4 Merfolk already!

**Ken Yukuhiro (Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* Top 8):** [Stain the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stain+the+Mind). I am playing Next Level Abzan and combo decks are bad matchups.
