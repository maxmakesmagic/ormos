PRO TOUR 25TH ANNIVERSARY BASICS
================================


Here are the key details to know about Pro Tour 25th Anniversary, and whether you're a Pro Tour coverage veteran or a newcomer to competitive *Magic*, you should review all the details because this tournament differs significantly from the events you may be accustomed to!


* The Pro Tour is a three-day invitation-only event featuring some of greatest *Magic* pros as well as top-finishing Grand Prix competitors, Hall of Famers, and players who found success in Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers that took place a few weeks ago.
* Pro Tour 25th Anniversary is a *team* event—the Pro Tour's first since Charleston in 2006! Those players will be competing for a share of an **$850,000** prize pool, with $150,000 going to the winning team along with invitations to the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.
* Pro Tour 25th Anniversary is the last Pro Tour of the 2017–18 season, and the last event for this season's Pro Tour Team Series, meaning we will know our final two teams that will be competing at the 2018 World Championship on Sunday, September 23. For a look at where the teams stand headed into this event, check out the [2017–18 Team Series leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/protour/teamseries/2017-18-leaderboard).
* The format for all three days of this Pro Tour is Team Trios Constructed. In this format, teams of three bring one Standard, one Modern, and one Legacy deck. One player on each team is assigned to play each format for the entirety of the tournament.
* Unlike most Pro Tours, Pro Tour 25th Anniversary has no cut for Day Two and has seven rounds of Swiss on Friday and Saturday rather than eight, meaning a team can compete in all fourteen rounds of Swiss on both days of Swiss before the cut.
* The Top 4 teams at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a traditional single-elimination bracket.
* All matches played on Sunday are best three out of five in individual matches, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action. The team that secures two individual match wins will advance to the next round.

Also happening during Pro Tour 25th Anniversary's big weekend is the Silver Showcase, a $150,000 Year-1 *Magic* Rochester Draft event featuring eight famous faces from *Magic* and gaming in general. What's Year 1 Rochester Draft? It's a unique Draft format featuring *Limited Edition (Beta)*, *Arabian Nights*, *Antiquities*, and *Legends*, and Thursday, August 1 will be the day these packs get opened and competitors build decks using cards from *Magic*'s very first year of existence.


Pro Tour 25th Anniversary is definitely not your average Pro Tour; it's the first team Pro Tour in over a decade, and there's significantly more money on the line than usual. I recommend checking out [Rich Hagon's Pro Tour preview](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-25th-anniversary-preview-2018-07-30) for a deeper dive into the whole weekend.


Key Stories for this Pro Tour
=============================


Outside of crowning Pro Tour Champions—three to be exact—a few big stories will emerge from this event.


* The 2018 World Championship field of 24 players will be decided by the end of this Pro Tour. Tune in to see who will qualify to compete for their share of $300,000 in Las Vegas, Nevada, September 21–23!
* The 2017–18 Pro Tour Team Series will have its top two teams locked, and they'll be going to the 2018 World Championship to compete in a Team Sealed finals that features *Guilds of Ravnica* before its official release on Sunday, September 23.
