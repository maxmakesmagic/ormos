New features include sneak previews of six *Innistrad* cards and the ability for players to take on the role of the Archenemy. There will be eleven new single-player campaign levels where you must defeat three Planeswalkers as the Archenemy, and you can create multiplayer games and choose to play either as the Archenemy or as a Planeswalker battling to take down the Archenemy. Players will also be introduced to Ral Zarek, a new Planeswalker exclusive to **Duels** 2012.

Here are the highlights of the **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012 Expansion:

* Three new playable decks: Liliana Vess's "Grave Whispers" deck, Ajani Goldmane's "Auramancer" deck, and Ral Zarek's "Cloudburst" deck
* Six exclusive sneak-preview cards from the upcoming *Innistrad*  expansion
* Players can become the Archenemy in single-player and online multiplayer formats
* Six new single-player campaign levels and eleven Archenemy single-player campaign levels
* Four Archenemy challenges
* Four additional card unlocks for all thirteen **Duels**  2012 decks
* New achievements on Xbox, Steam, and PlayStation
* New loading screens featuring art and text exclusive to the **Duels**  2012 Expansion

Can't wait until early fall? Come by the **Magic**  booth at PAX on August 25-28 to play the expansion before it goes on sale!
