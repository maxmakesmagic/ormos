### Commentary:


I made two daring moves with my Malgareth designs- asking Scott if I could reverse his counter theme and asking Mark if I could embrace Malgareth's factionalism by using two 3-card cycles (divided along Native and Watcher colors) in place of one the 5-card cycles.


Scott's initial counter theme played up stealing, but, with that gone, I wanted to explore Ken's suggestion that removing -1/-1 counters would be more fun than constantly removing bonuses. It also felt appropriate to the story that the prisoners were now breaking free and turning on the Watchers. This image lead to common instants that retooled Scott's countercast spells, requiring a payment of something that is normally a penalty. On a larger scale, this lead to exploring legends who broke free from their bonds.


The legends were met with resistance on the wiki by some who felt the counters read like too much downside, but I feel players start by reading a card's name and looking at its artwork, which have potential to be amazing. They then glance at mana cost and power/toughness. Here, that ratio should drop jaws. Players will start on the text, find the expected downside, but keep reading to realize undoing that downside is further upside.


The uncommon composters were inspired by Insatiable Rot, Snarling Iguanar, and the desire to reward Scott's sacrifice theme. The rare Watcher spells attempted to play into the Watchers' strategy of using an enemy's resources against them, but without making them unplayable against the wrong opponent.
