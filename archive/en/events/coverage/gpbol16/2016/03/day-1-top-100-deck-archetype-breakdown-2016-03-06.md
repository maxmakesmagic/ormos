Almost 700 players made it into the second day of competition here in Bologna, but to give you a timely metagame breakdown of the very top of the standings after Day 1, we focused on the deck choices of the players in the Top 100 of the standings after Round 9. Most of them had 22 or more points (i.e., a 7-1-1 record) but the Top 100 also included several players with 21 points (i.e., a 7-2 record) and good tiebreakers.


Let's get to the numbers!




| Archetype | Number of players |
| --- | --- |
| W/U Eldrazi | 26 |
| R/G Eldrazi | 11 |
| Abzan Company | 10 |
| Affinity | 9 |
| W/U Control | 9 |
| Living End | 7 |
| Bring to Light Scapeshift | 4 |
| Abzan Chord | 3 |
| Elves | 2 |
| Lantern Control | 2 |
| Merfolk | 2 |
| Naya Burn | 2 |
| Urzatron | 2 |
| 8-Rack | 1 |
| Abzan Midrange | 1 |
| Ascendancy Ascension | 1 |
| Bant Company | 1 |
| G/U Eldrazi | 1 |
| G/W Eldrazi | 1 |
| Goryo's Vengeance | 1 |
| G/U Infect | 1 |

A few clarifying notes on deck names and deck composition are in order:


* White-blue Eldrazi is the most popular archetype because it's well-suited for defeating other Eldrazi decks and because it has access to strong colored sideboard options. Several white-blue Eldrazi decks had a minor green splash for a few copies of [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) in addition their [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) and [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope).
* The red-green Eldrazi decks were split between aggro variants with [Eldrazi Obligator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Obligator) and [Eldrazi Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Mimic) and control variants with [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return) and [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker). All of them use [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings) to find [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) and [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple) even more consistently.
* Abzan Company and Abzan Chord are similar decks, as both try to assemble a creature-based infinite-life combo. The key difference is that Abzan Company plans to gather [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast), and [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), whereas Abzan Chord aims to find [Spike Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder) and [Archangel of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune).
* One Abzan Company deck, as well as the Bant Company deck, splashed blue for [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage). It looks like the 2/3 is extending its impact beyond Standard. In the current Modern format, bouncing [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer) can be a sweet tempo play that nets a free card.
* The two Urzatron decks were split between colors: one was classically red-green; the other was white-green. In a world plagued by humongous Eldrazi, [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) can be better than [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm).

Before we go, there is one final question to answer: How popular was Eldrazi as a whole?


Well, if we add up all the different Eldrazi variants, then the Top-100 decks after Day 1 were comprised of 39% Eldrazi and 61% non-Eldrazi. It cannot be deniedâ€”at least at the start of Day 2, the Eldrazi are dominating.


We'll see at the end of the day whether this trend continues or if the "resistance," heralded mainly by a group of players relying on [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) or [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) to sweep the monstrous Eldrazi, can claw back and exterminate the tentacled menace.
