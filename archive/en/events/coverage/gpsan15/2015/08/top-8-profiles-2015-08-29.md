**Age, Hometown, Occupation**: 29 / Santiago


**Previous Accomplishments:** : Top 10 Worlds 2013


**Where do you normally play *Magic*?**: In “La Forja De Stone” and Magic Online.


**What was the best card in any of your decks this weekend, and why?**: [Somberwald Alpha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somberwald+Alpha). I played him in Swiss Rounds and in the first draft of Day 2. It won me a lot of rounds.


**What's your favorite *Magic* card in *Origins*?**: [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade). I didn't play it in Swiss or either draft, but it's a common that attacks and defends very well.


**What was the most interesting play you made so far this weekend?**: Not playing a land so that my opponent thought I was mana-screwed. This let me [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) for more creatures. I lost seven life by that play, but it was worth it.
