Pauper Banned List Update
-------------------------


As announced in [yesterday's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/september-19-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement), four cards have been added to the Banned List in Pauper:


* [Aarakocra Sneak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aarakocra+Sneak)
* [Stirring Bard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Bard)
* [Underdark Explorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underdark+Explorer)
* [Vicious Battlerager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Battlerager)

These changes took effect in *Magic Online* yesterday, and all players with those cards in their deck at the time of the banning have had that League course ended with the entry option returned.

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend.


These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and invitations to the 2023 World Championship!


This week on Saturday, September 24, we have the Standard Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC), and on Sunday, September 25, we have the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC).


Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in December.
