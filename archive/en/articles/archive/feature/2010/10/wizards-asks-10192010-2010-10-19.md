*Do you prefer two-player or multiplayer **Magic** games?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennethnagle.jpg)**Kenneth Nagle:** I definitely prefer multiplayer. There are many ways to enjoy **Magic**—perhaps it's trading cards, winning tournaments, or even exploring the game design behind the product itself. To me, the most enjoyable parts are deck building and social interaction. Multiplayer indeed multiplies the social aspect of **Magic**, including adding a layer of politics to the game.

After all, I find playing **Magic** its own reward.
