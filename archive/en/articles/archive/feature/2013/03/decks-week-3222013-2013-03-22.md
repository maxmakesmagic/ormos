Nathan Holiday showed us that, as when making omelets, to win a Modern tournament you've got to break a few Eggs. Meanwhile, in Europe, a trio of Swedes rose to the top of a Team Limited tournament by… beating another team of Swedes. Congratulations go to Nathan for his victory at [Grand Prix San Diego](/en/events/coverage/holiday-serves-eggs-gp-san-diego) and to Jonathan Bergström, Tomas Westling, and Fredrik Carlsson for defeating their countrymen to win [Grand Prix Utrecht](/en/events/coverage/swedes-sweep-grand-prix-utrecht). Going back to Modern, that's the format for this season's PTQs to get you into Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*!
