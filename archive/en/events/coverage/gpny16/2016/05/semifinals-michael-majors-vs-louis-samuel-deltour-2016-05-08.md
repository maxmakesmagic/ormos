Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Michael Majors won Grand Prix San Diego and he's looking to win another here at Grand Prix New York. Majors' Green-White Tokens deck with maindeck [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance) has been dominating the competition all weekend.


Louis-Samuel Deltour isn't ready to let Majors take this one down, though. This Grand Prix ringer came all the way from Paris, France to loop [Brood Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Monitor) with [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer). It's been working pretty well thus far. Deltour called his mother back in France when he first made Top 8 and he's hoping to make Mom proud by bringing a trophy back to the homeland!


Michael Majors asked, “What seed were you coming into the Top 8?”


Louis Deltour was too busy jamming out to music on his headphones while he shuffled up, though.


“Louis,” Majors tapped the table in front of Louis, “what seed were you?”


“Eighth,” Deltour nodded his head with a smile to what was obviously an awesome song.


The first game went how games in this matchup often do. Both players quickly established a board presence that made attacking on the ground very difficult.

Majors left four mana untapped, representing [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), and, after some thought, Deltour sent his team in anyway. Majors didn't seem to have [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), but he did have [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance) to clean up the board after Deltour unloaded a bit of his hand.


[Cryptolith Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Rite)s meant that Samuel Deltour would have a lot of mana from this point forward and he continued to play out threats by generating extra cards with [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter) while Majors tried to hide behind [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker).


[Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) didn't look too exciting when Deltour had [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) for the following turn. Majors had a pair of [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate)s the next time around, but Deltour could just continually abuse the interaction between [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) and [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) to clear the way for a now lethal attack.


**Deltour 1 - 0 Majors**


Majors got off to a nice start with [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) and [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) in the second game.


When Deltour tried to double block the [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), it wildly backfired. Majors had [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) for a huge play that grew his [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) while also taking out Deltour's [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter).

[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) is a powerful card, though, and Deltour was able to get right back into the game with a single copy. It wasn't too long before Deltour had assembled the [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) combination and Majors was suddenly having a very difficult time keeping any threat on the board.


Another [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) put Deltour even further ahead and it seemed like Majors would need a lot to go his way if he wanted to win the game.


Majors had [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn), but even the hottest five-drop in Magic wouldn't do very much against [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) and [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer).


The game dragged on, but more [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter) activations let Deltour find threat after threat.


Majors thought long and hard and eventually came out of the tank with a route to victory. [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) was followed up with a [Westvale Abbey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey) activation to flip into Ormendahl. Majors looked like he might have a shot, but Deltour was able to rebuild his board in the blink of an eye.


A couple turns later, [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter) combined with [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) and [Brood Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Monitor) to allow Deltour to find any card he wanted from his deck. He definitely wanted [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) and, by repeatedly sacrificing three Eldrazi Scion to blink [Brood Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Monitor) and make three more Eldrazi Scion, the [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) was able to drain its way to victory.


**Louis Deltour defeats Michael Majors in two games!**
