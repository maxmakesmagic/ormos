Like most *Magic* players, I mark time by *Magic* sets.


I started at Wizards of the Coast with *Journey into Nyx*.


The first time I started going to PTQs was *Champions of Kamigawa*.


My first real heartbreak was during original *Ravnica*.


I met my wife just before *Magic Origins* (fitting).


I married my wife just before *Hour of Devastation* (well that's ominous).


And I started playing during *Ice Age*. But I *really* started playing when *Alliances* came out.


So that's where today's story begins, with a new player, a new set, and an *InQuest*.


The second deck I ever took to a store-level tournament (I use the term "store" loosely—back then we played in a mall food court) was a White-Blue [Browse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Browse)-Post deck that used [Browse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Browse) and [Soldevi Digger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldevi+Digger) to set up a kill (eventually) with [Kjeldoran Outpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Outpost). [Thawing Glaciers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thawing+Glaciers) was there, too.


While that deck set me up to be a lifelong fan of doing nothing for long periods of time, my very first competitive deck and the deck that spawned my love of *Alliances* actually had no blue cards in it. In fact, it was red and green, featuring these two all-stars.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3178)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3178) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2592)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2592)
Yes, my first Standard deck (then called Type II) was land destruction. I found the deck in an issue of *InQuest*—an old gaming magazine that focused on *Magic*—that I can still picture in my head today. It was a five-page spread showing off the four best decks in Type II. The first was the [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) deck of lore, one of the best Standard decks ever. That was followed by Erhnamgeddon, a green-white deck featuring Elves and mana stones and [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon). [Erhnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn) became much better when you didn't even have Forests in play. The fourth deck was Turbo Stasis. We don't like talking about that one.


The third deck listed was Red-Green Land Destruction. And it immediately caught my eye.


Of course, this was a time when it was totally okay to jam four [Strip Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine)s into your deck. Oh, and also the mulligan rule didn't let you mulligan unless you had zero or all lands in your hand. And you had both [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) to cast [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage), [Thermokarst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermokarst), or [Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) on turn two. If you were on the play and had one of these sequences (and it was pretty trivial to do so), your opponent basically didn't get to play *Magic* and you just kind of killed them with whatever you had sitting around. Usually an [Erhnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn) or the card I held most dear to my heart for the longest time, the red [Juzám Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juz%C3%A1m+Djinn).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3161)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3161)
It was glorious.


I think I can even still recreate that old decklist from memory. Let's try it:

Yeah, that's pretty close. I believe [Black Vise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise) was restricted at the time and [Strip Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine) was restricted shortly thereafter, but this pretty closely matches my memory. Which is all that matters in this particular nostalgia trip.


I loved *Alliances* so much that it's the only set earlier than *Journey into Nyx* of which I own a complete set. And I loved [Balduvian Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balduvian+Horde) so much that I kept it in a glass screw case for years. The kind you see people keep [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) in these days. I even still own my original [Balduvian Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balduvian+Horde)s from that deck. They're both in my *Alliances* set. See?


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/CP20180226_Horde.jpg)


Suffice it to say, I loved *Alliances* back then, and I still have a nostalgic soft spot in my heart for the deck now. I try to jam [Browse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Browse), [Kjeldoran Outpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Outpost), [Thawing Glaciers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thawing+Glaciers), [Soldevi Digger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldevi+Digger), [Diminishing Returns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminishing+Returns), [Library of Lat-Nam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Lat-Nam), [Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exile), [Helm of Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience), [Lake of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lake+of+the+Dead), [Lim-Dûl's Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lim-D%C3%BBl%27s+Vault), [Lodestone Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Bauble), [Ritual of the Machine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ritual+of+the+Machine), [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage), and more in decks whenever I can. And that barely scratches the surface of the cards that make me feel all the nostalgia from that set.


And that's the feeling I get from *Masters 25* every time I look over the card list. Chills. Memories of that mall food court. [Balduvian Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balduvian+Horde) hitting the board on turn three against an opponent with one land in play. It's a set just dripping with nostalgia—even if that nostalgia is a bit more, um, common these days.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_U4OceeelSF.png)![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_ZWjfn2HTKK.png)


I'll admit, I felt a bit betrayed that [Balduvian Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balduvian+Horde) is a common these days, but creatures are simply better now. Plus, *Masters* sets have a bit more oomph going for them. A 5/5 for four just isn't the world-ending threat it used to be.


But it's still very, very good, particularly in Limited, where the random discard might be worth it just for a board-dominating threat at only four mana.


[Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage), meanwhile, is simply one of the best land destruction spells ever printed. [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) does more, [Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) is easier to cast, and [Sinkhole](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinkhole) is cheaper, but none of them are nearly as flexible as [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage).


But honestly? I don't even care much about their power level. The feeling that I'll get when opening them up in boosters will be plenty for me. Fourteen-year-old me will be grinning ear-to-ear.




---

Those first two decks of mine were copied from the pages of *InQuest*, as were many of my early decks. But, at some point, I became enamored with finding a different path, with crafting my own decks around unexpected cards. Usually, those cards involved drawing more cards. That's just how I roll.


So I have one more preview today that goes with one more trip down memory lane.


When the original *Ravnica* came out, I was a touch underwhelmed. Not because the set wasn't great (it was a revelation, really), but because I had to wait for *Guildpact* to get Izzet.


Izzet was my true love at the time, even before I knew it. And *Ravnica* had released a card that had caught my imagination even before Izzet came around.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mindmoil)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindmoil)
[Mindmoil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindmoil) didn't draw extra cards, but it did let you look at most of your deck over just a few turns if your *other* cards drew cards. [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research), [Tidings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidings), and friends let you positively tear through your deck to find whatever you needed. Assuming you had a ton of mana. Fortunately (well, for me), these cards were Standard-legal at the time:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urza%27s+Tower)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urza%27s+Mine)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Mine) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urza%27s+Power+Plant)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Power+Plant)
Except it didn't really work to play blue and red together prior to *Guildpact*. So when *Guildpact* came out, I actually managed to trade for four [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) *during the Prerelease*. That's how determined I was. The other card I sought out?


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=96952)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96952)
It was perfect for me—it rewarded you for drawing cards! Throw in [Izzet Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet), and suddenly you could actually play Izzet Tron (in fact, it became a very good, very powerful deck during the time period). Only when everyone else was casting [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) and [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire), I was pairing Niv-Mizzet with [Mindmoil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindmoil) to throw as much as 20 damage at someone in a single turn just by casting a bunch of Signets and draw spells. It was apex value town.


While [Mindmoil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindmoil) won't be joining us in *Masters 25*, we are getting my favorite guild leader back again, complete with the original art and, importantly, the original flavor text:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/a25/en_jtqWuz2KQG.png)


Chills, nostalgia, and memories of *Magic* past. Are these cards modern-day powerhouses? Nope. But they get me. They take me back to different times in my life. Stay tuned for the week of previews, because there are a lot more trips down memory lane to come.
