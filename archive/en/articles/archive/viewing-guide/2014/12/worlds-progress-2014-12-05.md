1 a.m. PT/4 a.m. ET—2014 World *Magic* Cup



**December 7**


12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET—2014 Worlds Week Playoffs





This is the big week. On Tuesday and Wednesday, we witnessed the first two days of competition at the [2014 World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC). In case you missed it (and if you did, FOR SHAME!), the Top 4 features the following:



* The 2012 World Champion (Yuuya Watanabe)
* The 2013 World Champion (Shahar Shenhar)
* The finalist from the 2007 World Championship event (Patrick Chapin)
* The quiet player from Japan who has made his expertise known (Kentaro Yamamoto)


These four players will have their playoff matches on Sunday. But before that…
