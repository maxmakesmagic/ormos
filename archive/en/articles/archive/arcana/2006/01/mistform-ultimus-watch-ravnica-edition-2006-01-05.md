![Mistform Ultimus Watch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/mistformultimuswatch.jpg)Welcome again to Mistform Ultimus Watch! In this recurring sub-feature of Magic Arcana we keep track of *Legions'* legendary Graveborn Jellyfish, [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus), and see what creature types it has gained and/or lost. 

We last checked in with [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus)[after the release of *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/876), and now we stand on the verge of *Guildpact* previews. So as *Ravnica: City of Guilds* has released in the interim, [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) has become an Archon (thanks to [Blazing Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Archon)) and a Lammasu (thanks to [Hunted Lamassu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Lamassu)).

Despite *Ravnica* being full of token creature creators, the Ultimus gained no new creature types through those token types. Although [Tolsimir Wolfblood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolsimir+Wolfblood) creates a creature token named Voja, the token actually has the *creature type* Wolf, so "Voja" hasn't become a creature type in **Magic** (see also [Helm of Kaldra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Kaldra)'s Avatar token).

To date, [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is a Giant Ape Lord, a Slug Tactician, a Tracker Keeper, a Berserker Peacekeeper, a Chimera Island-Fish Dragon Mime, a Beeble Eater, an Elder Gamer Child, and many more...

In sum, as of *Ravnica*, [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is a:
