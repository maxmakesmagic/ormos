AJANI GOLDMANE
==============

This leonin Planeswalker wields spiritual white magic. Once driven by vengeance, he now focuses solely on purification and healing, for the good of all people and planes.


A rare albino leonin, Ajani was born an outcast within his own family. The only person who embraced him was his brother, Jazal, the leader of their pride. When Jazal was assassinated, Ajani's Planeswalker spark ignited. Torn between his leonin ferocity and sense of justice, Ajani embarked on a quest to hunt down his brother's killer.


Trained as a fierce warrior in his brother’s service, Ajani’s inherent magic abilities didn’t fully blossom until his trip to Jund, where he encountered the dragon worshiper Sarkhan Vol. Sarkhan helped Ajani turn his quest for revenge into a fiery new power, unlocking a torrent of red magic to add to Ajani’s white. Breaking beyond his bounds of principle and justice, his new focus was vengeance: spells that punish wrongdoers and lay waste to his enemies.


Meanwhile, bereft of its leader, his pride scattered all over Naya. Ajani, returning to a home that seemed alien to him, began to unravel the mysteries of his brother’s murder. Realizing his role in the elder dragon Nicol Bolas’s plan, he buried his quest for vengeance along with his brother.


Now he remains true to his healing instincts and opposes all those who seek dominion over the innocent. The Multiverse is his home now, and across its planes, tyranny is spreading. Ajani will not rest until the dragon Planeswalker Nicol Bolas and his minions fail.
