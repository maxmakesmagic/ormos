The phrase "Red Zone" has almost become vernacular for **Magic** players, referring to attacking with creatures. But what is the Red Zone?


When **Magic** was being aired on ESPN2, the people in charge wanted a playmat that would make the card layout easy to understand on television. The solution came to be known as the Red Zone, a mat that marks off where each players' lands and non-lands should go, as well as a large red central area for spells on the stack, and - more importantly - for combat.


After the ESPN stint was over, the Red Zone remained a staple of the finals and feature match area. You can see it in pictures of all the coverage of PT-level events on the [Sideboard](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard/coverage).


An overview of the Red Zone playmat:


The playmat was not quite as elegant when it was conceived, however. This drawing shows the first idea for a playmat for use on camera, and it includes many extraneous zones like the "Hand Zone" and the "Artifact & Enchantment" zone. Much too confusing!
