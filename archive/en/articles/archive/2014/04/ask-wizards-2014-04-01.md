| **A: Mike McArtor, copy editor of DailyMTG.com:**
It depends on what you mean by "first."
The first card with [Egg in the name](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Begg%5D) is [Dingus Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dingus+Egg), from Alpha. The first card with [Chicken in the name](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Bchicken%5D) appeared in *Unglued*.
Alphabetically, of course, a Chicken card comes first. In this case, [Chicken à la King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chicken+%C3%A0+la+King).
And if you're looking for "eggs" for your deck, I recommend the winning decklists from [Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptrtr12/top8decks) (Cifka's) and [Grand Prix San Diego](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpsd13/welcome#10) (Holiday's).
