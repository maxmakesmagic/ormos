Alternatively you can go with “Variant Trouncer” if you prefer, both of these are anagrams for *Return to Ravnica*. Anagrams are when you jumble up the letters of a word or phrase and make other words or phrases from them. I've always had a love for anagrams and to this day enjoy playing anagram based word games to pass the time.
