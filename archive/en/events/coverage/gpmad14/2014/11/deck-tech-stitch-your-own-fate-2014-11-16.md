 There is some [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy), after all. We have found it! Or rather, Eduardo Sajgalik and Joao Choca have found it. The two English players came up with a brand new version of the deck. "It's true. The old version wasn't good enough, but this one is," said Eduardo Sajgalik.




 Both players made it to Day 2 and when I spoke to them, Joao Choca was 9-1. The big change in their list is, they cut [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and added [Fatestitcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatestitcher). "We also changed a lot of the card draw, basically replaced all the Wisps in the original build," Sajgalik added. In their version, [Fatestitcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatestitcher) is put into the graveyard with the help of [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting), [Thought Scour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Scour), [Ideas Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound), or [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) itself, of course, and then acts as a mana creature with haste that costs one blue mana.
