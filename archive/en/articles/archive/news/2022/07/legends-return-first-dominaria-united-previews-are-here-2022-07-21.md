Legends Return: The First *Dominaria United* Previews Are Here
==============================================================



 Posted in **News**
 on July 21, 2022

By Adam Styborski




 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






Where it all began.



![Dominaria United Plains](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/XOX5qbqRop.jpg)Art by: [Lorenzo Lanfranconi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Lorenzo%20Lanfranconi%22%5D)
30 years ago, a high fantasy plane set the stage for the battles of planeswalkers and titans of wizardry. It was filled with elves and goblins and dragons and angels spread across beautiful landscapes where the crack of spellcasting could be heard. Evocative and inviting, the rich depth of stories to be told was just beginning to be realized.


Dominaria, after all, is the legendary setting for the first *Magic* release nearly 30 years ago.



![Dominaria United Mountain](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/CkOWtc0qDv.jpg)Art by: [Johannes Voss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Johannes%20Voss%22%5D)
Today, *Magic* has shared dozens of planes—far-flung locations across the Multiverse, each a fantastical setting in its own right—but its *home* has always been Dominaria. For our 30th anniversary, and the start of our latest arc of story, *Magic* returns here with *Dominaria United* releasing September 9, 2022.

Check with your local store for more information.


The *Dominaria United* Story
============================


On August 10, with the final beat publishing when the Wizards Presents broadcast arrives on August 18, the *Dominaria United* story begins following Karn as he looks back on Dominaria's past to prepare for its future. This sets the stage for the story unfolding over four sets—starting here with *Dominaria United*—and returns with familiar faces from our last visit.

Visit [DailyMTG](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles) beginning August 10 to read the start of an epic arc that kicks off with *Dominaria United*.


A Preview of What's to Come
===========================


When we visited the plane last in the eponymous set *Dominaria*, the skies were bright and full of hope for an even brighter future. So what question is Karn trying to answer?


![Evolved Sleeper](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_aiqcG2oIuM.png)![Extended-art Evolved Sleeper](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_7ocCOOENd0.png)


The enemy is already on Dominaria, and it's only a matter of time before conflict breaks out.

When Wizards Presents kicks off on August 18, the *Dominaria United* story will be complete, and we'll share even more previews from the set.


Lost *Legends*
==============


*Dominaria United* is an inflection point between celebrating Dominaria's past and looking ahead to the future with a story that crosses into the Multiverse. *Magic* turns 30 years old in 2023, and we're kicking off *Magic: The Gathering*'s 30th Anniversary Celebration with *Dominaria United*.


We're making it legendary, literally, with a few special features for this release.


The first among these is one of most exciting additions to sets ever: ***Dominaria United* Collector Boosters featuring cards from physical *Legends* boosters printed in 1994**.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1690)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1690) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1626)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1626) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1672)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1672)
*Legends* cards such as those—and many more—will appear only in *Dominaria United* Collector Boosters, and we're serious that we pulled these from *Legends* boosters. You can see a video of boosters being opened and learn more about this addition to *Dominaria United* Collector Boosters with [Blake Rasmussen's breakdown of what *Legends* cards you can find](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/lost-legends-2022-07-21).


A Legendary Experience
======================


Collector Boosters aren't the only boosters we're ensuring have exciting things to open.


In *Dominaria United*, the "legends in every pack" we featured with the *Dominaria* release is back: this time Set, Draft, and Collector Boosters will contain a legendary card in each booster, showing off a cast of beloved legends and characters that longtime fans will recognize. There are more than 40 legendary creatures across the set, with surprising appearances for new and longtime fans to discover.


![Braids Dominaria United artwork](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/X2WP2bSLN8.jpg)


And we're not done yet.


Legends Retold Box Toppers
==========================


Box Toppers return for *Dominaria United* and can be found with each Set, Draft, and Collector Booster display! Legends Retold Box Toppers contain one traditional foil card from among 19 legendary creatures and one planeswalker, each a new design inspired by a legendary creature found in the original *Legends* set. (These new cards will be available in *Dominaria United* Collector Boosters in both non-foil and foil-etched versions as well.)

Those are just three of the 20 available, with more deep cuts and throwbacks we'll show off later.


*Dominaria United* Jumpstart Boosters
=====================================


Jumpstart Boosters return with *Dominaria United*, joining Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters as a booster type for upcoming premier sets. Featuring two foil basic lands, two rares—one new rare unique to this Jumpstart Booster release and one rare or mythic rare from *Dominaria United*—and 20 total *Magic* cards. There are ten themes—two for each of the five colors—to mix, shuffle, and play:


* **White**: Coalition Corps and Coalition Legions
* **Blue**: Mystic Mischief and Arcane Mischief
* **Black**: Totally Ruthless and Totally Merciless
* **Red**: Ready to Charge and Ready to Attack
* **Green**: Beast Territory and Monster Territory

Two Jumpstart Boosters are all anyone needs to jump into playing *Magic* and provide another way to join in the *Dominaria United* Prerelease action September 2–8.


Plus, one of the non-foil basic lands in each *Dominaria United* Jumpstart Booster features the showcase stained-glass treatment.


Stained-Glass Treatment
=======================


Wait—*showcase stained-glass treatment*? We'll let their beauty speak for themselves with the five stained-glass basic lands, available in both foil and non-foil.


![Dominaria United Showcase Plains](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_4rZ2sMu7Cd.png)![Dominaria United Showcase Island](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_f9iRpJshmZ.png)![Dominaria United Showcase Swamp](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_g7G8oDZaDT.png)


![Dominaria United Showcase Mountain](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_I9ds6AODXi.png)![Dominaria United Showcase Forest](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_qbx7r5Cv51.png)


We'll share all the ways you can find these basic lands—plus more cards that feature this treatment—when *Dominaria United* previews begin with Wizards Presents on August 18.


*Dominaria United* Commander
============================


Legendary characters as legendary creatures continue with *Dominaria United* Commander, two ready-to-play decks that release alongside *Dominaria United* on September 9. These decks feature new versions of two Dominaria characters we saw in *Modern Horizons 2*:


* **Legends' Legacy**, a red-white-black deck with Dihada
* **Painbow**, a five-color deck with Jared Carthalion

![Legends' Legacy Commander deck](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_R7yhiMpsOS.png)![Painbow Commander deck](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_P3TJVdcaLc.png)

![Jared Carthalion artwork](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/orhr1rroIl.jpg)


*Dominaria United* Commander decks are 100-card, ready-to-play decks, each featuring two foil cards and several new *Magic* cards to expand your collection. Additionally, each Commander deck includes a Collector Booster Sample Pack: a two-card pack containing a taste of what you can find in *Dominaria United* Collector Boosters, including a card in the beautiful stained-glass treatment as well as a rare or mythic rare (either in traditional foil or non-foil) from the set.


We'll show off the new Dihada and Jared cards when *Dominaria United* previews begin with Wizards Presents on August 18, then share more new *Dominaria United* Commander cards and the complete decklists on August 19.


Next Stop: Wizards Presents
===========================


While we have plenty of *Dominaria United* left to show you, the August 18 broadcast of Wizards Presents is so much more. It's our biggest day of announcements yet, showing off upcoming releases for *Magic: The Gathering* and *Dungeons & Dragons* with exclusive looks into what's to come for the next year from us here at Wizards of the Coast.

![Upcoming Magic Releases Timeline](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/n5cHBFeJ5d.jpg)


Watch as we open the curtain and reveal what's behind these codenames with Wizards Presents—followed by the first day of previews for *Dominaria United*—on August 18!


. . . Just One More Thing
=========================


We said *Dominaria United* is the beginning of *Magic: The Gathering*'s 30th Anniversary Celebration, and it's not just what you can find inside *Dominaria United*. Prerelease events are designed as the fun, first ways to play with new *Magic* sets at your local game store, and the next eight upcoming Prerelease event weekends add something special to the mix.


![30th Anniversary promo Serra Angel](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/aCMpytAg5x.png)![30th Anniversary promo Ball Lightning](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/AqDIHLP0tv.png)![30th Anniversary promo Fyndhorn Elves](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/K5mJLH50My.png)


These are the first three of the 30 promo cards available at Prerelease events, celebrating each of *Magic*'s 30 years. Each promo card is a reprint, chosen from and releasing in chronological order by the year it was first printed. Some promos will be rarer than others, and while many of these promo cards will be in English only, seven will only be available in another language where *Magic* is available—the first being Fyndhorn Elves available only in German as shown above!


You'll need to visit and register for Prerelease events at your local game store, beginning with *Dominaria United* September 2–8, to learn how you can pick up these incredible promo cards.

That's it for today—phew! We'll see you August 18 for Wizards Presents and the kickoff of *Dominaria United* previews!
