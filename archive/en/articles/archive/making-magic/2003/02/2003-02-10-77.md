It’s time for your design meeting. This design is for a game other than **Magic**. While you spend a great deal of time working on **Magic**, you also spend a significant portion of your time working on other games. This additional responsibility has numerous benefits. First, it spices things up so that you have different types of projects to work on. Second, things learned in the design of other games help you with your **Magic** design. Many ideas have started off as cards in another card game.

The meeting takes a few hours. You have a good time and the team comes up with some very innovative ideas. All you have to do now is go convince that games’ brand team that this innovative new idea is what the project needs. All in all, a good meeting.
