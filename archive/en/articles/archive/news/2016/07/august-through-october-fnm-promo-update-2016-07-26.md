It's almost August, so it's time to announce the promos that Friday Night *Magic* players can look forward to over the next three months. They are shiny, and soon they can all be yours.


**August**


As if you need another reason to side with the Eldrazi. July was [Spatial Contortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spatial+Contortion), this month is one of the best ways to cast it. Throw in a touch of colored mana, and you have a pretty versatile land with pretty art from one Jonas De Ro.

**September**


The Eldrazi hits just keep on coming. Didn't the Gatewatch win? Yet here we are months later still facing down some [Flaying Tendrils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaying+Tendrils) with new art from Svetlin Velinov.

**October**


It can't be all Eldrazi all the timeâ€”at some point the heroes of the story were going to rise up. It's just that, well, this time the heroes were Zombies, and they're rising from the tides in this premium foil version of [Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) with art from Lucas Graciano.
