### PRO TOUR KHANS OF TARKIR


SULTAI - SEALED SECRETSSS
=========================

October 11, 2014
 










I like to think if you're here right now reading this, you're like me, and you're a fan of Sultai. Otherwise you're here to steal our secretsss! Guards! Get them! Take them away! Okay, now that we that sorted, let's get down to business.


Me, I like Sultai because it feels like they're breaking some of the fundamental rules of *Magic*. The green lets us get extra mana, the blue lets us get extra cards, and the black lets us make use of those cards others might consider already well-used. There's a reason our ancestral home land is an [Opulent Palace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opulent+Palace).


So what can the Sultai clan do for you? I guess the question is how much do you want? Because if you want it all, I feel like you've come to right place. I've lined up some of our more powerful Mages to give you the run-down of the Sultai way of life. And I guess way of death; it's all the same to us.


14th-ranked Samuel Black is a self confessed Sultai devotee, so I approached him under the misty jungle canopy amongst the incessant buzz of insects.


"I definitely tried testing a few different Sultai decks for this tournament," he explained, "doing some pretty powerful things around [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and using [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) to bring them online earlier, but it turned out those cards were good enough without green, and in the end, I felt like I needed something more explosive for this tournament. I also tried [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant), [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen), and even [Endless Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Obedience) and [Nyx Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx+Weaver). The key card was always [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) for that kind of thing."


And we can't fault Black for ending up away from the Sultai, having finished 6-2 on Day One, including going 2-1 in draft with Sultai. "I opened a couple of good green-blue rares and only lost to a strong Mardu tokens combo draft deck, so that was pretty good."


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/ptktk/samblack_sultai.jpg)*I like that the Sultai reuses their graveyard. They use every piece of the buffalo.*




Someone who dodged dying to the Mardu token menace was Greg Orange, who rattled off a solid 3-0 with his Sultai draft deck. "I don't have a preference for it, I just opened some good black cards and Sultai ended up open," he admitted with a shrug. "I almost decked myself in Round 1. I just kept killing my opponent's creatures and almost ran out of cards before I got him. But I got him."



Orange's deck shows how a more focused draft deck can look in *Khans of Tarkir* can look. More of a two-color deck with a splash than a true three-color deck.
