### Game 1

Chambers shot off a first turn Cabal Therapy naming a Wild Mongrel. He caught one, too. He followed it up with a turn two Withered Wretch. Freedman drew and cast another Mongrel, and when Chambers attempted to remove it with Chainer’s Edict, had a Basking Rootwalla to take the bullet for it. Freedman did not have a third land, but he cast a Merfolk Looter which would likely soon let him draw into some land. Chambers answered by summoning a Graveborn Muse. 

Freedman summoned a second Wild Mongrel. Having drawn three cards on his turn, Chambers cast a Rotlung Reanimator, then sacrificed it to recash Cabal Therapy and yank both Phantom Centaurs out of his opponent’s hand. Freedman did some card drawing of his own, tapping out for Deep Analysis, then Chambers regained life points going up to seventeen when he cast Corrupt on the Looter. Chambers summoned a Rotlung Reanimator and used it and a Withered Wretch to block Basking Rootwalla and one of the three Wild Mongrels that were now attacking him. 

Having drawn many extra cards, Chambers discarded his opponent’s entire hand, then used Mutilate to clear the table. He played a Shade, attacked with it for a ton of damage, and summoned a second Shade. Unable to block both on the following turn, Freedman packed up his cards.

Sideboard

Chambers: +2 Engineered Plague, +1 Visara, + 1 Smother, +1 Mutilate, - 1 Corrupt, -2 Cabal Therapy, -2 Chainer’s Edict  
 Freedman: -2 Wonder, -1 Basking Rootwalla, -1 Roar of the Wurm, -2 Circular Logic, -1 Quiet Speculation, +2 Stupefying Touch, +2 Turbulent Dreams, +2 Counterpsell, +1 Unsummon

### Game 2

Chambers kept a one land hand made work by a pair of Careful Studies he was holding. Indeed, he was able to draw into plenty of lands over the first two turns with them, as well as put a free Basking Rootwalla into play. Freedman opened with a Nantuko Shade. He then cast Duress, which was countered with Circular Logic and used Smother to kill a Wild Mongrel and attack with his Shade. 

Once Phantom Centaur entered play, Chambers was forced to trade two for two with Mutilate. He then dropped a Graveborn Muse into play and began riding the card economy of it again. Chambers played out his entire hand, killing his opponent’s only creature in play and summoning a Withered Wretch. Chambers used Stupefying Touch on the Wretch then cast a Basking Rootwalla. 

Drawing lots of cards off the Muse, Chambers was able to play Zombie after Zombie. He was at a fairly low life total himself at this point though, which gave Chambers a chance to take the game yet. The life totals were five for Freedman and eight for Chambers, with five Zombies in play. Freedman spent a lot of time thinking about this play, but finally let his opponent take his turn, holding back his Unsummon and hoping to stop just enough damage next turn to make Chambers die to his own Muse.

This was not to be though. One of the cards Chambers drew was Cabal Therapy. If nothing else, he could now sacrifice the Muse to the Therapy and prevent taking any further damage. Therapy hit the Unsummon and Chambers used his remaining mana to flash back Chainer’s Edict. He attacked with all of his creatures, dealing lethal damage.
