 Grand Prix Baltimore marked David Foster's first Day 2, his first Top 8, and now his first finals appearance. His Abzan deck, featuring strong clan rares in [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), had quickly dispatched Chris Fennell in the quarterfinals, and outlasted Harry Bradford in a long three-game semifinals. He was looking to make it the perfect weekend by adding first-time Grand Prix champion to that list against Gerard Fabiano in the finals.




 Fabiano, already a two-time Grand Prix champion, was trying to add a third trophy to his crowded mantle. His Sultai deck managed first to take down Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze* Champion Craig Wescoe courtesy of a timely [Blinding Spray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Spray) in the quarterfinals. The competition didn't get any easier next round when he sat down across from Hall of Famer Ben Stark, but with help from a [Sultai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Charm) on [Raiders' Spoils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raiders%27+Spoils) and a hexproof [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler), Fabiano was on to the finals.




**The Games**




 Fabiano kept his opening seven, while Foster mulliganed first to six, and then to five, before finally keeping. The game started out slowly. Foster managed to summon a steady stream of threats given that he started with a two-card deficit, but Fabiano, for the time being, had all the answers. Foster's [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) suffered a [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury), and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) was [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle)d.
