You cheered Sarkhan on, even when things looked bleak. When asked if you chose Khans or Dragons, you answered with an unflinching, unwavering "Dragons." At long last, Sarkhan has successfully altered the timeline, leaving Tarkir heavy on the dragons—just how he likes it. Bask in the reflective glory of their terrible flame and celebrate with *Dragons of Tarkir* Prerelease and Release Events!


[Prerelease Events](#prerelease) begin Friday, April 3, at 10:00 a.m. and run until Monday, April 6, at 10:00 a.m. *Magic Online* players will have a chance to draft every Dragon they see in the [Prerelease Swiss Draft](#preswissdraft), or you can choose your clan and pick up the associated "Battle" Prerelease object to compete in two varieties of Prerelease Sealed Events going on throughout the weekend: [Competitive](#competitivesealed) and [Friendly](#friendlysealed). When choosing your "Battle" object, you may notice that your favorite clans have changed since the last Prerelease. Refer to the table below to decide which of the Dragon Lords you wish to throw your support behind.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Battle" Entry Object | Corresponding Clan | Clan Colors |
| Battle with Endurance | Dromoka | Green and White |
| Battle with Cunning | Ojutai | White and Blue |
| Battle with Ruthlessness | Silumgar | Blue and Black |
| Battle with Speed | Kolaghan | Black and Red |
| Battle with Savagery | Atarka | Red and Green |

While Dragons are in no way friendly, the Prerelease Friendly Sealed Event is being held to help the Dragon-challenged acquaint themselves with the new set in a low-risk scenario. The Competitive Prerelease Sealed Event is for those who, like the majestic sultans of the sky, prefer their opposition demolished and their spoils vast. When you enter one of the Prerelease Sealed Events, you will receive four regular packs of *Dragons of Tarkir*, one special seeded *Dragons of Tarkir* booster, and one *Fate Reforged* booster pack. The seeded booster contains a run of commons and uncommons from the clan corresponding to your selected "Battle" object, as well as one foil rare or mythic rare that is also associated with your chosen clan. Participation in any Prerelease Event will reward players with a Sarkhan Unbroken avatar. Once Prerelease Events end on Monday, April 6, 10:00 a.m., Release Events begin!


Beginning at 10:00 a.m. Monday, April 6, Release Events run until the downtime on Wednesday, April 22. Release Queue events run on demand and will be available for the duration of the Release. Be sure to check out the *Dragons of Tarkir*/*Fate Reforged* Pack Per Win Event, a new addition to our Release Queue repertoire. Two scheduled Release events, the 64-Player with Top 8 Draft and the Swiss Sealed with Top 8 Events, will also be running at regularly scheduled times in the Scheduled Events room, so keep your eye on those too. Participating in any Release Event is rewarded with a Narset Transcendent avatar for your collection!


**Note:** Prizes for some Release Events were updated during the Wednesday, April 15, downtime. Refer to the Tuesday, April 14, Weekly Announcements [Blog](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-april-14-2015) for more details.
