Â 


Long before Mirrodin existed, on the other side of the multiverse, there was Kamigawa -- a plane in the midst of a terrible war. Spirits are launching attacks against humans as, in the shadows, a terror lurks just beyond sight.


A gang of akki goblins try to flee from an angry ice spirit that appears from out of nowhere. A cloud of bizarre creatures emerge from a samurai's heirloom lanter, attacking him while he sleeps. At the Minamo School, students of wizardry fight nonstop to stem a flow of strange beings that materialize from within the Great Waterfall.


The war with the Spirit World continues.  
**Meet the Champions of Kamigawa!**
