 Yichao is a writer of words for plays, television, theme parks, and—most recently—Magic: The Gathering. He loves Cube Draft and corgis. 






Some of the most exciting aspects of *Battle for Zendikar* are the awesome full-art lands. By now, you've probably seen all of the full-art lands for yourself—and if you haven't, you can check out the [*Battle for Zendikar* site](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/battle-zendikar-cards) for a full card list. However, I'll bet you haven't seen the in-progress sketches of these lands!


Check out the beautiful art of some *Battle for* *Zendikar* lands below, and see how they evolved from first sketch to finished piece. It's fun to note which pieces had major compositional shifts and which ones had more subtle evolutions.


To see the sketch and the final, simply click and hold the arrows in the middle of the image and drag side-to-side.
