Dutchies Dominate Malmo!
========================




July 22-23, 2006











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmalm06/fin.jpg)Grand Prix Malmo is over.


Outside it's been a hot sunny day in Sweden, but inside players got to feel the chill as *Coldsnap* debuted on the Grand Prix circuit for the first time. But first the 534 players had to navigate a day of *Ravnica* Sealed deck. Day one was not without incident, with the biggest news provided by the shock disqualification of top European pro Olivier Ruel.


64 players returned today for the ripple fuelled craziness that is *Coldsnap* draft. Stories abounded of [Thrumming Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrumming+Stone)s and 9 Disciples of Tevesh Szat, or a first-striking army of 9 [Surging Sentinels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surging+Sentinels) appearing on turn 3.


In the end the Dutchies were dominant as the Netherlands put 4 players - Wessel Oomens, Kamiel Cornelissen, Jelger Wiegersma and Wilco Pinkster - into a very experienced top 8 that also included Worlds top 8'er André Coimbra and PT top 8'er Vasilis Fatouros. Scandinavia was also represented by amateurs Asbjørn Fallesen of Denmark and Axel Berglund of the host nation.


In the end it came down to a clash of swamps between Vasilis Fatouros and Wessel Oomens. Fatouros was running [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s for a removal suite that included 4 [Surging Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surging+Flame)s while Oomens had blue for a collection of [Krovikan Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Mist). In Game 1 Fatouros's draw was too powerful, but Oomens was able to level the match through the aid of a [Tresserhorn Skyknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tresserhorn+Skyknight) that just wouldn't stay dead (or undead). Game 3 the Dutchman managed to overcome a double mulligan to claim his first Grand Prix title through the aid of his evasion monsters and removal.


Congratulations to Wessel Oomens, champion of Grand Prix Malmo!

Sunday, July 23: 6:20 p.m. - Top 8 Draft - Jelger Wiegersma
-----------------------------------------------------------


Jelger opted for the snow strategy, drafting as many snow lands and [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North) he could. Unfortunately, it didn't pay off so well as his deck is lacking power cards and real ways to take advantage of his Snow mana base. Only 2 [Rimewind Taskmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimewind+Taskmage)s and a single [Chilling Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chilling+Shade) which go well with the icy lands.


However, he drafted 4 [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+North), which would allow him to reach his 5th and 6th mana faster and thus play one of his two [Adarkar Windform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Windform) and [Ronom Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronom+Serpent)s a turn or two earlier. This boost of mana will also allow him to keep his 3 Survivors of the Unseen around so they can grant him more card advantage.


During the last pack, he picked a [Frost Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Raptor) over a [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred), as he needed ways to actually win the game, giving up a precious removal spell that his deck is lacking so much.


Overall, an average deck missing key cards but that can surprise his opponent with a fast [Ronom Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronom+Serpent) or overwhelm him with the help of his Survivors.


He will be facing fellow Dutchman and GP Paris Winner Wilco Pinkster in the quarters. Let's wish him a lot of luck!
