================================

We caught up with Huang Hao-Shan during initial *M15* Sealed deckbuilding period. Huang won GP Taipei (*M15* Sealed) three weeks ago, so we're guessing he knows a thing or two about the format. Huang also has three other GP top-8s to his name, including 5th place at GP Brisbane in 2011.


Huang told us that he believed *M15* Sealed to be an aggressive format that is heavily influenced by the bombs that can overwhelm the commons and uncommons in the set. As such, he's very happy about his sealed pool, which features a plethora of two drops backed by several impressive bombs.

*Huang Hao-Shan talks Neale Talbot through the fine art of Magic 2015 sealed deck.*

Huang has high regard for two drops in *M15* Sealed, calling them the key to the format. Not only do they allow for early board control, they also combo with the core mechanic, convoke, allowing for plays that provide a powerful tempo boost early in the game, from which opponents may be unable to recover.



Haung had a lot of options with his sealed pool, almost able to put together two completely different decks. After finalising his decklist, Haung demonstrated how he would plan for three key matchups - against aggro, against tokens, and against control. His ability to side into a new colour in some matchups, bring in vital sideboard cards in others, or to shift his mana curve away from two drops to late-game fatties, should provide him a great deal of flexibility in his coming matches.


With a fresh Grand Prix win in Taipei, a great sealed pool, and an aggressive deck, we'll be keeping a close eye on how Haung Hau-Shan progresses over the weekend.
