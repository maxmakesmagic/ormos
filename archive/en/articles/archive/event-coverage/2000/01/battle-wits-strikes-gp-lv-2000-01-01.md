When informed of the deck, Brian Kibler and "Baby Huey" Jensen, felt the need to rush over and watch the teetering pile of cards stacked high upon the table. While it failed to secure him any byes, the deck did remarkably well, scoring a 3-3-2 overall record (28th place) and getting him a great deal of attention. 


Kurtis Hahn, (founder of the 5-color movement) remained unavailable for comment.
