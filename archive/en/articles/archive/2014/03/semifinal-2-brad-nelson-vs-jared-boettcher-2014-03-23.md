After the quarterfinals Brad Nelson just went through, you can't really blame him for needing a smoke. Heck, I don't smoke and I could use one.


But having battled through an Esper Mirror, facing Jared Boettcher's Black White Devotion deck in the semifinals must feel like a treat, even if the matchup was still a tricky one.


With Pro Tour invitations secured, Boettcher and Nelson were playing not just for a trophy, but for their legacies and reputations. Boettcher is smack in the middle of the Rookie of the Year race, and following up a 9th place finish at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* with this performance was cementing his reputation in the eyes of a lot of people.


Boettcher's white splash even gave him a leg up on Mono Black versions of this deck, as [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) and [Revoke Existence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revoke+Existence), both main, would prove troublesome for Nelson. Boettcher also had some bothersome sideboard cards as well, with a pair of [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) catching Nelson's eye early on.


"Only two!" he said, excitedly.


"Isn't [Sin Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sin+Collector) better against you anyway?" Boettcher asked.


Brad's face fell a bit. He hadn't noticed the [Sin Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sin+Collector)s.


But we should all know not to count out Nelson in a Standard GP at this point. He has proved countless times that, no matter the odds, he's a pretty strong bet to come out on top.


**The games**


An early [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) gave Boettcher all of the information he needed while stripping Nelson of a key Jace, but his follow-up of attacking with two [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s revealed a weak hand, a weakness Nelson looked to exploit when he promptly drew a second Jace.


That Jace offered up yet a third Jace, which Nelson was happy to snap up and start defending on the following turn. Everything was turning up Nelson.


The best Boettcher could do while Nelson was racing through his deck was a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), far from the most frightening card against Esper. And even less frightening when Nelson can throw down Elspeth in front of the rats.

When the rats appeared unable to break through at any point, Boettcher tried a new path and slapped a [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) onto the table, giving Nelson some pause. He had an Elspeth in play that could easily handle the [Blood Baron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa), but only at the cost of not making soldiers to block [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat).


 


Nelson did eventually chose to kill the [Blood Baron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) that way and handle [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) with [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), but called himself an idiot repeatedly when his Jace—activated after the flurry of removal—turned up a [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) that would have done the job all by itself.


Consequently, Nelson lost his Jace to to [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) attacks and his Elspeth to the same following a [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight). Because he had casually expended his resources in a game he was far ahead, Nelson had suddenly come crashing back down to earth.


Until, you know, second Elspeth.


After fighting through Nelson's commanding board position and spotting two Revelations and an [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) still waiting in Nelson's hand—thanks to [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)—Boettcher chose to concede a game that hadn't been much in his favor at any point.


"I drew the wrong half of my deck that game," Boettcher mused, furrowing his brow while scanning his sideboard.


It turned out Boettcher had kept a hand of four Swamp, two [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and, predictably, hadn't gotten very far with it. He simply didn't think he'd get a better five card hand.


The second game started much better for Boettcher, as early disruption gave way to an unmolested [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) that started spawning copies almost immediately. He followed them up with a [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa), threatening to run away with the game. Nelson, unfortunately for him, was already down two [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)s and badly in need of another.


Instead he had Elsepth, Sun's Champion. The Planeswalker may not have been long for this world since nothing in play could stop the Baron, but it did buy a few precious turns for Nelson to fire off [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for four.


The draw spell didn't turn up any help, and neither did the Jace that followed. No Verdict, no [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)—no help of any kind. He would be dead very, very quickly without some kind of major help.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead)
Boettcher, smelling blood (like his Baron, I suppose), made another rat and called upon [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead) for some divine intervention.


But it was Nelson who found reprieve, as [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) leapt from the top of his deck to his hand and, ultimately, to the battlefield. Suddenly Nelson had new life.


Nelson still had a long way to fight back, though. [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead) started drawing Boettcher cards, and he had ample life to continue drawing cards with the God.


Down, out, and empty handed, Nelson needed a ton of help from Jace if he was going to survive.


What he got was a miracle.


Jace revealed [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), [Revoke Existence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revoke+Existence) and Elspeth—and Nelson roared with appreciation as he scooped up the two white cards. He suddenly had a threat, a defensive play, AND a way to remove [Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead).


Just like that, Nelson, so far behind for so very, very long, was in full command of the game. Jace had turned up exactly the cards Nelson wanted at exactly the moment Nelson needed them. A few turns later, just as Nelson was about to put the game away, Jace revealed three winners again—two [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) and an [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm). Nelson rocked back and clapped his hands one last time.


"I can't seem to catch a break," Boettcher said, surveying a game that had somehow found a way to slip away from him.
