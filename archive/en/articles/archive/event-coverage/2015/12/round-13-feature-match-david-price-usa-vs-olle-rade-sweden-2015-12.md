For the winner, a chance to make top 8, for the loser, top 16 is the best he can manage. These 2 past masters have not met to their recollection although Olle said he had past memories of Jackal Pups beating him down, Dave ironically denied any knowledge of ever playing with Jackal Pup and they prepared to play game 1.



**Game 1**


Dave won the dice roll and elected to begin, unsurprisingly. As he looked at his opening hand, he said, 'It's good, it's just not gonna beat you'. After Mulliganing to 6, his hand was much better, except his only land was a Wasteland. His 5 card hand was 4 land and an Incinerate. Olle kept his hand and they started. The first spell Dave tried to cast was a turn 4 Ball Lightning, which was promptly Force of Willed. Meanwhile Olle was gasing up his hand with Impulses and gushes. Dave managed to get an Agent of Stromgald into play, but it was Kegged away soon after. Olle then dropped the Stasis. Many turns later Olle let the Stasis go. Dave made a valiant attempt to burn him out, but the next turn Olle gets the Morphling from an Impulse, and keeps himself alive with counters while beating Dave to death.



**Game 2**


Dave again opened with a Mulligan, but kept his 6-card hand. He cast an Agent and said go. Olle played a land and said go. Dave tried to consult, but Olle Forced it, and countered a second Agent on turn 3. Daves turn 5 Ball Lightning was hard cast foiled. Some turns passed when nothing happened, but when they fought over the Masticore, Dave with Mages Contest and Olle with Force of Will/ Hydroblast Dave's counter was outclassed and the Masticore hit play. Dave double Fireblasted trying to get rid of the core which had put him to 10 life, but both were countered. At 6 life Dave consulted for a Mogg Fanatic and used it and Incinerate to kill the Masticore. The game entered top deck mode, but with Olle having Gush as one of his first top decks, his hand was significantly more powerful than Dave. Olle made a second Masticore which got Incinerated and Shocked out, and then played a third.



He killed Dave with the 4th Masticore in his hand. In short Dave lost to poor draws, and some very good play from Olle.



**Final Result:** Dave Price 0 - 2 Olle Rade
