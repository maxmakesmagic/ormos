![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpdfw13/melissa_qh.jpg)***Pro Tour *Gatecrash* Quarterfinalist Melissa DeTora**: I actually got in on Thursday, so I had no issues at all.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpdfw13/owen_qh.jpg)***No. 12 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald**: Not that bad. Getting to the site from the airport was much harder than getting to Dallas Fort Worth Airport. I had to take a bus to another bus to a light rail, and from there I had to walk six blocks, but after that it wasn't so bad.*

I drove to Vermont because the flights were cheap, then I flew to New York. Then I flew until I was a few hundred miles from Dallas before the airport closed, so I flew back to New York. I got onto a flight to Houston and then drove all night from there. The drive was supposed to be about three and a half hours but it was about double that. I was pushing pick-up trucks out of ditches, or people would get stuck on bridges and we'd have to wait or push them out.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpdfw13/fennell_qh.jpg)***Grand Prix Indianapolis 2012 Finalist Chris Fennell**: The trip was very long. I woke up at 4:30am and drove three hours to Tampa. They delayed the flight because of maintenance, but once that was done, Dallas delayed the flight because the flights got pushed back. I got here about an hour and a half late. We got in at 3:15pm but didn't get to the hotel until 8:15pm. It was a very long day, but I can't complain really because some people weren't able to get here.*

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpdfw13/huey_qh.jpg)***Hall of Famer William “Huey” Jensen**: It was a bit of an adventure. I flew from Providence, to Atlanta, to Houston, and then drove to Dallas. The first few miles [driving] were fine but the last twenty miles took about an hour.*
