### Collector's Highlights


We have gathered four of the best decks from the 2002 World Championships held in Sydney, Australia. Each of these decks were constructed by a Pro Tour player for the Standard Environment at the time (Invasion through Judgment). Each deck features a 60 card main deck, 15 card sideboard, and 12 proxy cards along with a decklist, and factsheet. These cards are gold bordered and feature the 2002 World Championship Deck backing.
