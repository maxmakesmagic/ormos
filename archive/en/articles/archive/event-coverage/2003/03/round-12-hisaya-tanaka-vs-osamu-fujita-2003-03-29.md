A mop of slack, jet-black hair always hides his sunken eyes, and even when he smiles it's more like a jack-o-lantern than pure friendliness. Nevertheless, under his gruff exterior is a heart of gold. Somewhere. His opponent is Hisaya Tanaka, one of Japan's top-ranked limited players. Unsurprisingly, both of these heavyweights were in pod one.

### Game 1

Fujita started things with a mulligan. His six cards yielded two lands, and he kept. He started with [Goblin Turncoat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Turncoat), and facing no play from Tanaka and no third land he let out a huge sigh and dropped [Skinthinner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner) face-up on the table.

Tanaka had no trouble hitting three lands of three different colors, and started with a morph. Fujita smashed for four and passed it back. Tanaka added a [Vile Deacon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Deacon). He traded it with the Turncoat, and Fujita showed that he'd drawn [Barren Moor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Moor). [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) from Tanaka shut down the rest of Fujita's offense. He made a [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) only to have it trumped by [Gluttonous Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie).

Fujita found a fourth land and played a [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard). Tanaka's team attacked and Fujita tried to double-team the Zombie. Tanaka flipped over [Skirk Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder). Adding injury to injury, he put a [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard) on the table, out-gunning Fujita four-to-one. [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna) from Fujita threatened to make it interesting, but he was at six and Tanaka found the "Attack with everyone" Fujita fell to one, and then scooped.

Tanaka 1 – Fujita 0

### Game 2

Game 2 was Tanaka's turn to mulligan, as his unstable mana failed him. He managed a [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker), but was soon under fire from a morph and [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard). He spent his third turn cycling [Gempalm Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Avenger), then put [Sandskin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandskin) on Fujita's morph. It was far from a lightning opener. [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) came to his aid.

Fujita was content to serve in the air for two while he built his forces. [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) made sure nothing would come through on the ground. Tanaka tried [Gluttonous Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie). Fujita dropped [Berserk Murlodont](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk+Murlodont) and swung in with his Mauler. Tanaka double-blocked with Defender and Zombie, losing the Defender. He hit with the Zombie and then tapped six.

[Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel). The crowd gasped. Fujita rolled his eyes. He needed outs, and fast. He hit with his Murlodont, knocking Tanaka to nine, and readied a [Patron of the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild). His five mana meant it would have to wait until next turn to help the Buzzard finish off the Angel. Fortunately, Tanaka didn't have a trick, and the Angel dropped. The scores were fourteen to three. Tanaka finished off the Buzzard with [Crown of Suspicion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Suspicion). If Fujita couldn't answer the Zombie, he was done.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkyo03/a925.jpg)Fujita drew, played a land, and passed it back. Tanaka sent the Zombie. Fujita flipped up his [Sandskin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandskin)ned morph: [Fallen Cleric](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Cleric). That seemed to turn the tide. All Tanaka had was a [Wall of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Hope), and Fujita started dropping beasts. First [Needleshot Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needleshot+Gourna), then [Symbiotic Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Beast). Tanaka drew blanks. When [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle) hit play as a 10/10, Tanaka knew to pack it up.

Tanaka 1 – Fujita 1

### Game 3

Fujita pulled up his hand for Game 3 and paused. Six land and a [Goblin Turncoat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Turncoat). He wanted to keep it, hoping for spell draws, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He sent it back, and his reward was a one-lander. He went to five. Tanaka remained impassive.

His two lands found a third on the third turn, but it was [Barren Moor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Moor). Tanaka got a morph on the board, and then answered Fujita's once-amplified [Embalmed Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler) with [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender). Fujita found a fourth land and went for [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard), hoping for a fifth to let him have his [Fallen Cleric](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Cleric). In the meantime he took a fair bit of damage.

When his fifth land wasn't forthcoming he morphed the Cleric, and lost it to [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock). [Gluttonous Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie) joined Tanaka's team, and he uncloaked [Boneknitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneknitter) to save it from the [Embalmed Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler). Though Fujita managed to stop the [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) with [Patron of the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild), Tanaka had been growing an airforce, and Fujita was soon facing doom on too many fronts. He scooped rather than wait for the end.

**Final Result:** Hisaya Tanaka defeats Osamu Fujita 2-1
