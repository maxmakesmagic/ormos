![Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Roar+of+the+Wurm)Both Nicolai Herzog and Antoine Ruel are experienced Pro players with many years of experience. Herzog is a former European Champion from back in 1999. Antoine Ruel made the Semi-finals at the 2001 World Championships.Ruel is running Zombies while Herzog is playing blue-green Madness.

### Game 1

Ruel won the die roll and elected to go first. The first action came on the second turn when Ruel [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed Herzog's [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). Herzog used his madness outlet to put a Rootwalla into play and drop two [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar)s into the graveyard before it died itself.

"[Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch)," Ruel asked of his deck.

Instead he summoned [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator). The next turn Herzog countered a [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) with [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Both players then ran into land problems, being unable to find a 4th. They raced for a while: Herzog with a 'Walla, Ruel with the Rotlung.

Herzog was first to find his fourth and it was more critical as he could then start cranking out the [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar)s from the graveyard. Ruel was still stuck on three land. He chumped with the Rotlung, then the zombie token, before finally naming [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) with [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to admit defeat.

Herzog 1-0 Ruel

Herzog spent some time sideboarding, admitting he hadn't really tested this matchup.

### Game 2

Ruel delayed a Therapy until turn 2, but there was no [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) in Herzog's hand for it to hit. The Norwegian summoned an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and Ruel matched it with a [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade). Herzog had the answer in [Stupefying Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch) in his hand, but he'd drawn a [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) instead and elected to go with that. Ruel got rid of the Touch with a second Therapy and dealt with the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) with a [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother).

![Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Smother)[Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) and [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) on the Shade later and Herzog had the advantage with just his [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). He pressed this home by flashing back a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). This found another [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) but Ruel was able to restore parity by wiping the board with a [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate).He followed up with [Shambling Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm) to take the initiative with a [Shambling Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm).

Herzog hit the reset button with an [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) but then his blue-green deck reared its unpredictable side. After [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ing a Rootwalla, Ruel [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed Herzog and the Norwegian showed him a grip full of land.

The [Shambling Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm) returned, was followed by a [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) and it was time for a decider.

"That was a lot of lands to draw"

Herzog 1-1 Ruel

### Game 3

Ruel mulliganed and a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took an [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), revealing Herzog had a hand full of fat: 2 [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) and an [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). It got a lot faster for the Norwegian. He shut down Ruel's Shade with a [Stupefying Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch) and then dropped a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel).

Ruel topped it with an Edict, but it didn't get much better for the Frenchman. Herzog followed [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) with [Compost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compost) and an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). Ruel tried to keep pace. He [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed the [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), and brought out [Shambling Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm) and then [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse).

Meanwhile Herzog had added a second Baloth and was battering. This forced Ruel into a horrible trade where he had to put Shade and Swarm in the way of the beasts. Herzog put damage on stack then sacrificed the two Baloths for 8 life. With no creatures on Herzog's side Ruel was obliged to kill his own [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse) when the Swarm hit the graveyard. As Herzog was also drawing 3 cards off [Compost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compost) it was safe to say Ruel wasn't coming back from this one.

**Final Result:** Nicolai Herzog beat Antoine Ruel 2-1
