Gen Con 2011 is going to be held August 4-7, 2011 in Indianapolis, IN. And a lot of **Magic** is going to go on inside Gen Con. Let's take a look!

### Public Events

There will be booster drafts of ***Magic** 2012* or *Scars of Mirrodin* Block available at all times starting at 9:00 AM Thursday. In addition, there will be "Win-A-Box" tournaments in Standard, Legacy, and Vintage. They're called that because the prize for winning is a box of 36 booster packs of ***Magic** 2012*!

There are other **Magic** events going constantly throughout Gen Con. A quick look at [the Gen Con Public Event schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/gencon2012) will answer all questions!

### Championships! Championships! Championships!

That's three championships, right? Friday has the [Vintage Championships](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/vintagechamps) and Saturday has the [Legacy Championship](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/legacychamps), and the whole weekend has the 2011 [US National Championships](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/nationals/unitedstates)!

And that doesn't even include the 2011 Block Championship! Or the 2011 Midwest Masters Series Championship! Or all the Mini-Master tournaments! Or the Grand Melee! Look, maybe you should just look at the schedule, because there's a lot there.
