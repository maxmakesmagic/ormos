**Name:** Takamasa Fukata  
**Age:** 20  
**Residence:** Kobe (southern region of Japan)


**How did you start playing Magic?**


I saw an ad for Magic in Hobby Japan magazine (an Inquest style gaming magazine). It looked interesting, so I purchased an English language 4th Edition Starter and learned the rules. I used a dictionary to translate the English cards. I've now been playing for 5 years



**Have you played in any other big Tournaments?**


I played in Grand Prix-Kyoto, Grand Prix-Nagoya and 2000 Japanese Nationals. I placed 22nd at 2000 Japanese Nationals.



**What do you do outside of Magic?**


I play arcade games, especially fighting games like Street Fighter.



**How do other Magic players react to you being a priest?**


My opponents are often fearful and intimidated of me. Thankfully there is nothing that says you can't play games in the Buddhist religion.



**So how did you decide to become a Priest?**


My uncle is a priest and he asked me if I would like to become a priest. I said yes and started going to a Buddhist university. It takes 4 years at the university before I graduate and become a full priest.



**What is your favourite Magic set?**


Mirage is my favorite set because it has lots of big creatures. My favorite card is Sneak Attack.



**How do you expect to perform in Grand Prix Sapporo?**


I'm fairly confident for tomorrow and I plan to finish in the money. I like constructed Magic more and generally don't do as well in limited events. Unfortunately, being a priest does not give me time to practice my limited skills.
