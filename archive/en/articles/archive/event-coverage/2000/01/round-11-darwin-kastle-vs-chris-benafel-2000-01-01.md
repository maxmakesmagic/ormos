Darwin is hoping to break Benafel's streak against him, and make top 8, but Benafel is certainly in contention as well. A little banter goes back and forth before the match, deciding who is actually the slower player, and the consensus seems to be Benafel. Darwin is packing 3 sporty draws from his control deck getting timed out, while Benafel has a pair of losses.


Benafel is with the Solution, a mix of quick blue and white creatures to land early tempo and defend them with counter magic. Kastle is playing a slow, but effective URB Control deck with a lot of answers to early creature drops. He also has access to more counter magic and card advantage than Benafel, so if he can stall out the game, he should be able to take it. 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPDEN01/153fm11kastlebenafel.jpg)Benafel starts off fast with a [Stormscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Apprentice) and [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight), but Kastle Fires up the weenie, and [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)s up some more answers. Still the knight is a pain as most of Kastle's removal is red (Fire/Ice, [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage) etc), but he does have [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil), [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void) and Spite/Malice in his deck to deal with the Knight, despite taking many early beats from it he calmly [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)s again, gaining more and more counter magic. It should be noted that Benafel beat "Baby Huey" earlier in the tourney using the same tactic, giving his opponent unbelievably juicy card piles, so long as they get very little to control the board with. (He had made a previous split with Jensen that had 2x [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb) and [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude) over a Tapper and [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx)). While the hard working [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight) keeps plugging away at Kastle's life total, Kastle fires off a third [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), this time netting him his 4th FoF and a land. Benafel's attempts at adding to his bare knight are constantly countered by Kastle, but he simply cannot seem to find a way to get rid of the knight. Since Kastle's deck has absolutely no creatures (not even a Crosis as a finisher) it allows him to make Benafel's [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)'s easy 4-1 splits, the threat or the creature removal and lands. A surprise [Tsabo's Decree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Decree) by Kastle sweeps out the knight (with him at 7) and reveals a hand full of useless [Respulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Respulse)s in Benafel's. From there on in, it was just a matter of time and card advantage. While Kastle built up the mana to Rage Benafel out of the game. 


Kastle 1-0 Benafel


Heading into round 2 with 22 minutes on the clock (time management is a real buzzword among these two), Benafel looked to be digging heavily into his sideboard (probably tearing out the worthless [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)s and the very so-so [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)s) for [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay) and more action cards, perhaps even [Unnatural Selection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unnatural+Selection) to get around those brutal [Tsabo's Decrees](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Decrees). Kastle seemed confident and did not seem to make too many changes. Benafel seemed intent on getting Kastle to hurry, but Darwin progressed at a normal pace, no faster, but no slower either.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPDEN01/155fm11kastle.jpg)Playing first, again Benafel busted out with the [Stormscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Apprentice), but had no drops to back it up on turn 2 or 3. This suits Kastle to a T, since he now has counter magic up and running, and faces very little pressure in the form of a single 1/1. A turn 5 Lynx hits the table for Benafel with some help from [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), but this gives Kastle a window to Fire up both and sweep his board. An FoF during the next end step is pure gas with 2x [Tsabo's Decree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Decree), [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void), [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude) and [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) (it nets Kastle a pair of Decree's and [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)). Interestingly, when Kastle "Decrees" on Wizards (nailing a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage)) it reveals Benafel's hand of [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) and [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude), which will still be bad against Kastle's total lack of creatures, or so we thought! Turns out that Kastle did bring in creatures, [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem)s. After a Void for 3 by Kastle, sweeping out all of the counters and bounce, he landed the 4/5 artifact monster, totally halting Benafel's ground forces (which only consisted of a single Galina's Knight anyway). Another 3/4 Golem hits the table a couple of turns later, and the works are totally gummed up for Benafel. As if that was not enough, another FoF later and a THIRD colorless Golem hits the board, and Kastle is swinging for the fences, rolling over Benafel completely and forcing a concession. 


Kastle 2-0 Benafel
