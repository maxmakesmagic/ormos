![Reverence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reverence)**[Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverence)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. The art for [Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverence) shows the daimyo [Konda, Lord of Eiganjo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Konda%252C%2BLord%2Bof%2BEiganjo) inside the [Eiganjo Castle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Eiganjo%2BCastle) throne room. The people around him are suffused with reverence and awe for him, presumably because he can have them executed at a whim.
 ![Mulch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mulch)**[Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch)** – *Stronghold* common. [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch) nearly got reprinted in *Odyssey*, but it (and [Song of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Song+of+Blood)) proved to be way too good at achieving threshold. Not bad for a card that essentially means "shredded vegetables"!
 ![Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Opposition)**[Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition)** – *Urza's Destiny* rare. [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) represents a duel of pure magic between Barrin and Urza. But when it took the tournament world by storm, it was combined with the cheerful goofiness of [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) or the weirdness of [Saproling Cluster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling+Cluster). The moral: even powerful wizards like having pets!.
 ![Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fire)**[Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Fire)** – *Apocalypse* uncommon. When the original split cards were proposed for *Invasion*, Mark Rosewater and Bill Rose had to fight the developers to get them into the set. By the time *Apocalypse* hit the streets, everybody was firmly onboard!
 ![Caltrops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=caltrops)**[Caltrops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caltrops)** – *Urza's Destiny* uncommon. In the days of *Urza's Block* Limited, [Caltrops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caltrops) plus [Angelic Curator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Curator) was a fine combo. It never really made it in *Urza's Block* Constructed, possibly because of the presence of cards like [Time Spiral](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Spiral) and [Tolarian Academy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Academy).
 ![Gleemax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gleemax)**[Gleemax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleemax)** – *Unhinged* rare. We've told this story before, but the idea behind [Gleemax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleemax) is that it's the giant brain that controls R&D. Of course, it's totally fictional and nothing to worry about. GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, HUMAN.![Kindle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kindle)**[Kindle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kindle)** – *Tempest* common. The original template for [Kindle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kindle) referred to "Kindle cards," but it was later changed to "cards named Kindle." The original template seems to imply the existence of a "Kindle" type, which is not what was intended.
 ![AWOL](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=AWOL)**[AWOL](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AWOL)** – *Unhinged* common. Ever wish you could get a better look at the milk carton in the text box? Check out [this feature article](/en/articles/archive/behind-scenes-unhinged-2004-11-29), which shows jokes so small and obscure even Mark Rosewater didn't know they were there!
 ![Frost Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frost+Ogre)**[Frost Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Ogre)** – *Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. In Kamigawa, red cards were associated with snow and ice, resulting in cards like [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) and [Frost Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Ogre). In most sets, these cards would probably have had a fire-related name, but after all, mountains *are* usually snow-capped!
 ![Reverse the Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reverse+the+Sands)**[Reverse the Sands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverse+the+Sands)** – *Champions of Kamigawa* rare. In the art for [Reverse the Sands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverse+the+Sands) life totals are represented as age; the figure in the background has stolen the youth of the character in front. Neat, huh?
 ![Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forest)**[Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)** – *Shards of Alara* basic land. Through *Fifth Edition*, basic lands had the rules text (for example) "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) to your mana pool." The "single giant ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)" first appeared in *Portal*, but it didn't make it onto "regular" **Magic** cards until *Sixth Edition*.
 ![Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mountain)**[Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)** – *Arabian Nights* basic land. Because it was the only basic land included in the *Arabian Nights* set (due to a strange set of circumstances), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) is the most-printed card in **Magic**.
 ![Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)**[Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)** – *Shards of Alara* basic land. You might think the most [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)-centric Limited format was *Odyssey-Odyssey-Torment*, but it was really triple *Urza's Saga*. Having both [Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) and [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) at common meant that it was not unusual for an eight-person table to have multiple mono-black drafters. 
 ![Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Island)**[Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)** – *Shards of Alara* basic land. On pages 12-13 of Duelist #10 (April-May 1996), Chris Page wrote a two-page article about how the Duelists' Convocation (now the DCI) was going to ban Islands. This was just an April Fool's joke, but it caused confusion for years to come.
 ![Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Plains)**[Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)** – *Shards of Alara* basic land. Although historically hardly any cards have the ability to plainswalk, there are [Great Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Great%2BWall) [Lord Magnus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lord%2BMagnus) that were created explicitly to block them. Sorry, [Zodiac Rooster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Rooster)!
 ![Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Birds+of+Paradise)**[Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise)** – *Alpha* rare. The art on the Alpha [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) was originally commissioned for [Tropical Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island), but the bird was so prominent that art direct Jesper Myrfors swapped the art onto a creature.
 ![Esper Cormorants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Esper+Cormorants)**[Esper Cormorants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Cormorants)** – *Conflux* common. The flavor text for [Esper Cormorants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Cormorants) shows one of the ways in which the ways of Esper are strange to the people of Bant. Earth-bound cormorants are widely varied, with (according to Wikipedia), at least 40 types.
 ![Soraya the Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soraya+the+Falconer)**[Soraya the Falconer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soraya+the+Falconer)** – *Homelands* rare. When it was first printed in 1995, [Soraya the Falconer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soraya+the+Falconer) could only work with Falcons. But with the advent of the Great Creature Type Update, she can give banding to any bird in **Magic**. Clearly, the falconer spent the years since 1995 learning new skills.
 ![Jeweled Bird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jeweled+Bird)**[Jeweled Bird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeweled+Bird)** – *Arabian Nights* uncommon. Although it's banned in all sanctioned formats (as are all ante cards), [Jeweled Bird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeweled+Bird) was the key card in Kai Budde's win over Dan Clegg at the [2001 **Magic** Invitational](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2001-magic-invitational-2015-09-02). So you have it to thank for the existence of [Voidmage Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voidmage+Prodigy)!
 ![Dovescape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dovescape)**[Dovescape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape)** – *Dissension* rare. Amaze your friends! If you control both [Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile) and [Dovescape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape) in play, any noncreature spell you play can instantly turn into an arbitrarily large number of doves. It's like you're a stage magician and a planeswalker *all at the same time*!
