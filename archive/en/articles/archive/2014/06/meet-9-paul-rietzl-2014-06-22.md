It almost seems unfathomable that Paul Rietzl has been playing the game for as long as he has. It seems like only yesterday that Little Darwin was tearing it up at events on the East Coast, shilling people for Drafts between the rounds of the Pro Tour.



 "I've been playing *Magic* since...*The Dark*, I think? But I've been playing competitively for like twelve years," he explained. "So I guess I've been playing *Magic* since about 1994. I'm 28, so I've been playing since I was 8 years old."



Like most players getting into the game, Rietzl's first brush with the game came when someone he knew introduced him to it. In his case, it wasn't a friend, just someone looking to have a little fun...and for an easy mark.



 "I immediately enjoyed the game," he began with a smile. "My babysitter taught me how to play. We played for ante, of course, even though he was 14 and I was 8. He would always beat me and take all of my best cards, like my [Drudge Skeletons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons) and my [Craw Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm) and my [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring)... he took everything. He hustled me pretty good."




 For many people, playing a game with an older kid, having him beat you repeatedly, and losing all of your sweet stuff might have really turned them off to the game. I wouldn't be surprised if more than one potential *Magic* player met an untimely demise in a similar situation. But Rietzl saw things differently. He began to see the strategy of the game, and, as he did, his interest in it really grew.
