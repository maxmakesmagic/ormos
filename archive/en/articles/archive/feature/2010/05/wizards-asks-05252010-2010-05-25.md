*What's your favorite planeswalker card?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennethnagle.jpg)**Ken Nagle:** My favorite planeswalker card is [Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar). One of the original planeswalker cycle printed in *Lorwyn* then again in ***Magic** 2010*, Chandra's original version is all about burning stuff to the ground. The card itself is fun, fair, and flavorful (we measure planeswalker cards by the "Three F's" Rule). I'm a fan of "Big Red"-style decks (a.k.a. "slow" red), where its burn focuses on board control until the expensive spells bad clean up. I put [Chain Reaction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Reaction), [Comet Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Comet+Storm), and more in *Worldwake* to support slower red decks.

Erik Lauer and I were the design/development team for *Duel Decks: Jace vs Chandra*, and I sure played a lot of the Chandra side!
