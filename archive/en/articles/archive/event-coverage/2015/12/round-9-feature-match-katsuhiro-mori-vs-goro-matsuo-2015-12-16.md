Katsuhiro Mori was the highest ranked APAC player this year and was invited to the invitationals in Sydney. Unfortunately he had to turn down the invitation because he has already missed too much school to play Magic and wouldn't get all his credits to graduate. Mori was playing Pande Burst and was matched up against Goro Matsu, one of Japan's top Constructed players, who played Survival. With two of Japan's finest, it promised to be a good match.

Game 1


Goro went first and had Survival of the Fittest in play turn two. He continued to get two Granger Guildmages, two Quirion Rangers and a Merfolk Looter into play. As Goro was setting up his combo Mori sat back playing Brainstorm, Merchant Scroll and Intuition to get his combo in order. Turn six saw the end of the game. Mori played Replenish and Force of Willed Goro's Counterspell. Goro then used the Merfolk Looter's ability to look for help but found none coming and conceded the game.
