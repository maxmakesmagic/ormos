Earlier this year, the Sydney Magic community lost one of its most beloved and long standing players, the Mighty Allan Sharpe.


Allan was known for both his love of the Red cards, and his willingness to help new players. It's been said that if there was a Magic tournament held in Sydney, Allan would be there. However, it was travelling further afield that proved difficult for him. Allan was plagued with a degenerative respiratory disease, and ended up dependent on a portable oxygen machine to help him breathe.


Despite being unable to be a part of the Sydney Magic Community's biannual road trips to Canberra for the National Championships and CanCon, Allan competed at Regionals every year without fail, because hey, it was a tournament and it was in Sydney! Why wouldn't he?


Inspired by his determination, several members of Sydney's Magic community managed to convince Allan, oxygen machine in tow, to make the trips to Nationals in 2009. He may not have made it through the Last Chance Qualifiers, but everyone there agreed Allan had a great time playing in the Public Events that weekend.


Unfortunately, as Allan's health continued to decline over the last few years, his tournament attendance also lessened. That didn't dull Allan's love of gaming or Magic, though. When Allan could no longer make it out to the games, the world of online gaming (including Magic: Online!) brought the games to him.


While Magic in Australia will miss the Mighty Allan Sharpe, it will forever be better because of him.
