![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPFLO00/140.jpg)Mattias Jorstedt is a solid player from Sweden. He won this year's Nordic Championship, made top 16 at 2000 GP Manchester, and came fifth at the 1999 European Championship. Jorstedt thinks that Trix is the best deck right now, and since he "always plays the best deck," he's playing Trix this weekend. 



From France is the opposition, Antoine Ruel. Ruel has an impressive history in team events with a first place at 2000 GP Porto, another win at 1999 Team GP Cannes, yet another win at 1999 Team Invitational in New York, and sixth at this year's Team PT New York. You may be thinking that Porto wasn't a team event. You're right; however, he sat beside his brother in the Top 8 draft and it looked a lot like a team draft. Ruel hasn't tested for today's event and was given his PandeBurst deck by fellow Frenchman Alexis Dumay.



**Game 1**


Jorstedt won the first game quite quickly. He cast Necropotence third turn to which Ruel Intuitioned in response. Jorstedt went on to cast Illusions of Grandeur. When the ability was on the stack, Ruel Pyroblasted it. Jorstedt Misdirected the Pyroblast on to the Misdirection itself and with no solution Ruel conceded.



**Game 2**


Unfortunately for Jorstedt, he lost three Negator Storms and two Illusions of Grandeur the first time he Demonic Consultationed. Ruel revealed his "tech" with a turn four DanDan. The DanDan then got through for a lot of damage. However, when Illusions of Grandeur is cast the damage isn't quite as relevant. Jorstedt didn't have Necropotence in play and when his Donate was Force of Willed it meant that he would have to draw another. Even if he did draw it, he knew that it would be Force of Willed. So, instead of playing out the defeat, he conceded.



**Game 3**


Game three started off as could be expected. The turning point was when Jorstedt cast Illusions of Grandeur that was Force of Willed that in response he Force of Willed. The problem with this was that Jorstedt had to discard his only blue card with it. That card happened to be his last Donate. With no chance to win Jorstedt decided to then offer his hand to Ruel, giving him the opportunity to concede. Ruel looked quite puzzled and decided to play on. Jorstedt conceded the next turn. 



**Final Result:** Antoine Ruel wins, 2-1
