By Mike Turian




Before joining Magic Online as its digital product manager, Mike worked as a producer for Wizards's technology department, a product manager for organized play, and as an R&D lead developer. He has played Magic Online since it came out in 2002 and Magic since The Dark. 






![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptla05/s_mcdanielmoreno2.jpg)The stage was set for one of these newcomers to make the finals.Billy Moreno sent back his first hand and said, "Two [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), no creatures." Chris responded with a grin and a wry "sounds like a keeper." Billy's second hand was little better, having all blue spells and a single [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest).


Billy played a Blue-green splash black Madness deck. The deck relied on quick creature damage from [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), all the while trying to use its permission to keep his opponent on his back foot.


Billy kept his hand on the third try and played a first-turn [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study). Billy discarded a [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) into play and a Jitte into the graveyard while Chris only played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Chris accelerated with a [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) to fetch a second [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).


Billy hit for three the turn before by pumping his [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla). A second [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) saw Billy discarded [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) and another Jitte. When Billy went to play out a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), Chris took advantage and resolved a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), and [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) were the option. Billy gave Chris the [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) and the [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams).


Another [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) let Billy hit Chris for four. After combat he played down another [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel).


Chris played a [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), the piles were split [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) or double [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) and a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Chris took the Heartbeat pile.



![basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Basking+Rootwalla)

It was time for Chris to go off. He started the turn with a [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) followed by an [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest). Chris tried to [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) but Chris has another [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest). Now he had close to 20 mana floating, it was all about building up his storm count. He cast another [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). Billy had no cards in hand and was just along for the ride, splitting [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)s. There was no stopping Chris as an early [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) revealed a [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), which wrapped up the game.


Chris 1, Billy 0


As they were sideboarding Chris said, "My sideboard is useless between games, it's only any good during the game."


### Game 2


Billy was on the play, but it was Chris who mulliganned to start Game 2. The mulligan would be especially painful because of the extra discard from [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) that Billy brought in after sideboarding.


Billy started with a [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave) and then a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study). He pitched a [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) and a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) to get the game off to a strong start. A second turn [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) continued the pressure while Chris had nothing but lands. Billy flashbacked a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and hit for four pitching a second Analysis. When Chris went for a [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), Billy had a [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) waiting. On his own turn Billy swung in for five as he pumped a [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). After combat he played a second [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptla05/s_mcdaniel.jpg)*McDaniel took an early two-game lead.*
Chris only played a land on his turn. The two [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel)s and a [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) swung in for five. Billy resolved a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) during his own main phase pulling a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and [Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) from his deck. Chris decided to give the [Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life) from the Loa and [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla).


Billy sacrificed [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) to [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). Chris had no response, sitting with all four lands untapped. Billy named [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), it hit. Chris still had a [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) remaining.


Chris uses the [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) to reveal three lands, [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), and [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest). Billy splits the two spells and placed two lands with the [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest). Chris decided to take the pile with [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring).


During Billy's next upkeep Chris played [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to keep himself alive. Billy had no counter. He dredged back [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) with his draw and then cast the same Loam to bring back a [Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum). He played and cracked the Coliseum for two cards and the [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) but couldn't find a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). Even when he used a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) to see more cards he couldn't find a Therapy. He had to pass the turn.



![circular logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Circular+Logic)

Now was Chris's best chance because Billy didn't have up mana for [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). All of his digging had left him with only a 26-card library even a small [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) could finish of Billy. Chris started off with a [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) and followed with a [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) for two bringing back [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest). The last card in his hand was the [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) and he cast it to reveal Minds Desire, [Revive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revive), [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams). Billy decided to give Chris a [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) and a [Revive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revive).


The [Revive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revive) brought back an [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) that allowed Chris to cast a [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) for eight cards. One of the eight was a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to fetch the [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) and deck Billy.


Chris 2, Billy 0


### Game 3


Billy started the third game with his back to the wall. He would need to win three straight games to advance to the finals. Things didn't get better as he needed to mulligan his hand down to six.


He started with a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) and passed the turn. Chris laid down an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). On turn two Billy made a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and Chris played [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). The Elder went for a land after it got in the way of a [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). Billy played down a second [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) to turn up the pressure.



![Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Mongrel)

Chris tried to resolve a [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) but Billy had a [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) waiting. On Billy's turn he attacked for four and played a third [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). Chris tried to resolve a new [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) but Billy had a new [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) to stop that Heartbeat as well. The three [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel)s went in again only to meet [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). Billy refilled his hand by pitching and flashing back a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).


The next time the [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel)s tried they successfully got through for damage. Chris used his mana to play a [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). After searching his library he pulled out [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams), [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). He needed more cards after having both of his Heartbeats stopped cold.


Billy decided to give Chris [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Chris untapped and played a [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) for two trying to bring back [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). One of the cards discarded to the Dreams was a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).


Billy's [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel)s went over again but a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) stopped their progress. Chris played his third [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring). This one finally resolved. He stopped for a minute to do some math. Billy decided to cast a [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). The spell flipped up [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams), [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and Fact of Fiction.



![Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Naturalize)

Billy split the piles 4-1. He offered a new [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) or the other four cards. Chris had only one [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) available and decided to take the larger pile. He played a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and cast an [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest). Billy not only countered the [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) but also [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)d the [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring). Chris was visibly upset. This whole game, he had been stopped every time he had just started to get going. His last futile attempt was to flashback a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) but that offered no help as the [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel)s finished the job.


Chris 2, Billy 1


### Game 4


Chris played a land while Billy started again with a turn-one Careful study into [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). Chris didn't have a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) or a [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and just passed his second turn. Billy, meanwhile, went for a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) naming [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring). Chris discarded his one [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) and showed a hand of two lands, two [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and a [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams). Chris just played a land and passed the turn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptla05/s_mcdanielmoreno.jpg)*McDaniel and Moreno battled long into the day.*
Billy cast a second [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). Chris responded with a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). Billy took a [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams). Chris had drawn a [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze).


On Billy's following turn the [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) knocked Chris to 15. Chris played [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) during the end step to go retrieve a [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Billy hit with the [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) but this time pumped it up to 3 power. The previously mentioned [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) ran into a [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) but at least it let Chris resolve [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder).


The [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) slammed into the [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). Chris now had seven lands in play.


On his own turn Chris flashed back the [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), going down to 9. Billy sent in [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) as a 3/3 but Chris used a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to stop the damage. Billy played a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) to bring a new [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) into play. Even with two Cabal Therapies in his graveyard, Billy didn't appear to even consider them before passing the turn.


Chris only cast a [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth). He needed to find business spells before it was too late. Billy sent in for four damage but Chris used [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to stop the damage. Chris used a flashback spell of his own, [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and named [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). Chris revealed his hand to be [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).



![Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cephalid+Coliseum)

Chris continued dropping out land while Billy sent in the [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) for five. That was enough damage to convince Chris to use a new [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). Chris played a land; during the end step Billy used a [Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) to bring down an [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm).


During Billy's upkeep Chris tried to [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) that was countered by [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Chris had no choice but to [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) himself to find another [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). In the 9 cards he did find one, and cast it to buy himself one more turn.


Chris played a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) trying to hold on for as long as possible. Billy sent his men into the Red Zone and put Chris at four. Chris sacrificed [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) to [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). Chris's hand was only a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest).


Chris draw didn't help enough, another [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) met his [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), and they were onto the deciding Game 5.

### Game 5


Chris led with an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Once again Chris failed to make a turn two mana acceleration play. Billy played a turn two [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) off of a [Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) and discarded [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Then he cast a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and named [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). Once again the Therapy was on target. Chris revealed a land, two Minds Desires, [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring). Chris played the Heartbeat on the following turn.


Tapping all three of his lands, Billy played a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). He started to pass the turn but realized he had three mana in his pool and cast a [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize). Chris untapped and played a new [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptla05/s_moreno.jpg)*Moreno recovered from a miscount of mana to reach Threshold.*
Billy then played an [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) and a [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla). The [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) came in for damage and Billy used the [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) from his graveyard to take out Chris's [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction).


Chris played a [Nostalgic Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nostalgic+Dreams) to bring back [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and cast it. On Billy's turn Billy used a [Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) without having Threshold. At this point, Head Judge Gijsbert Hoogendijk was called in.


Luckily for Billy, his hand was on camera and escaped with just a warning. After the situation was corrected Billy managed to get Threshold discarding an [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) to the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and by using a fetchland.


After that he decided to blow his Coliseum and attack with a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). Billy sent his whole hand into the Tog and dealt lethal damage to finish an amazing comeback and advance to the finals.


Final Score: Billy Moreno 3, Chris McDaniel 2
