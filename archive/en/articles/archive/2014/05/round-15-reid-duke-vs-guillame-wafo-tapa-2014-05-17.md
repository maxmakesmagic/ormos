 With only two rounds left to play, No. 2 Ranked Player Reid Duke and Guillame Wafo-Tapa have a great deal on the line for this match. Sitting at 11-3, the winner will likely secure themselves the ability to safely draw into the Top 8 in the final round, while the loser will need to win the next round and then rely on fate to see if their tiebreakers carry them to the last one or two spots of the Top 8.




 Sitting in second place in the Player of the Year standings, Reid Duke has the ability to leapfrog current Player of the Year frontrunner Jeremy Dezani with a Top 8, giving himself at least a three-point lead going into the home stretch of the season. As it stands, he sits with a four-point lead in the North American region over teammate and good friend Owen Turtenwald. Turtenwald is on course for a likely Top 50 finish, so he would keep the gap from widening too much, but Duke would still command a nearly twenty-point lead with merely a Quarterfinals finish. In addition to locking up the World Championship spot, Duke would secure himself the captaincy on his very first US National team for the World **Magic** Cup.




 Wafo-Tapa, on the other hand, needs the Top 8 finish to lock up Platinum status for next season. The taciturn French deck-builder is up against tall odds to secure himself a spot in the World Championship or World **Magic** Cup, as Jeremy Dezani appears to have a vice grip on those positions at the moment. Still, with the points he would earn from a win, he would certainly vault high enough into the standings to be in the running for one of the at-large spots at the World Championships, so it's not out of the realm of possibility.






*No. 2 Ranked Player Reid Duke and Guillaume Wafo-Tapa needed a win in order to lock up a Top 8 this weekend. Who would secure their spot into Sunday with this match?*
