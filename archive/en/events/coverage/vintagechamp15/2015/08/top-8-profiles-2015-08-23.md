**What did you play today, and how did you do?**  

Hangarback Workshop. Great, obviously.


**Why did you choose your deck?**  

It’s an evolution of the deck I played to win the byes at the GenCon Vintage trial. It’s very good in the Workshop mirror.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**  

Mishra’s Workshop. It’s a [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) that doesn’t go away.


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**  
[Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter). It’s in there for the Workshop Mirror, and I played several of them.


**What is your favorite card in Vintage?**  
[Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault). I love a [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) deck, but today was not a great day for it.

**Hometown:** Philadelphia, PA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**

**What did you play today, and how did you do?**  
[Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), 8-1-1 (unintentional draw).


**Why did you choose your deck?**  

It’s the best fast combo deck that doesn’t lose to Workshop and also the only one I own.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**  
[Bazaar of Baghdad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad). It is the reason the deck exists. [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) because it just keeps happening and generating Zombies. [Petrified Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petrified+Field) because [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) is the most played non-blue land in the format.


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**  
[Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer) because it kills a thing and makes a Zombie. [Barbarian Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring) because it kills [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest), goes to the face and makes mana.


**What is your favorite card in Vintage?**  

Currently [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), the creature without haste that is somehow the fastest dude in the deck.

Jeskai Control, 8-1-1.

It looked good.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**  
[Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). It wins the game.


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**  
[Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle). It stops lots of random things.


**What is your favorite card in Vintage?**  
[Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall).

**What did you play today, and how did you do?**  

Delver. Made Top 8 at least apparently.


**Why did you choose your deck?**  

I’ve had a ton of experience with it over the past year and no one is gunning for it after [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) was restricted.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**  

One extra land. Played against Workshop all day.


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**  
[Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer). Loves eating things.

Midrange Mentor designed by Li Xu. The deck performed great. No complaints.


**Why did you choose your deck?**  

I feel it is well positioned and is a ton of fun to play.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**  
[Dack Fayden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dack+Fayden). It sigs, fueling delve and is great against Workshop decks.


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**  
[Pulverize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulverize) is insane. I faced four Workshop matchups.


**What is your favorite card in Vintage?**  
[Demonic Consultation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Consultation). Please unrestrict it.

**Age:** 34


**Hometown:** Norwood, MA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Two-time Watersbury Champion. SCG Power 9 winner. Former Rhode Island State Champion. Member of the Vintage community.


**What did you play today, and how did you do?**  

I played Ravager Workshop. I did well enough to be filling [a Top 8 profile] out.


**Why did you choose your deck?**  

Because Mishra’s Workshop is overly powerful. I wanted to play blue but felt that would be an irresponsible decision.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**  

Mishra’s Workshop. It’s an uncounterable three-for-one.


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**  

My [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) hate. because of the Zombie horde.


**What is your favorite card in Vintage?**  

Mind Slaver! Please unrestrict [Thirst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst) for Knowledge. Of course, [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) is pretty good too.

**Age:** 35


**Hometown:** Wilkes-Barre, PA


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Split first place at BMG’s Eternal Extravaganza. Had an entire Vintage archetype named after me.


**What did you play today, and how did you do?**  

Dragonlord Salvagers Oath. I did well.


**Why did you choose your deck?**  

It’s powerful and intricate, had personality, is not easily hated out and should be well positioned in a [Gush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gush)/Mishra’s Workshop metagame.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**  

Dragonord Dromoka. [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge). [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids).

Honorable mention to [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta): needs no elaboration.


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**  
[Magus of the Moat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moat). It shuts down so many attack angles so efficiently.


**What is your favorite card in Vintage?**  
[Library of Alexandria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria).
