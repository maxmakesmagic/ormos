The August 2008 [Friday Night Magic](http://archive.wizards.com/Link%20to:%20http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=events/magic/fnm) promo card is an alternate-art [Desert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desert). The art featured in this promo was illustrated by Glen Angus who passed away in July 2007. This piece of art was actually commissioned for the *Odyssey* set, but it got bumped during an eleventh hour frenzy of art swapping. 

Our story starts with this piece, which needed a home:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1643_Luminous_Guardian.Jpg)*Art by Terese Nielsen*

That art ended up on [Luminous Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminous+Guardian), which had the playtest name “Tireless Tribe”. 

![Luminous Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Luminous+Guardian)The art [Luminous Gaurdian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminous+Gaurdian) used to have got bumped to a card with playtest name “Scars of the Earth”.

As you may recognize, “Scars of the Earth” became the card [Need for Speed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Need+for+Speed). 

![Need for Speed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Need+for+Speed)Now the original art from [Need for Speed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Need+for+Speed) (“Scars of the Earth”) needed a home.

Eventually that art ended up on [Shadowblood Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowblood+Ridge), which had the playtest name “Moorlands”. 

![Shadowblood Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shadowblood+Ridge)The original art for “Moorlands” ended up getting bumped from the set.

But, thanks to the magic of promos, the displaced piece finally found the great home it deserved. Here’s how it all comes together on the [Friday Night Magic](http://archive.wizards.com/Link%20to:%20http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=events/magic/fnm) August promo:
