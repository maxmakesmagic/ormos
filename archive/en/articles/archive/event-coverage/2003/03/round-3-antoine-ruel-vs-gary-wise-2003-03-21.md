![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a949.jpg)This matchup is between two innovative and colorful decks. Antoine is playing a black/white Cleric deck that splashes blue for [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes) and features such nuttiness as [Celestial Gatekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Gatekeeper). Gary is playing a green-red-white fatty-filled [Biorhythm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) concoction with an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) in the sideboard to support three [Chromeshell Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromeshell+Crab)s.

### Game 1

Gary impressed me right off the bat by placing his [Forgotten Cave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Cave) in the graveyard when he cycled it, instead of in the center of the table "on the stack." The card goes to the graveyard as part of the cost to cycle it, not upon resolution of the draw effect, and putting it in the center of the table is, in a way, misrepresentation. Of course, when he cycled a [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) two turns later, he put it in the center of the table. Ah well. For the length of the match, Ruel also placed his cycling cards on the table instead of in the graveyard. Maybe the judges told players to do it that way to show what's going on, but I've heard whispers of players' cycling lands mysteriously ending up in play when the stack resolves. It's messy all over the tournament. I guess it's a personal problem I have, but I'm such a fan of technical play that little things like that bug me. Enough. There's a match to be played.

Antoine put out a turn-3 Rotlung Reaninator and a turn-4 [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse), giving himself some extra drawing power. But those paled before Gary's turn-5 Explosive-Vegetation-powered [Silvos, Rogue Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos%2C+Rogue+Elemental). Antoine took one hit from the monster and was dismayed when Gary added another six-mana green Legend—[Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa)—to the table.

Antoine had to play [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) on his next turn, even though Wise had a [Grand Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Coliseum) untapped and could regenerate [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos). Wise made the error of saying "Ok" and picking up his creatures before remembering to regenerate the Legend, however, and the judge ruled that it was too late. Antoine was back in the game.

Antoine played a [Celestial Gatekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Gatekeeper) with a [Starlit Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlit+Sanctum) untapped. If the Bird died, he could get back his Rotlung and a [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch) he discarded to an earlier [Read the Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes).

Wise played out a [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) and a [Wall of Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Mulch) and decided to bide his time. He had the [Biorhythm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) in hand and plenty of creature removal, and just needed to get Antoine to tap both of his Sanctums somehow.

Antoine played a morph which Gary hoped was an [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel), as Antoine had just four mana untapped. Gary [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ed the morph, hoping to get Antoine to tap out, but it was just a [Daru Sanctifier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Sanctifier). Gary was still in good shape, and cycled a pair of [Slice and Dice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice)s to knock out the Gatekeeper and the Sanctifier, untapped and cast [Biorhythm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm), dropping himself to 1 and Ruel to 2, and a [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) did the rest. 

"Who needs [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos)?"

Wise 1 – Ruel 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a948.jpg)Antoine got the jump in game 2 with a turn-3 [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator). Wise cycled a Tusker and dropped a turn-4 Baloth, which was felled by a [Death Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Pulse). Wise continued to develop his mana with Explosive Vegetaion, and then dropped Kamahl. He used the Legend's power immediately, turning Ruel's [Grand Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Coliseum) into a 1/1 and then [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ing it. If Wise was holding a [Slice and Dice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice) or a [Starstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm), all of Ruel's lands would be going away soon.

Ruel had put out an [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel), and had a [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) for the green Legend. He would win the damage race, but was still at the mercy of any of Gary's mass removal.

Wise made his second big error of the match, playing out a second Kamahl when one was already in play. With no removal in hand, the game was already bordering on the unwinnable for Wise, but the error was certainly demoralizing and got a rise out of the crowd. Wise shook his head. "That's from not knowing the cards very well." With no answers to the Angel forthcoming, Wise scooped. Kids at home: make sure you understand rule 420.5e.

Wise 1 – Ruel 1

### Game 3

Ruel started Game 3 under a Root Maze, playing three [Grand Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Coliseum)s and a [Barren Moor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Moor). Wise, on the other hand, had no such problems, using a fetchland, a Tusker, and an [Explosive Vegetation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation) to build the perfect mana. Antoine had answers for Gary's monsters, though: Kamahl was hit with [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival), and [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos) was Pacified. Antoine goaded Gary to play a second one. "I promise I won't do that," said the Canadian. [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) was also hit with a [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), and Wise was looking a little frustrated.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a950.jpg)Ruel put out some offense in the form of two [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator)s, which made Gary's mass removal all but worthless. [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) and [Celestial Gatekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Gatekeeper) complicated things even more for Wise. Gary made what looked to be a desperation "Fog" play with a [Starstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm) for two, which basically turned Antoine's Gatekeeper and two Reanimators into six tokens and... two Reanimators. But he was still alive. Ruel simply shrugged an played a face-down creature.

Wise had exactly what he needed, however—two more mass-removal spells. He played [Slice and Dice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice). Ruel flipped up his [Daru Sanctifier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Sanctifier) to give himself another Cleric, and winced when he realized that by doing so, he was forced to destroy the [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) on [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos) (the Pacified Baloth had long-ago been sacrificed for life). The Slice killed the Reanimators and gave Antoine a fresh batch of tokens. [Starstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm) for two took care of the tokens, and the [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel), leaving [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos) as the last man standing. Somehow Gary worked his way out of what looked like a hopeless situation.

Ruel, saddened, played another Gatekeeper and passed the turn. [Biorhythm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) and the trampling Elemental ended the match in Wise's favor.

**Final Result:** Wise 2 – Ruel 0

Wise was happy with the win, but disheartened with his shoddy play. "I play Online too much," he said, "Too much lazy mouse-clicking Magic. My board vision is terrible. I need to play more in real life." I guess there *can* be too much of a good thing.
