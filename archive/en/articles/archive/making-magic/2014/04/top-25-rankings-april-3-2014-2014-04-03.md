Well, that happened. Although what we said last week was true, the players who went Grand Prix gaming certainly made the most of it. While sixteen of the world's best **Magic Online** players were battling in San Francisco for the [**Magic Online** Championship](/en/events/coverage/dam-crowned-magic-online-champion) title—ultimately won by Lars Dam—the Grand Prix focus was on Beijing. Four of the Top 25 were ready to fight it out in Standard, and all four had solid weekends. One, however, turned solid into spectacular, and that man was Yuuya Watanabe. The former Player of the Year has now played in an astounding *twenty* Grand Prix Top 8s, and with his victory in Beijing he now has *seven* titles. There are few certainties in **Magic**, but Watanabe joining the ranks of the Hall of Fame is surely as close as it gets.


Watanabe wasn't the only ex-Player of the Year to reach the knockout rounds on Sunday. He was joined by fellow Japanese superstar Shuhei Nakamura, who rather ridiculously has even *more* GP Top 8s than Watanabe, clocking in at no fewer than *twenty-four*. Truly giants of the game, the pair of them.


Lee Shi Tian can be pleased with his 14th place in Beijing, quietly adding to his Pro Points for the season, and nudging him up to No. 15, while 2006 World Champion Makihito Mihara of Japan will be less pleased with his 67th place finish, leaving him just outside the points awarded to the Top 64, and seeing him slide to No. 17 in the rankings.


Now, after Watanabe's masterful reading of the Standard metagame, rocketing him eight places up the standings to No. 8, we switch to Phoenix this weekend for the latest chapter in the Standard story, and another chance for the likes of Reid Duke, Owen Turtenwald, and Ben Stark to close the gap on the No. 1 Jérémy Dezani of France. Join us again next week for another look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
