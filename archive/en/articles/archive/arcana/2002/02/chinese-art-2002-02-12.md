The Chinese government has strict control over the media in their country, and **Magic** card art is no exception. Along with overtly sexual or violent illustrations, human skeletons are not permitted on the cards.

In order to comply to these strict regulations, art often has to be completely redone, but in some cases the original can be altered enough to pass. As an example, here is the card [Charcoal Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charcoal+Diamond) from 7th Edition in its English version and its Simplified Chinese version.
