The May 6, 2016 Update
======================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 6, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by today being a weird day. We have [Jon Finkel interviewing Jon Finkel](#finkel) and [Shawn "The Hammer" Regnier](#hammer) resurfacing, among others.


Today's Must
============


1. [Ross VS. Majors: G/W Tokens VS. Grixis Control](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32873_Ross-VS-Majors-.html) | StarCityGames | Ross Merriam and Michael Majors

This one gets the "must" slot because Green-White Tokens seems to be all anyone is talking about, and Grixis Control is gaining a lot of momentum after being championed by Oliver Tiu to two great finishes at the Pro Tour and [Grand Prix Toronto](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gptor16). This might end up being one of the more popular matchups at [Grand Prix New York](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpny16) this weekend (or at your FNM), so pay attention.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [A Tale of Two Finkels](http://www.jonfinkel.com/a-tale-of-two-finkels/) | JonFinkel.com | Jon Finkel

Okay, you're probably confused just by the line above. I know I did a double take. But here's the story: Jon Finkel of JonFinkel.com is not our Jon Finkel. He doesn't play *Magic*. He's a sports writer. Apparently, their internet lives cross fairly often, often enough that Jon "Sports Writer" Finkel decided to reach out to Jonny *Magic* and write this very piece. It starts off talking about the confusion between the two, but ends up as a profile of the Hall of Fame *Magic* Pro (Hall of Famer is a bit confusing there too, because, as it happens, Sporty Finkel works for the College Football Hall of Fame).


I'm telling you. It's a weird day.


1. [Platinum Appearance Fees Make Pro *Magic* a Reality](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/platinum-appearance-fees-make-pro-magic-a-reality/) | ChannelFireball |Pascal Maynard

Pascal Maynard does some math and explains why he feels the Platinum appearance fees are necessary to promote pro *Magic*. He uses some actual numbers and some approximate ones to talk about the issue in real-world dollars, and what it means to different players.


1. [Rough Drafts: *Time Spiral*](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/rough-drafts-time-spiral) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

I'm considering just creating a SaffronOlive section in the update. It would probably save me time.


At any rate, he drafted a sweet *Time Spiral* deck in *Magic Online*'s Modern Flashback series, and if you have any sense of nostalgia, this is definitely the video for you.


1. [Episode 10: John's Seething Song #1 "The Reprint Problem"](http://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-h52q8-5f11a9#.VyyL_2Kj9gI.twitter) | Eyes on the Mise | John Wells and Ian Dixon

I really enjoyed this discussion of the issues surrounding reprints. Wells frames it as his "[Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song)"—and there is some seething going on—but it's actually a very measured response to some of the recent conversation on reprints. Definitely recommended if reprints are an issue that tickles your fancy.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> My ideal HoF - 250 pro points min for eligibility (currently 150). Each person gets 3 votes (not 5), needs 60% to get in (right now 40%)
> 
> 
>  — Paulo Vitor (@PVDDR) [May 5, 2016](https://twitter.com/PVDDR/status/728269295839547397)

Among a number of pros, this tweet kicked off a discussion on what the Hall of Fame should be. It's a discussion we're having internally as well (and planning to discuss with pros and Hall of Fame players alike), so seeing the reactions was certainly interesting. Follow the thread for opinions from Hall of Fame players and those who might be eligible one day.


1. > 
> [@Top8Games](https://twitter.com/Top8Games) 20 years ago today, The Hammer won PTLA
> 
> 
>  — Shawn Regnier (@ForwardFitness) [May 5, 2016](https://twitter.com/ForwardFitness/status/728262143259250688)

Wow, that was a blast from the past.


For those who don't know and aren't ancient like myself, Shawn "The Hammer" Regnier was one of the early stars of the pro circuit and a larger-than-life figure. I mean, obviously—his nickname was The Hammer, even then. He was one of the first players to Top 8 back-to-back Pro Tours. Coverage back then was slim, but you can see [the final standings here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptla96).


Where did The Hammer go after pro *Magic*? Well, apparently, given his Twitter feed, he's now a personal trainer. Which is absolutely perfect. Hats off to you, The Hammer. Happy 20 years.


Combined with the [Mike Long sighting](http://www.pe.com/articles/long-800958-car-magic.html) online a few weeks back, this makes me wonder if we're taking the marketing for *Eternal Masters* too far...

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Blue-Red Eldrazi](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2016-05-05)

And now for something new—a blue-red ramp deck!


*Magic Online* player EEEL piloted this deck to a 5-0 Competitive Standard League finish, relying on non-green ramp to get up to [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger), with a few other spicy meatballs along the way.


By utilizing [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods), [Hedron Archive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Archive), and the undervalued [Mage-Ring Network](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mage-Ring+Network), EEEL actually skips green altogether while working with the largest of Standard's Eldrazi, and, in doing so, makes some interesting choices.


[Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) is the real revelation here, offering both a form of board control and ramp up to Ulamog. With [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope), you can play the "blue" Eldazi on turn six and follow up with a [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods) to cast Ulamog on turn seven. If you throw a [Hedron Archive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Archive) in there, you can even speed it up by a turn.


But the cool part is that you don't need to. [Clash of Wills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Wills), [Spatial Contortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spatial+Contortion), and [Void Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Shatter) do an admirable job of holding down the fort, and [Jace, Unraveler of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Unraveler+of+Secrets) and [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) can dominate boards that are kept relatively clean. EEEL showed us that [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) isn't the end-all-be-all of ramp strategies—and neither is green.
