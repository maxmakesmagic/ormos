Sunday, 10:40a.m. – Drafting with Yuuya Watanabe
------------------------------------------------


*by Pip Hunn*

Winner of the last Australian Grand Prix, Player of the Year 2009, and general do-er of good, Yuuya Watanabe, sat down with a 7-0-1 record going into Day 2 of GP: Sydney. Watanabe had outlined a preference for drafting Blue/White, preferably with a few [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) s to smooth over any difficulties the opponents presented.


Pick one, pack one had a few options for the Japanese pro. He picked a [Necrogen Scudder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder) over some middling creatures. A [Trigon of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Corruption) , [Heavy Arbalest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heavy+Arbalest) and [Grafted Exoskeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Exoskeleton) all followed. With nothing coming in either black or blue, Watanabe picked an [Acid Web Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acid+Web+Spider) and a [Bellowing Tanglewurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Tanglewurm) . As the packs wheeled around, Watanabe found a [Ghalma's Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghalma%27s+Warden) and a [Scrapdiver Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapdiver+Serpent) . Pack one ended on a low note, with no bombs, removal or clear direction for Watanabe, with a smattering of Blue/White surrounding his playable Artifacts.


Pack two gave a little more early direction, with a [Darksteel Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Axe) followed by a [Kemba, Kha Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemba%2C+Kha+Regent) . [Revoke Existence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revoke+Existence) , [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) and [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) rounded out the first half of the pack, but once again Watanabe found himself forced to take middling picks earlier than he'd have liked. The second pack ended up with Watanabe in Blue/White, but still nothing spectacular about his deck.

Pack three failed to deliver the goods, with Watanabe forced to first-pick an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) as the only card he could justify running. An [Oxidda Scrapmelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Scrapmelter) and [Bloodshot Trainee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee) followed, helping justify the red splash to bolster Watanabe's deck with some much-needed power. A pair of [Sunspear Shikari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunspear+Shikari) and an [Neurok Invisimancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Neurok%2BInvisimancer), coupled with some Spellbombs, finished off Watanabe's draft. His draft pool was solidly Blue/White, but without any of the cards that can make the evasive archetype so powerful


Deck construction took Watanabe about three minutes. There were no close decisions to be made, no cards agonized over. He simply lined up the playable cards in his pool, confirmed he had a reasonable curve, and sighed as he began registering. His prediction?


"Maybe 1-2."

Feature Match Round 9: Max Botkov vs. Yuuya Watanabe
----------------------------------------------------


*by Pip Hunn*

Max Botkov is an undefeated player from New Zealand, who has made Top 8 New Zealand Nationals multiple times. He was two seats to the right of Yuuya Watanabe in the draft. Yuuya Watanabe is a seasoned ***Magic*** veteran. He won the last Grand Prix to be held in Australia, was Player of the Year in 2009, and has a string of Top 8's to his name. Both players are piloting Blue/White decks.


Game one highlighted the difference in power between the two decks. Botkov powered out a [Palladium Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palladium+Myr) , and then used his massive mana advantage to power out his end-game threats while Watanabe was still establishing himself. An unequipped [Sunspear Shikari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunspear+Shikari) does not race [Sky-Eel School](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sky-Eel+School) s very well.


**Max Botkov 1 - Yuuya Watanabe**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R9_Watanabe.jpg)*Yuuya Watanabe poses the question...*
Watanabe started game two in a stronger position, dropping a [Sunspear Shikari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunspear+Shikari) and then following it up with a [Grafted Exoskeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Exoskeleton) . Botkov found the perfect answer in [Glimmerpoint Stag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpoint+Stag) , killing the Shikari by unequipping the Exoskeleton. Watanabe tried again with his splashed [Bloodshot Trainee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee) , who he equipped and began dismantling Botkov's army. Watanabe followed up with a [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) . Botkov bounced the Exoskeleton back to Watanabe's hand with a [Disperse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse) , killing off the Trainee before it could dominate the board too much.


Watanabe used the [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) to good advantage, thinning through his deck and trying to answer the threats on the board. His [Darksteel Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Axe) was countered by a [Halt Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halt+Order) , leaving Watanabe's [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) s stranded in his hand. Botkov had a [Barbed Battlegear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Battlegear) for his [Darkslick Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Drake) , turning the 2/4 into a 6/3, which was a lot scarier for Watanabe. Watanabe used his [Trigon of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Corruption) to make sure he only took 5. Botkov passed, and Watanabe considered his options. His life total stood at 6, less than an ideal amount with a giant flier and deadly Equipment staring him down.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R9_Botkov.jpg)*...but is dismayed by Max Botkov's answer.*
Watanabe cast his [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) . Once it resolved, Watanabe responded to the trigger with another activation from his Trigon before returning it to his hand. He then followed up with an Invisimancer, attacking with an unblockable [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) . Botkov had drawn an awful lot of cards last turn off his [Culling Dais](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Culling+Dais) . When the Drake attacked, the [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) stood by and let the Drake knock Watanabe down to 2. Botkov cast a [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) , an uncounterable lethal burn spell as soon as he drew a mountain. Watanabe re-cast his [Grafted Exoskeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafted+Exoskeleton) and filtered through his cards with his [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) . He had enough mana to equip and swing with the Invisimancer, gaining some precious life back. But Botkov had another [Halt Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halt+Order) .


Watanabe casts a [Scrapdiver Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapdiver+Serpent) , his life total still dangerously low. Botkov summoned a [Vedalken Certarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Certarch) , hoping to play out one more artifact to be able to tap Watanabe down. He found it in [Palladium Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palladium+Myr) . Watanabe re-cast his [Trigon of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Corruption) , but left the Certarch alive even after it tapped down his Serpent. The Trigon was more important as an effective counter against Botkov's [Barbed Battlegear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Battlegear) ; both players thought through Botkov's next combat step very carefully.


Botkov attacked with his team, and Watanabe blocked, falling to one life and trading his [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) for the [Palladium Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palladium+Myr) . Post-combat, Botkov cast a [Razor Hippogriff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Hippogriff) and got his [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol) back from the graveyard. Watanabe couldn't find an answer to the incoming barrage of creatures, and conceded.


**Max Botkov 2 – Yuuya Watanabe 0**


 

Sunday, 11:32a.m. – The Artist in Residence
-------------------------------------------


*by Pip Hunn*

**Magic** artist Eric Deschamps is a genial fellow. Genial enough to put up with my bumbling attempts to make puns about his surname, and even graciously answer a few questions while scribing on the cards of his adoring fans. This isn't his first time in Australia. Deschamps has visited the sunny shores on more than one occasion. Coming over as a Graphic Designer for NBC during the Sydney 2000 Olympics, he survived the experience and enjoyed it enough to bring his wife back on honeymoon. Despite repeated visits to the country, the only thing that's tried to eat him has been a Box Jellyfish, which is quite a weak effort from the Australian wildlife.


Quite new to the **Magic** scene, Eric caught his first break in a funny enough way – his **Magic** artistic debut, and first professional job as an illustrator, was doing the artwork for Goblin S.W.A.T. Team for the [Unhinge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unhinge) d expansion. Eric met up with the then-Artistic Director at ComicCon and managed to snag the deal. A change in personnel at Wizards left Eric without contacts for a few sets, but he's gotten an increasing amount of work with the last few sets. Doing the artwork for flagship Standard cards like [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) and [Venser, the Sojourner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+the+Sojourner) is certainly helping to raise his profile.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R10_Artist.jpg)*Eric Deschamsterball. Err, I mean Deschamps.*
Deschamps works digitally outside his initial sketches, enjoying the control that he has over the process. I talked to some players in his signing queue, and apart from the powerful Planeswalkers, the hands-down favourite card of Deschamps was a surprise: not [Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage) , staple card in [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) decks the Extended world over, but [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) , a new Looter-effect card that promises broken things happening in the right deck. Despite having difficulty finding the time to sneak in games himself, Eric Deschamps is enjoying being welcomed into the community and looking forward to producing more cards for players in the future!


 

Feature Match Round 10 - Dominic Lo vs. The Jeremy Neeman
---------------------------------------------------------


*by Ray 'blisterguy' Walkinshaw*

The Jeremy Neeman has been a shining light in Australian **Magic** over the last year or so, making the Top 8 of Pro Tour San Juan earlier this year. His opponent in round 10 was none other than Grand Prix Auckland 2008 champion Dominic Lo.


Both players flooded the board with Myr in game one, but one of Neeman's was a [Myr Battlesphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Battlesphere) . Powerless to stop it, Lo was soon scooping up his cards in the hope game two would be kinder. It wasn't, and Neeman's Battlesphere took the match in two quick and merciless games.

Feature Match Round 11: Scott Richards vs. Brian Kibler
-------------------------------------------------------


*by Pip Hunn*

Richards began the game with a [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) on turn three. Kibler cast a [Necrogen Scudder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder) . Richards had a [Trigon of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Corruption) . After his Scudder attacked, Kibler summoned a [Moriok Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Reaver) . Kibler followed up with a [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) and a contagion Clasp, and shrunk the [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) . The Magnet tapped down the Myr and both creatures attacked, but Richards had a [Disperse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse) for the Scudder, making it painful for Kibler to re-play it later.


Richards attacked with his two creatures and then cast a [Carnifex Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnifex+Demon) . Kibler attacked with his Reaver, which the Demon let sail past. Kibler had his [Contagion Clasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp) ready; the Demon couldn't block for fear of being Proliferated to death. A [Kuldotha Forgemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Forgemaster) bolstered Kibler's board. Richards kept plugging away with his [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) , leaving his [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) home to guard. Kibler attacked with his Forgemaster and the Reaver. The [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) blocked the Reaver and pinged Kibler for 2. Kibler cast a [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) and passed. At the end of his turn, Richards cast a [Bonds of Quicksilver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonds+of+Quicksilver) on the Forgemaster and removed one of his [Carnifex Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnifex+Demon) 's counters, killing off the Reaver. Kibler Proliferated with his [Contagion Clasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp) and then used his [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) to tap down the Demon, and Richards had no other action.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R11_Richards.jpg)*New Zealand National Champ and Reigning Latin-American Championship Champ (no really!) Scott Richards.*
Kibler used his [Auriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica) to bounce the Demon and cast a [Bleak Coven Vampires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bleak+Coven+Vampires) . Richards used an [Instill Infection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instill+Infection) and one of his Trigon counters to kill the Vampires. Kibler re-cast his Scudder, leaving the life totals Kibler 7, Richards 4. Richards re-cast his Demon and passed. Kibler used the tempo to charge his [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) at the end of Richards' turn and tap down the Demon, letting the Scudder attack unblocked next turn. The Demon shrank it, leaving Richards on 2 life.


Richards had a [Darksteel Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Axe) but nothing else to play, and Kibler spent the 4 mana to keep the [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) going. The Demon used up its last counter to let drop the Scudder to a 1/1, and then Richards' Trigon killed off the Scudder. Richards cast a [Barbed Battlegear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Battlegear) , and Kibler started spending his mana to keep the Demon occupied, the with a single swing being lethal at this low life total. Kibler cast a [Leaden Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) and then another [Bleak Coven Vampires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bleak+Coven+Vampires) , hoping to end the game with the life swing. Richards had a [Disperse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse) in response, sending the [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) back to Kibler's hand. Kibler nodded and replayed the Magnet, Richards couldn't answer the Vampires in the turn he had, and both players reached for their sideboards for game two.


**Brian Kibler 1 – Scott Richards 0**


Kibler began with a [Nihil Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) and a [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) . Richards got defensive with a [Plated Seastrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Seastrider) , but Kibler's [Necrogen Scudder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder) laughed at the earthbound Strider. [Necrogen Scudder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder) was joined by a [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) from Kibler. The [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) attacked, but Kibler wasn't willing to give up either of his creatures yet. Kibler added to his board with a [Moriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Replica) , while Richards kept pace with a [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) . Kibler was unfazed, and swung in with the same two men as before. 5-point life swings gave Richards little time to find an answer. Kibler followed up with a [Mimic Vat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimic+Vat) , so Richards would need a very good answer indeed.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R11_Kibler.jpg)*2010 Hall of Fame inductee Brian Kibler comforts a lonely white die.*
Richard's effort turned out to be a [Flesh Allergy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+Allergy) . The [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) revealed itself to be a [Carnifex Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnifex+Demon) as Kibler sacrificed his [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) . Kibler cast a Grasp in [Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkness) on the [Carnifex Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnifex+Demon) , not realising that Richards could remove a counter from it in response, which he did. Kibler mistakenly thought the Demon was going to die, and put it under the [Mimic Vat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimic+Vat) . After Richards pointed out that the Demon was still alive, Kibler apologised, scooped the Grasp in [Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkness) back into his hand and began thinking. Several people hastened to remind Kibler that the Grasp in [Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkness) went to the graveyard on resolution.


"Minor details", Kibler grinned. He discarded the Grasp, untapped and attacked. Once the Demon had blocked his [Moriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Replica) , Kibler cast a second Grasp to kill the Demon, exiling it with the [Mimic Vat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimic+Vat) . Richards had nothing, and with Kibler reanimating Demons, the game finished in appropriately short order.


**Brian Kibler defeats Scott Richards 2 – 0**

Sunday, October 10: 2:18p.m. – The Judges
-----------------------------------------


*by Ray 'blisterguy' Walkinshaw*

Every event, the Australian judges pester me relentlessly to take their photo and put it in the coverage. There was this one time I took one, but ran out of time to put it up, and another time I didn't even take one. Man, they never let me forgot it. So without further ado, the wonderful judging staff for Grand Prix Sydney.

Sunday, 2:13p.m. – Drafting with Brian Kibler
---------------------------------------------


*by Pip Hunn*

Brian Kibler headed in to the second draft needing to 3-0 to make Top 8. After starting the weekend with two losses, Kibler made a call: he needed to go 12-0 to win. A mere 9-0 in matches (not counting his 3 byes) would put him in the Top 8, but no, Kibler was doing the math to take home the trophy. At the end of the first draft of day two, Kibler has managed to eke out a 6-0 record, putting him halfway there.


Kibler opened pack one and gazed at his cards. Staring back at him was [Ezuri's Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%27s+Brigade) , a powerful card in the right deck. After a moment's reflection, Kibler picked a [Gold Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) . Kibler's strategy for the draft was to stay as open as possible, picking Artifacts even over slightly better colored cards. Kibler's idea was that by remaining open as long as possible, he could take advantage of under-drafted cards in later packs. True to his strategy, Kibler picked a [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) and then the powerful [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) . A [Darkslick Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Drake) indicated Kibler's happiness to go an Artifact-heavy Blue build. Blue seemed to be very open, with solid artifacts like [Chrome Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) and [Horizon Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Spellbomb) coming around to Kibler until late.


Pack two yielded a [Nim Deathmantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Deathmantle) , some small yet useful Myr, a late-pick [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) and a very late [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) . "I think these are a little under-drafted", Kibler opined, "Green based decks tend to be Infect heavy, and this guy doesn't fit in with that strategy, so he goes later than he should."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_Draft2_Kibler.jpg)*Brian Kibler is a most helpful mage to the coverage minions.*
The final pack continued the good times for Kibler, as his reluctance to commit to a second colour gave him the opportunity to snap up an [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) on his second pick. The rest of the pack remained rewarding, with Kibler drafting his second and third [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) as well as nabbing a [Quicksilver Gargantuan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Gargantuan) . In even better news, Kibler drafted a pair of [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) s, which would work nicely with the Blue mythic. Kibler constructed his deck quickly and headed off to the final round of draft play, eager and confident.


 

Feature Match Round 12 - Isaac Egan vs. Brian Kibler
----------------------------------------------------


*by Pip Hunn*

Brian Kibler's been starting each match by listening to "Take Me Where I Wanna Go", by Mirage, and it's been doing him well this weekend. After losing the first two rounds, he's pulled out six straight victories. Another three will get him to the Top 8. Isaac Egan thinks he's won an FNM at some point, but nobody in the crowd will agree with him. When he's not crushing dreams at Grand Prix, he's a mainstay of the Australian **Magic** community, running the Metagames store in Melbourne and hosting tournaments for players of every stripe.


Kibler won the roll and elected to draw. Egan played a [Fume Spitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fume+Spitter) , which traded itself with Kibler's [Gold Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) . Egan followed up with a [Moriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Replica) . After no action from Kibler, the [Moriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Replica) attacked Kibler down to 17. Kibler searched out an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) at the end of Egan's turn and played it, laying down a [Darkslick Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Drake) and passing. Egan had a [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender) , making the flier a less impressive 0/1. Egan attacked with both his creatures, and Kibler took 3 damage, falling to 14.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R12_Egan.jpg)*'Hall of Fame, eh?' Asks Isaac Egan, unfazed.*
Kibler cast [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) , tucking a surprise away for later. He passed the turn to Egan, who swung with all his men. [Darkslick Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Drake) blocked [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender) and died, and [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) intercepted [Fume Spitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fume+Spitter) . The Spitter hawked up something vile to put a -1/-1 counter on the [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) . Kibler had a full grip of cards and was on 12 life, and looked comfortable as he surveyed his options. Egan played a [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton) . Kibler cast a [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) and a [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) , leaving a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) untapped.


The powerful defensive creatures arrayed against Egan gave him pause, before he cast an [Accorder's Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accorder%27s+Shield) . He equipped it to his [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender) and attacked with all his creatures. The [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) died to the [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender) , revealing an Invisimancer. Kibler blocked the [Moriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Replica) with his [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) , then sacrificed it before damage to kill the [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton) . Kibler summoned a [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) , then a second [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) . Kibler attacked with his Invisimancer and passed. Egan attacked with his vigilant [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender) , a [Trigon of Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Rage) making it 6 damage to Kibler, dropping him to 6 life.


Kibler cast a second [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) and attacked with his Invisimancer. Post combat, he cast a [Myr Galvanizer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Galvanizer) and passed, leaving mana open once again for his Replica. Egan attacked with his [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender) . Kibler blocked with his [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) and a [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) . Once the dust had cleared, Kibler had his third Vulshok replica of the game in play.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R12_Kibler.jpg)*No matter how hard Brian Kibler concentrates, he can't seem to conjure any helpful eye laser beams.*
Egan cast a [Bellowing Tanglewurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Tanglewurm) , while Kibler summoned a [Chrome Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) and attacked with his Invisimancer, dropping Egan to 4. Egan attacked with his [Tangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle) wurm. Kibler blocked with his [Chrome Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) and the [Myr Galvanizer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Galvanizer) , leaving his [Vulshok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) out of harm's way. Unfortunately, Egan had an [Untamed Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untamed+Might) , with trample damage coming over for exactly lethal.


"It's harder to expect the [Untamed Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untamed+Might) against a non-poison deck. But I should have realised when you didn't equip the Shield to the [Tangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle) wurm", Kibler said.


**Isaac Egan 1 – Brian Kibler 0**


Egan started with a [Fume Spitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fume+Spitter) and a [Darksteel Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Axe) and brought his beat on. Kibler could only assemble mana and a [Nim Deathmantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Deathmantle) as Isaac continued his assault. Egan summoned a [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton) and Kibler played his first creature, a [Darkslick Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Drake) . Egan's [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender) and [Fume Spitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fume+Spitter) teamed up to kill the Drake while the [Soliton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton) grabbed hold of the Axe and put Kibler to 5. Kibler tried to stabilise with a [Lifesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifesmith) , but Egan trumped him with an [Alpha Tyrranax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Tyrranax) . Kibler gamely blocked, but got eaten a turn later by the gigantic dinosaur.

Sunday, October 10: 4:43p.m. – Round 13: Luis Scott-Vargas vs Satoshi Matsuyama
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Pip Hunn*

Satoshi Matsuyama is looking to make his first Grand Prix Top 8. Flying down from Japan on the strength of one bye, Matsuyama is enjoying his visit to Australia, and his 10-2 record makes the trip seem worthwhile. Luis Scott-Vargas has been a dominant force all tournament. With an imposing resume, including 5 GP and 3 PT Top 8's, the winner of Pro Tour: Berlin, and over 200 lifetime Pro Points, LSV has been running rampant through the field this weekend.


LSV led with an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) , while Matsuyama's Myr was Perilous. LSV summoned a [Moriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Replica) , which attacked unblocked. Post-combat, LSV sacrificed the Replica to fill his hand up, then summoned his own [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) . Matsuyama increased the tempo with a [Trigon of Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Rage) . A [Razor Hippogriff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Hippogriff) from LSV returned the Replica, re-gained the life, and put an imposing flier into the air. Matsuyama took the beats and laid his own five-drop in a [Molder Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) . LSV summoned a [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) , practically daring Matsuyama to attack. Matsuyama took up the challenge and swing in with his Beast, which the [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) and the [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) blocked. Matsuyama increased the power on his [Molder Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) with the Trigon before casting a Grasp in [Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkness) to kill off the [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) . LSV flipped over the imprinted card to reveal... A whiff, as he exiled a land. LSV took 9 damage and then pinged the [Molder Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) with the [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) 's trigger.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R13_Matsuyama.jpg)*Satoshi Matsuyama is sending in his minions.*
LSV quickly rebuilt with a second [Razor Hippogriff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Hippogriff) , getting back his [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) and gaining 5 life in the process. Matsuyama attacked with a [Necropede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropede) and his [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) , which LSV declined to block. Matsuyama sought to shore up the air with an Acid [Web](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Web) spider, but a [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender) from LSV rendered it all but useless against the incoming tide of Hippogriffs. Matsuyama swung with his [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) and dropped LSV to 9, then summoned a [Bleak Coven Vampires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bleak+Coven+Vampires) , gaining some life from the metalcraft trigger.


LSV attacked with both his Hippogriffs and the Spider blocked one, and Matsuyama used his final Trigon counter to kill one of the troublesome fliers. Matsuyama fell to 6 life with no flying defence on the board, and LSV was still at 9 life. He cast an [Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate) for 3, dropping Matsuyama to 3 and going back up to 9 himself. Matsuyama dropped a [Moriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Replica) and activated it immediately, looking for answers, but couldn't find anything to stop the incoming Hippogriff.


Luis Scott-Vargas 1 – Satoshi Matsuyama 0


Matsuyama developed his board with a [Necropede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropede) and a [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) . LSV summoned a swampwalking Horror of his own. Matsuyama cast his [Trigon of Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Rage) and attacked with his [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) , pumping it. LSV had an [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) before things got too far out of hand, attacking with his own swampwalker. Matsuyama was stranded on four [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) s, and could only pass as LSV continued his [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) assault. Matsuyama found a [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) but otherwise had no action.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsyd10/02_R13_LSV.jpg)*"This one," LSV announced, "I shall kill you with this one."*
LSV cast his [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) once again, tucking something away for later. Matsuyama finally found a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and played a [Molder Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) . LSV cast a [True Conviction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True+Conviction) , making all his creatures terrifying in combat. The [Blistergrub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistergrub) alone attacked for 4, putting LSV back up to 19 and dropping Matsuyama to 12. Matsuyama had a second [Molder Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) , but couldn't get through LSV's double-striking defence. Then he cast a [Contagion Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine) , killing LSV's Myr and pumping his [Molder Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) s massively. When Matsuyama attacked with them, LSV blocked with his [Clone Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) , revealing a [Razor Hippogriff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Hippogriff) , which elegantly recycled the Shell and gained a handy 5 life in the process. LSV took his turn to cast a [Moriok Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Reaver) , and Matsuyama was forced to use up his last [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) counter to stave off the Hippogriff. Matsuyama summoned an [Acid Web Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acid+Web+Spider) , which gave him a chance at surviving the air assault.


LSV attacked with his team. Matsuyama assigned blockers and played a [Withstand Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withstand+Death) to keep one of his [Molder Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) s alive. LSV lost several of his creatures, but knocked Matsuyama down to 4, and gained an obscene amount of life in the process from the double strike and lifelink granted by [True Conviction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True+Conviction) . Matsuyama activated his [Contagion Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine) and cleared LSV's board, eager to start clawing away at his life total. It was not to be, though, as LSV simply untapped and cast an [Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate) for the win.


Luis Scott-Vargas defeats Satoshi Matsuyama 2-0.
