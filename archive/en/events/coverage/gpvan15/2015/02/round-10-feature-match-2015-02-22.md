Starting the day with eight wins under your belt puts you in pole position for a run at the Top 8. You can afford another loss, say to the inevitable unlucky matchup, so it feels like you are in control of your own destiny.



**The Players**



Germany’s Florian Koch has been off the radar lately. His career peaked early, with a win at GP Lyon in 2010, and he’s been on and off the Pro Tour since then. He’s on something of a whirlwind tour of US GPs this month, chasing down another qualification. He’s playing the format’s foundation, Abzan.



His opponent, Evan Parker, hails from Calgary and is something of a Modern Constructed maven. This weekend he’s battling with Tarmo-Twin. “I’ve been a Twin player for over a year. I went with this version because it trumps the straight blue-red version.” His record reflects that, with five of his Day 1 wins coming against Twin.




**The Games**



Koch opened with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) that stole [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) from Parker, leaving him with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) and lands. He followed up with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), already out of Bolt range. Parker fetched lands from his deck and waited. Koch added [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) to his board and hit for three. An end-of-turn [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) let him see that Koch was holding [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).



Parker untapped and hit for three. He Bolted away the Ooze when Koch sent his creatures, falling to 11 life. Koch played his [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). He was tight on mana and had no disruption, opening the door for a quick combo victory. Parker gave him a brief sweat with an end-of-turn [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), but didn’t have the Twin to go with it. He just hit with it for one, unwilling to lose his Clique to a Souls token. Koch hit back for five and cleared out the Exarch with [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse). Parker needed action, and quick.

He found [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) and cast it immediately, but had no follow-up. Again Koch’s creatures crashed into the Red Zone. Parker flashed in [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and readied the Bolt in his graveyard as he blocked [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). However, a fourth land for Koch forced a change of plans as [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) hit play and drained Parker down to just one life. He Bolted one of the Souls and prayed for a miracle. None was forthcoming, and he was trampled.



Koch 1 – Parker 0



After Parker’s opening [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) from Koch showed that Parker was holding a pair of [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s, [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), and [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought). Koch took away the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). When he went to play his own a turn later, Parker naturally [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed. Parker untapped and brought out Jace, immediately minusing it for cards. He took [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) over [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) and a land. With Parker’s mana tied up, Koch summoned [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze).



It was a solid board, but Parker was getting way ahead on cards. [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) took down the Ooze with a bonus, and then Parker summoned [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to protect Jace, who upped to three loyalty. Koch wasn’t out of tricks yet, however, and dropped end-of-turn [Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter) Pact on [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Even with Jace’s penalty to attackers, Koch’s ‘Goyf was big enough to kill the Planeswalker. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) stole a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and left Parker with [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Parker’s promising board had been completely upended.



He brought out his Ooze and passed with three open including one green. Koch considered his next move before settling on [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) to get rid of the Ooze. Parker exiled his Jace to shrink the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), but the spell resolved. Koch hit him down to twelve. Parker’s deck refused to cough up any useful tools, and after a blank turn he could only watch as Koch knocked him down to five with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood). Another brick on his draw step, and the match was Koch’s.

**The Aftermath**



As the players de-sideboarded, they chatted about the match. Evan was regretting his decision to  try to keep Jace around. “I think I should’ve just expected you to have removal for my ‘Goyf and just minused to get extra cards.”


Koch agreed. “Preboard I have some, but postboard I go up to I think twelve. I think maybe if you had the combo and needed to bait out removal you could play it that way, but I think it’s just better to cash in Jace.”



“I could’ve got my Ooze out earlier, too. Might have made a difference.”



“I don’t know, I think keeping [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) open and forcing me to play into it is good. If you play your Ooze, I get to play [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), so I think holding it is better.”



They wished each other good luck with the remainder of the tournament.
