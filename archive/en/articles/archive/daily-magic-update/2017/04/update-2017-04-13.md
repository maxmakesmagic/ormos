The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 13, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by The [*Amonkhet* Preview Show](#1), happening this afternoon/evening/night!


What to Watch Today
===================


1. The *Amonkhet* Preview Show | [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)

Looking for the definitive word on *Amonkhet* before you head to the Prerelease? Watch "The *Amonkhet* Preview Show" today! Mark Rosewater, David Humpherys, and Mark Winters will take you inside the world and cards of *Amonkhet*, answering questions from [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) channel subscribers.


Hosted by Marshall Sutcliffe, the stream is on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) starting at 6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT/10 p.m. UTC.


Today's Previews
================


Every day until the full set is revealed on April 14, I'll be sharing all the non-DailyMTG previews you can find around the web in this space. Here are today's:


1. [Exclusive *Amonkhet* Preview: Gideon's Intervention](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/chapman-sim/exclusive-amonkhet-preview-gideons-intervention) | MTG Mint Card | Chapman Sim

I've thoroughly enjoyed the "Look, Gideon, we need to talk" jokes accompanying this card. But I also don't mind Gideon intervening when Saheeli is threatening to throw a million Cats at me.

A strictly better [Inspiration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiration). Or [Weave Fate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weave+Fate), for you young 'uns. Either way, chances are very good I will be playing this card. Probably alongside all the Drake Havens.


1. [*Amonkhet* Preview, Eternal Weekend Europe, and a Restricted Mentor](http://www.eternalcentral.com/so-many-insane-plays-podcast-episode-64-amonkhet-preview-eternal-weekend-europe-and-a-restricted-mentor/) | So Many Insane Plays | Kevin Cron and Steve Menendian

It's not super often we preview a card that could make a splash in Vintage, but this preview card might. It's certainly asking to be broken.


1. <https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMagicTheGathering.ct%2Fposts%2F2092743397618885%3A0&width=500>

That is one angry Minotaur. And, yes, its drawback is merely discarding a card. For your troubles, you get a 4/3 for just two mana. Bloodrage Brawler (its English name) certainly brawls.


1. [Harvest Season](http://weibo.com/2643025570/EEi6gAoT3?from=page_1006062643025570_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime) | Weibo

While the preview image is on Weibo, a Chinese social media site, you can still access the preview card image—and, probably not be able to read it. But, hey, [the internet to the rescue](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/652ztz/ahk_harvest_season/dg723lx/)!


1. [Nouvelle carte *Magic* en exclu *Amonketh* : Début//Fin](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/641785/nouvelle-carte-magic-en-exclu-amonketh-debut-fin.htm) | Jeuxvideo.com

In English, the card is Start to Finish, but I kind of like the French Début//Fin. It sounds more tragic—and the story this card tells is certainly tragic. You can find a [translation of this new uncommon here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/654dnp/akh_d%C3%A9but_fin/dg7c95i/).


1. [Official *Amonkhet* Preview—Cascading Cataracts](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/04/official-amonkhet-preview-cascading-cataracts/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Aaron Gazzaniga

Well, this is certainly interesting. Start brewing up five-color monstrosities without any fear of losing your land mana fixer! Indestructible says these cataracts aren't cascading anywhere.


1. [Mtg: EXCLUSIVE Amonkhet Preview Card: Sandwurm Convergence!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrGTuyYr_zo) | Strictly Better MTG

Sandwurms! And they're converging!

1. [The (Glorious) End of Amonkhet: Exclusive Preview](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/the-glorious-end-of-amonkhet-exclusive-preview) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

If anyone can crack making this card work, it's Seth (probably better known as SaffronOlive).


1. [Spoiler Exclusivo de *Amonkhet*—*Magic: The Gathering* #MTGAKH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL7eC91wK70) | *Magic: The Gathering* Brazil

Oh, I'm sorry, you didn't *need* that [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel), did you? (Yes, yes, translation needed—[try this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6560nt/akh_disposses/dg7o8ot/).)


1. *Magic: Puzzle Quest* | **Coming Soon**

Yup, *Magic: Puzzle Quest*—the game, not the pro team—has its own preview card today that will also be featured in the *Puzzle Quest* release of *Amonkhet*. Watch for it today.


1. [@Blakepr](https://twitter.com/blakepr) | **Coming Soon**

Because what's the point of controlling the preview plan if I can't give myself a preview card?


Synergy of the Day
==================


1. A Sacrifice a Day Keeps the God in the Fray

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_G6k0XamzzE.png)


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hidden+Stockpile)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Stockpile) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zulaport+Cutthroat)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat)
At first blush, Bontu the Glorified has a difficult threshold to be able to attack or block—that is until you remember that [Hidden Stockpile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Stockpile) exists to churn through sacrificial lambs. Well, Servos actually, but you get the idea. With these two cards in play, Bontu can attack every turn, you can scry every turn, and your opponent gets drained for 1 life every turn.


Oh, and if you throw in a [Zulaport Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) or two? Your opponent won't be long for this world.
