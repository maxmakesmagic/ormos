-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our latest set, *Dominaria United*, comes to *Magic Online* this Thursday, September 1, following downtime tomorrow. [Check out today's dedicated article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dominaria-united-magic-online-edition-2022-08-30) to learn all about everything coming with the release:


* Events, including the limited-time Best-of-One Draft League and Limited Challenges

*Dominaria United* Best-of-One Draft League Starts Thursday
-----------------------------------------------------------


For the first time, *Magic Online* is running a Best-of-One Draft League. For two weeks, starting Thursday at 10 a.m. PT (17:00 UTC), join the draft queue and play until you get 7 wins or 3 losses. Full details, including prizes, are found in [the *Dominaria United* article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dominaria-united-magic-online-edition-2022-08-30#draftleague).


This league is perfect if you only have time for a quick game or two between classes, during lunch, before you head out, or after the kids are asleep. If this is your style, give this league a try!


Please note that this league will only be available until September 15, so get your reps in while you can.




---

Limited Challenges Debut This Weekend
-------------------------------------


Our experiment with higher-prize Limited events in August was a success. So, starting this weekend, we present Limited Challenges every Saturday and Sunday at both 1 a.m. and 12 noon PT (08:00 and 19:00 UTC).


In the client, the 1 a.m. PT events will appear as *Limited Challenge 32*, requiring 32 players to fire and are 6 rounds long. The events at noon appear as *Limited Challenge*, requiring 64 players to fire and lasting 7 rounds.


Unlike Constructed Challenges, Limited Challenges do not feature a Top 8 playoff or draft. Also, these events have entry options of 40 Event Tickets or 400 Play Points.


For more information about Limited Challenges, check out [the Dominaria United article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dominaria-united-magic-online-edition-2022-08-30#limitedchallenges).

*Dominaria United* Commander Decks on Sale Thursday
---------------------------------------------------


The new set's two Commander Decks—Painbow and Legends' Legacy—join the MTGO store starting Thursday at 10 a.m. PT (17:00 UTC). Painbow is a five-color-matters deck led by Jared Carthalion, while Legends' Legacy is a red-white-black legendaries-matter deck led by Dihada, Binder of Wills. Each deck is $29.99 plus applicable taxes.

Treasure Chest Update—Including Over 40 New-to-MTGO Cards!
----------------------------------------------------------


We have heard your feedback regarding card availability, particularly for cards that are only available via Treasure Chests. To help improve card availability for cards not found in boosters, a new category within the Treasure Chest has been created: TC-Only.


Also, the MTGO team has delivered on several dozen cards from *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate*, including all Pauper cards with take the initiative, as well as a part of the group of Backgrounds and legends that can choose them. Furthermore, some important cards for Legacy and Commander from both this set (looking at you Kenku Artificer and Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes) and previous Commander sets (hello Maddening Hex) are joining the game.


For more details on the changes to Treasure Chests, click the *Dominaria United* article. You can also visit the [Treasure Chest information page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) to see the effects of the changes.




---

Changes to League Matchmaking
-----------------------------


As an additional step to fight win traders, we are eliminating the "Join Match" confirmation step after pairing in leagues. This change takes effect following tomorrow's downtime.


Once you click Play, your match will begin as soon as you are paired with an opponent, so make sure you are keeping an eye and ear out for the start of your match when you join the queue!


Read more on the rationale behind this change in the *[Dominaria United](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dominaria-united-magic-online-edition-2022-08-30#matchmaking)* [article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dominaria-united-magic-online-edition-2022-08-30#matchmaking).
