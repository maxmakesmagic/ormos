2014 MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP

* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



After seven rounds—including three rounds of Vintage and four rounds of Modern—Jasper De Jong leads the field of sixteen competitors with an undefeated record! He blasted through the Vintage rounds with a brutally efficient Mentor Control deck, and then turned heads with the new Melira & Company deck, a strategy that marries the old combo elements of Melira Pod with the new card advantage trickery found in Collected Company.


With seven more rounds to go tomorrow before a cut to the Top 4, De Jong is in a very strong position to lock his slot on the Sunday stage. Be sure to tune in tomorrow to catch all of the action!
