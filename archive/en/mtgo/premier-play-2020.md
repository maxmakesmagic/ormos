MTGO Premier Play Seasons
--------------------------


The new MTGO Premier Play Program splits the year into seasons of roughly seventeen weeks each.During each season, you'll earn Qualifier Points which can be used to join Split Championship Qualifier events and Champions Showcase events, both of which provide a link to the tabletop *Magic* Split Championship.At the end of the season, we'll reset the Qualifier Points in players' accounts and then start the next season.


* Season 1 of the 2020 MTGO Premier Play Program begins Tuesday, December 10, 2019 and ends Wednesday, April 15, 2020 with the maintenance downtime.
* Season 2 of the 2020 MTGO Premier Play program begins Wednesday, April 15, 2020 and ends Wednesday, August 12, 2020. When seasons coincide with a maintenance downtime, the season will end at the start of that maintenance and the new season will begin when the maintenance is over. For season transitions that happen without a maintenance downtime, the transition will take place at 10:00 a.m. Pacific.
* Season 3 of the 2020 MTGO Premier Play program begins Wednesday, August 12, 2020 and ends Wednesday, December 9, 2020 with the maintenance downtime.


Earning MTGO Premier Play Qualifier Points
-------------------------------------------


During each Premier Play season, players will earn Qualifier Points (QPs) by performing well in various *Magic Online* events. The number of QPs earned will vary by event and finish as indicated by the various event types described below.


Players can use accumulated QPs to enter various Premier Play events over the course of the Premier Play Season as described in the Using Qualifier Points section below. At the start of each MTGO Premier Play Season, all unused QPs will be removed from players accounts and a new season will begin with its own Champions Showcase to qualify for!



Leagues and Queues
===================


The most common way players will earn QPs is through Leagues and Queues. Performing well in these events will provide players with QPs that they can accumulate over the course of the season. Once a player has earned enough QPs, they can use them to join any upcoming Premier Play event in the current season.


For more information on these *Magic Online* event types, check the [Events & Formats](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/events) section of our online [Game Guide](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/gameguide).



Preliminary Events
===================


These 5-round scheduled events are designed for players who prefer a more traditional tournament style and want to earn their QPs in in larger quantities at once. Players who finish a Preliminary Event with either 4 or 5 wins earn 40 QPs, enough to enter an upcoming Premier Event.


Preliminary Events are scattered across the week on a set schedule and include a variety of formats, including most major constructed formats and current sealed deck limited. The full schedule can be found below. Please note, however, that this schedule may be adjusted as needed. Updates will be announced the weekly announcements on <https://mtgo.com/>.

Format Challenges
==================


Held exclusively on the weekends, Format Challenges are Swiss-style scheduled events that feature a Top 8 playoff and provide a big tournament feel. These are great places to practice for Split Championship Qualifiers since the structures are similar with the added benefit of earning a good number of QPs if you do well.


Each format's challenges happen the same time each weekend on the schedule below. Players who do well in the Top 8 of each challenge will earn QPs they can use to join future Premier Play events.


Challenges will be divided into two prize structures based on the minimum number of players: large Challenges require a minimum of 64 players, and small challenges need at least 32. For Seasons 2 and 3, there will be two Challenges each weekend of each format. The Modern Challenge will each be large, while the Standard, Pioneer, Vintage, Legacy, and Pauper Challenges will be small.

Other Rules
------------


Scheduling
==========


Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to add, remove, modify, reschedule, and/or delete any tournament for any reason, including without limitation, if in its sole judgment, that tournament's integrity has been compromised by an unforeseen technical issue and/or error in that tournament's administration.


Entry and Invitations
=====================


For all events that require Qualifier Points or an invitation to enter: if a player believes they should be able to enter the event and cannot, it is their responsibility to contact Customer Service before the event begins (see the Connectivity and Other Event Problems section below). Once the event begins, players cannot be added to the event.


Players who earn a Split Championship Series invitation or *Magic Online* Champions Showcase invitation from a *Magic Online* event will be contacted via the email account associated with their *Magic Online* account by a Wizards of the Coast representative within 72 hours of the qualifying event to verify account information and coordinate the invitation. If you plan on playing in the MTGO Premier Play Program, please ensure that your account information is correct.


Players who have already earned a Split Championship Series invitation (through either tabletop or digital play) are not eligible to participate in further qualifying events (tabletop or digital) that lead to a Split Championship Series in the same tabletop season. The only exception is a player can participate in a *Magic Online* Super Qualifier or a *Magic Online* event that includes both a Split Championship Series invitation and a *Magic Online* Champions Showcase invitation as part of the prizes. In this case, the player cannot earn two invitations to a Split Championship Series in the same tabletop season and any Split Championship Series invitation earned this way will pass down as indicated in the Prizes section below. Note that Split Championship invitations for *Magic Online* Super Qualifiers do not pass down.


Players who have already earned a *Magic Online* Champions Showcase Invitation are not eligible to participate in further qualification events for that *Magic Online* Premier Play Season's Champions Showcase.


Connectivity and Other Event Problems
=====================================


Players who experience issues during a premier play event should contact Customer Service as quickly as possible. Customer Service can be contacted Online via the [Submit a Request](https://mtgo-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000015066) form or on Twitter at [@Wizards\_Help](https://twitter.com/wizards_help). Some events include coverage by Digital Event Coordinators (DECs) who can be contacted by joining the #DEC chat channel in the game client.

Legal Information
------------------



*MAGIC ONLINE* PREMIER PLAY ELIGIBILITY
========================================


For these eligibility rules, *Magic Online* Premier Play is defined as any *Magic Online* tournament or event whose prize structure includes one or more invitations to a future *Magic* Split Championship event (Series or Finals), *Magic Online* Champions Showcase event, *Magic* Mythic Championship event, or another tournament or event that is deemed to be part of the *Magic Online* Premier Play system.


All *Magic Online* players who meet the eligibility requirements set forth herein are eligible to compete in *Magic Online* Premier Play except (a) players who are otherwise ineligible to engage in tournament play pursuant to the *Magic Online* User Agreement and (b) employees and their immediate family members, or contractors of Wizards of the Coast LLC ("Wizards"), Hasbro, Inc. ("Hasbro"), or each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or their advertising or promotion agencies, or those who have been disqualified for other reasons (see below). This is a skill-based tournament based on a player's ability to defeat other players.


Players must be *Magic Online* account holders in good standing and in compliance with the *Magic Online* User Agreement in order to participate in *Magic Online* Premier Play. Players may be disqualified from Premier Play (including the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase and/or the Split Championship Series) if they are suspended from *Magic Online* for any reason, including without limitation, a violation of the *Magic Online* User Agreement.


To be eligible to participate in *Magic Online* Premier Play, the following requirements must be met:


* Players must be at least 18 years of age to qualify for the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase, *Magic: The Gathering* Split Championships, or other related premier play. If a player under the age of 18 would earn prizes that include an invitation for one of these events, the invitation will pass down to the next eligible player as described in the Prizes section below.
* Players must have internet access.
* Players must have access to a personal computer.

Invitations to the Split Championship (including those awarded by participation in tournaments) are governed by the [*Magic: The Gathering* Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Document.aspx?x=Magic_The_Gathering_Premier_Event_Invitation_Policy).


Players who have already earned a Split Championship Series invitation (through either tabletop or digital play) are not eligible to participate in further qualifying events (tabletop or digital) that lead to a Split Championship Series in the same tabletop season. The only exception is a player can participate in a *Magic Online* event that includes both a Split Championship Series invitation and a *Magic Online* Champions Showcase invitation as part of the prizes. In this case, the player cannot earn two invitations to a Split Championship Series in the same tabletop season and any Split Championship Series invitation earned this way will pass down as indicated in the Prizes section below.


Players who have already earned a *Magic Online* Champions Showcase Invitation are not eligible to participate in further qualification events for that *Magic Online* Premier Play Season's Champions Showcase.


Players who compete in Split Championship Qualifier or *Magic Online* Split Championship Qualifier events in violation of these rules will be subject to appropriate penalties, up to and including suspension.


Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for a *Magic Online* Champions Showcase or Split Championship Series event, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in a *Magic Online* Champions Showcase event or Split Championship Series event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the *Magic Online* User Agreement. If you play in *Magic Online* tournaments, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age thirteen to eighteen to play on an account that the adult has established.


Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to reschedule and/or restart tournaments, matches, extend timers and/or games as needed. Such decisions will be announced on the *Magic Online* website, via [@MagicOnline](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline) on Twitter, and/or within the *Magic Online* client as needed.


PRIZES
======


All prizes are awarded "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, express or implied, (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). This is a game of skill and, therefore, there are no odds of winning as is the case with a game of chance. All applicable taxes, fees, duties, tariffs, passport or visa costs, and any license, destination, entry, exit and/or delivery charges are the sole responsibility of each player, and players acknowledge Wizards' recommendation that they consult a tax advisor in their jurisdiction for questions regarding their tax liabilities.


If a player wins that is later deemed ineligible to earn prizes in sanctioned tournaments (such as he or she is suspended and/or a paid contractor), then any invitations earned (*Magic Online* Champions Showcase, Split Championship, or otherwise) will pass down to the player with the next best finish in that event. The final Swiss standings of the Split Championship Series tournament will determine the difference between third and fourth place and the difference between fifth through eighth place, should that be necessary.


In either of the above cases, the booster pack prizes will not pass down to the next player.


Wizards of the Coast may modify, suspend, and/or cancel an event, substitute prizes, or change the costs and/or schedule for an event without notice, at its sole discretion.


EVENT INTEGRITY
===============


If, in the sole judgment of Wizards of the Coast and its representatives, a system error, tournament or rules bug, or other issue has significantly compromised the integrity of the event, Wizards of the Coast retains the right to modify the tournament structure as needed to maintain as fair and competitive an experience as possible for all players.


Occasionally while playing *Magic Online*, Wizards of the Coast staff (marked by a Wizards of the Coast logo beside their online name) may ask players for their name and/or contact information. Failure to provide accurate information may result in significant penalties, up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s).


Do not give out your information to anyone who is not Wizards of the Coast Staff. Wizards of the Coast staff members will never ask for your password.
