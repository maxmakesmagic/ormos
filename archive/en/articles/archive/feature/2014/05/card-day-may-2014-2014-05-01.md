![Colossal Heroics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Colossal+Heroics)
[Colossal Heroics](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossal+Heroics) – *Journey into Nyx*. *Heroics* comes, of course, from *hero*, a Greek word that passed through Latin (and maybe another language) into English. It meant in Latin what it means to us. In Greek, it meant "demi-god." Its singular was *heros* or *heroe* and derived from the [PIE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) root *\*ser-*, "to protect." And *colossal* comes via Latin from the Greek *kolossus*, meaning "big statue." Its origin is unknown. 
 


![Lightning Diadem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lightning+Diadem)
[Lightning Diadem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Diadem) – *Journey into Nyx*. A diadem is an ornamental headband used as a crown. The word follows the fairly typical Greek to Latin to French to English path, and its meaning has remained fairly constant. Ancient Greeks created the word to describe the headband-crowns of Persian kings, which Alexander the Great adopted, from their extant word *diadein*, meaning "to bind around." 
 


![Feast of Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Feast+of+Dreams)
[Feast of Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feast+of+Dreams) – *Journey into Nyx*. The word *feast* comes to English from Middle English, which got it from Latin via Old French. Latin picked up the word from the PIE ([Proto-Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)) root *dhes-*, pertaining to "religious concepts." The same PIE root that eventually gave us "feast" also provided Greek with *theos*, or "god." 
 


![Battlefield Thaumaturge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Battlefield+Thaumaturge)
[Battlefield Thaumaturge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Thaumaturge) – *Journey into Nyx*. As Gavin Verhey alluded to when [he previewed this card](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/295), a thaumaturge is "a miracle worker." It is an Ancient Greek word brought to English via Medieval Latin in the 18th century, and is related to the word thaumaturgy, from *thauma* (marvel/miracle) and "*-ergos/-ergon*" (working). 
 


![Aegis of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aegis+of+the+Gods)
[Aegis of the Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aegis+of+the+Gods) – *Journey into Nyx*. The original [Aegis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis) was a protective item (often interpreted as a shield) owned by Zeus but sometimes wielded by Athena. It's a little unclear. What is clear, though, is that the word spread to Latin and thence unto English, where today it is used in the sense of protecting something (e.g., "under the aegis of"). 
 


![Oakheart Dryads](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oakheart+Dryads)
[Oakheart Dryads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oakheart+Dryads) – *Journey into Nyx*. Setessa (as you probably know) is one of  [the three poleis of *Theros*](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/262c). It is largely populated by women and children, and is [closely associated with the god of harvests, Karametra](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/284). Setessa has not been spared in the war between mortals and their gods, but its [well-trained warriors have acquitted themselves](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/292) well. 
 


![Forgeborn Oreads](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forgeborn+Oreads)
[Forgeborn Oreads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgeborn+Oreads) – *Journey into Nyx*. While he is [talked about quite a bit in flavor text](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&flavor=+%5BPurphoros%5D), Purphoros himself just lets [his hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=his+hammer) do the talking. The god of the forge makes his mark in the block, though, both with cards [named for the forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=%7C%5B%22Theros%22%5D%7C%5B%22Journey+into+Nyx%22%5D%7C%5B%22Born+of+the+Gods%22%5D&name=+%5Bforge%5D) and those [bearing his name](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=+%5BPurphoros%5D).
