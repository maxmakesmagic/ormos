### Game Features


The war against the spirits rages on, and the *Betrayers of Kamigawa* set thickens the plot. Turn the tables on your opponents with Ninja, the patron kami, and brand-new pitch spells.


* **Bushido** -- Creatures that follow the Japanese "way of the warrior" become bigger when they fight other creatures in combat.
* **Ninjutsu --** Whenever you're facing a deck with *Betrayers of Kamigawa* cards, you'll never be sure if that innocent attacker is, in reality, a deadly ninja, ready to cast off its disguise and kill your creatures or ravage your hand or graveyard.
* **Patrons --** The creatures of Kamigawa worship their patron kami, which can come into play shockingly early and have huge, game-swinging effects.
* **Genju --** Even the land gets into the act!

As the spirit war raged in Kamigawa, those close to the daimyo Konda began to fear for his sanity. He remained high above the world, locked away in Eiganjo Castle, and none save his most trusted advisors were given audience. His isolation drove his willful daughter Michiko away from Eiganjo; she sought the truth regarding the war’s beginnings, as well as why her father shut himself off from everything—even his only child.


Meanwhile, the rogue samurai Toshiro Umezawa traveled a winding path across the realm, from Numai—where he survived a soratami assassin’s ambush—to the high reaches of Shinka Keep, then through the orochi colonies deep within Jukai Forest, his fate on a collision course with that of Konda’s daughter. Coerced into servitude by the dread Myojin of Night’s Reach, yet sworn to protect Lady Michiko, Toshiro had to rely solely on his cunning to stay alive.


Even as Toshiro struggled to navigate his way through a maze of allegiances, Michiko traveled to the fabled Minamo School, where she began uncovering treacheries deeper than any imaginable. To make matters worse, the war was taking an unexpected turn: an unimaginably powerful kami, the O-Kagachi, had begun to manifest in the material world, devouring Kamigawa itself piece by piece.


The war with the Spirit World continues.  
**Meet the Betrayers of Kamigawa!**
