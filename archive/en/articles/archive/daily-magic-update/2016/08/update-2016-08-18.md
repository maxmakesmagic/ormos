The August 18, 2016 Update
==========================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on August 18, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the full [*Conspiracy: Take the Throne* Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/conspiracy-take-crown), which will be posted *Monday*. Yes, we normally show off everything on Friday of preview week, but, like everything else surrounding the set, previews are running a little differently this time around.


Today's Previews—Grenzo Day
===========================


In addition to the previews you find on DailyMTG, there are a number of places around the web that will have preview cards themselves. I'll share the ones that have already been posted and point you toward what's coming down the pipeline over the rest of the day.


Today is Grenzo Day. And, just as Grenzo would like it, there's a bit of chaos around when cards will be previewed, as we have a bunch of social media previews today.


1. [Official LR *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* Preview Cards](http://lrcast.com/official-lr-conspiracy-take-the-crown-preview-cards/)! | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

What better place to show off some cards that both give and ask for more information during a draft? You can view the cards at the link above, and you can listen to Marshall and Luis [expound on them here](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-350-conspiracy-take-the-crown-and-fundamentals-of-removal/). And they do love to expound.


1. [Wild Pair](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/category/detail/3187) | Hareruya

Another Japanese preview in Japanese that you (probably) can't read. But, at least this time it's a reprint, so you know what you're looking at. [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) is a, *ahem*, wild card, especially in multiplayer where you have the time to set it up.

Behold, the Grenzoiest of Grenzo cards.


1. [[CN2] Reddit Exclusive - BERSERK!](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4yd5ie/cn2_reddit_exclusive_berserk/) | Reddit

A card Tom Ross would love shows up on Reddit today. What could we possibly do to top this?


1. Coming Later Today

What else do we have in the pipeline today? We'll have twitter previews from [Mark Rosewater](https://twitter.com/maro254) and [Shawn Main](https://twitter.com/shawnmain) coming sometime today. Watch for them.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Cosplay and Art: An Interview with Christine Sprankle and Steve Argyle](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/robertburrows-08182016-cosplay-and-art-an-interview-with-christine-sprankle-and-steve-argyle/) | Gathering Magic | Robert Burrows

The intersection of art and cosplay isn't something that's talked about much, despite their strong symbiosis. Here, cosplayer extraordinaire Christine Sprankle and artist extraordinaire Steve Argyle talk about joining forces to create more cool costumes and experiences.


1. [It's Good to Be Monarch](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/jasonalt-08182016-its-good-to-be-the-monarch/) | Gathering Magic | Jason Alt

Why wait to start brewing? Jason Alt has a take on taking the crown and holding on to it for dear life with a Queen Marchesa-headlined Commander deck. It's Marchesa's world, we're all just playing in it.


1. [Four Approaches to Deck Selection](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33494_Four-Approaches-To-Deck-Selection.html) | StarCityGames.com | Emma Handy

Having trouble figuring out what deck to play? Emma Handy has four approaches to doing just that.


1. [Distended Mindbender Takes Center Stage](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/distended-mindbender/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

[Elder Deep-Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend) and [Emrakul, the Promised End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) might have been the stars of the Pro Tour, but [Distended Mindbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distended+Mindbender) sure had a good week right after. Chapin and Flores break down the power of bending minds and what that means for Standard.


1. [What Is Actually Good](https://soundcloud.com/user-121566285/gam-e11-what-is-actually-good) | GAM Podcast | Gerry Thompson, Andrew Brown, and Michael Majors

All of these *Conspiracy* previews, and the Spikiest of Spikes are still trying to crack the Standard metagame. Thompson, Brown, and Majors spend just short of an hour trying to figure out what's good this week, and talking about how to go about figuring that out.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

There's a lot going on right now. *Eldritch Moon* is still so fresh and so new. *Conspiracy: Take the Throne* previews are happening this week into next. And, let's not forget, *Magic Online* is holding Modern Flashback drafts for the original *Zendikar*, where "if you're blocking, you're losing."


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Grixis Burn](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2016-08-17)

While Blue-Red [Fevered Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) burn is the new hotness, a few enterprising players have started utilizing some black cards to get a leg up on the pseudo-mirror and the rest of the metagame. One such enterprising *Magic Online* player, TRUTHORDARE, recently went 5-0 in a Competitive Standard League with such a deck.


The deck does away with all of the blue cards save [Fevered Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) and some sideboard cards, and stocks up on [Collective Brutality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) and—of all cards—[Alms of the Vein](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alms+of+the+Vein). [Bedlam Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler) gets a nod as the only other creature beyond [Thermo-Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermo-Alchemist), and the rest of the deck is dedicated to drawing cards and burning things—either faces or creatures.


It's an interesting twist on the archetype, but don't be surprised to see more iterations on the [Fevered Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) burn macro-archetype.
