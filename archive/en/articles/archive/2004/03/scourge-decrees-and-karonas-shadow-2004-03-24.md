*Scourge* Decrees and Karona's shadow

![Karona, False God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=KARONA%2C+FALSE+GOD)

The card **[Karona, False God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karona%252C%2BFalse%2BGod)** depicts the *Onslaught* block's "Big Bad" herself, that five-color fusion of [Akroma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma) and [Phage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage), who simultaneously led every mutated tribe on Otaria to war with every other. (See Rei Nakazawa's article, "[Scourge of Otaria](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/150)," for more storyline info on [Karona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona).)


In *card art* terms, [Karona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona)'s influence spreads beyond the five-color Legend itself. In fact, it spills over into Cycling Week territory, because [Karona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona) also appears in the art of the cycle of five rare "supercyclers" from *Scourge*: **[Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice)**, **[Decree of Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Silence)**, [Decree of Pain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Pain), **[Decree of Annihilation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation)**, and **[Decree of Savagery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Savagery)**.


But only as an ominous shadow.


Er... except on the blue one.



[Karona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona)'s shadow, in its characteristic cross-legged, long-robed pose, appears in the four non-blue Decrees, as seen in the art close-ups below. The blue Decree, [Decree of Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Silence), depicts [Karona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona) herself surrounded by glowing energy, as if to cast long shadows on the other four cards...
