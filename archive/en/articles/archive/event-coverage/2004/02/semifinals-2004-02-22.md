Now they get to play for a slot in the finals. They checked each other's deck and discussed their Quarterfinals. Raphael: "My heart is finally beating normally."

Levy never won against Kai and that seemed to be in his mind.

Raphael: "Come on! I have to break the streak sometime!"  
 Kai: "He always says that. Always."  
 Raphael: "My mother is going to be mad with you if I lose again. I keep telling her I lost to the "German guy"."

### Game 1

Budde opened with [Leonin Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder), [Pteron Ghost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost) and [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica) while Levy played land after land. Kai dropped [Oxidda Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem) and finally Levy blinked. He used [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) and [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) to kill the Golem and the Ghost.

Kai played [Loxodon Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) but Raphael had Barbed Lighting for it. Then he played his first creature: a Myr.

Raphael: "Yeah, a creature!"

Again Kai attacked and dropped [Leonin Abunas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas). On the next turn Levy played [Goblin Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica).

Kai (pointing at his Abunas): "That's very good right now."  
 Raphael: "Yes, I know."

Despite Levy's efforts Budde just kept pouring creatures unto the table and attacking every single turn. [Irradiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) took out the Elder when Budde played [Hematite Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem). The game seemed totally lost for the French until he reached seven mana. 

Then he played [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel).

Kai (flipping [Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) onto the table): "Welcome to the real world, Mr. Levy."  
 Raphael: "... Of course."

Kai 1 - Raphael 0.

Game 2  
 Raphael mulliganed amidst a thousand jokes. The second hand still wasn't good enough so he sent it back. He actually showed his five-card hand. Still no lands. At least he was laughing at it.

Raphael: "Stop laughing, Kai. At least mulligan. This is not fair. I'm so much better than you. My deck is SOOOO good."

He kept his four-card hand and dropped [Darksteel Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel), [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and [Darksteel Pendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Pendant).

Raphael: "I'm SO going to win this one."  
 Kai: "Probably."

The German refused to miss a land drop despite Levy's "boo's" and played Vulshok Morningstar and Krak-Clan Grunt. Levy's Pendant yielded his fourth land, [Scavenging Scarab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Scarab) and Krak-Clan Stoker.

Kai: "You are too good for me."  
 Raphael: "I know, I know."

Despite all the jokes Budde's side of the table was all business with [Skyhunter Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol) carrying the Morningstar, [Pteron Ghost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost) and Krak-Clan Grunt. The Scarab attacked and the Patrol tried to block.

Levy showed Kai an [Unforge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unforge).

Kai: "That's not very nice."

Budde sacrificed the Ghost to save his artifact and used [Barbed Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Lightning) to kill Levy's remaining creature dropping him down to two.

Raphael: "Come on Angel!"  
 Kai (reading a card in hand): "[Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins), Instant, Choose One - .."

Levy used Pendant and kept looking through cards before passing the imaginary turn. Kai attacked

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/sf1_2.jpg)Raphael: "What's my life?"  
 Judge: "Minus four."  
 Raphael: "No, really... what's my life?"

Eventually they stopped pretending there was still a game going on. The crowd jokingly boo'd Kai.

Final result: Kai Budde wins 2 - 0 and will now move on to the finals of Grand Prix Madrid.
