We were going to dance around the subject a little and maybe build things up a bit, but then we noticed that the headline for today's arcana clearly reads "*Eventide* Booster Packaging". So there's probably not much mystery about what we're going to be looking at. So let's get it on!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1598_EveBooster_1.jpg)Hmm. That lady has a glowing chest! And she's covered with owls. There's something you don't see every day. How about another one?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1598_EveBooster_3.jpg)That guy's busting all the way out of the pack! Look out world, here comes this guy! Finally, let's take a look at the display box.

*Eventide* previews start on June 30, although the Minisite will come in the previous week. We're not admitting anything, but there *might* be something else before then too...
