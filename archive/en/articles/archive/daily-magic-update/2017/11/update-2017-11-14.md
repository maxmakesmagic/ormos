The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 14, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Storm Crow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow) [Storm Crow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow) [Storm Crow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow) [Storm Crow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow) [Storm Crow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow) [Storm Crow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Crow).


Today's Previews
================


Every day I'll highlight the day's previews found elsewhere on the interwebs (read: not on DailyMTG).


1. [Ladies on the Grind](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/aprilking-11142017-ladies-on-the-grind/) | Gathering Magic | April King

This card seems "fair," and not at all "totally busted in Cube" or "any other format where you might play this." I'm not entirely sure what all the "quotes" are about, but "I'll allow it."


1. [Découvrez en exclusivité une des cartes *Magic* de l'édition humoristique *Unstable* !](http://www.journaldugeek.com/2017/11/14/decouvrez-en-exclusivite-une-des-cartes-magic-de-ledition-humoristique-unstable/) | Journal du Geek | Fabio

Sure, you might not know what the article says, but hey, the preview card is in English!


1. [Official LR *Unstable* Preview Cards](http://lrcast.com/official-lr-unstable-preview-cards/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe

Limited Resources might seem like an odd place to have *Unstable* previews, but this set is even more draftable than you might think. Marshall shows off a trio of dice-rolling cards that power up an archetype focused on manipulating rolls.

A card so weird, only a robot could love it. And also people. This one kind of brings all of us together. We'll laugh about it when the robot revolution happens.


1. [Превью новой карты *Magic: The Gathering*: *Unstable*](https://www.mirf.ru/art/prevyu-novoj-karty-magic-the-gathering-unstable) | Fantasy World

Apparently, it's "hardly working" with the Steamfloggers.


1. [*Magic*: scopri in anteprima una carta di *Unstable*](https://www.redbull.com/it-it/spoiler-unstable-incite-insight-mtg) | Redbull Games Italy

While this card does not, in fact, give you wings, it does give you many, many Contraptions.


1. [*Magic* Memes: Exclusive *Unstable* Preview](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/magic-memes-exclusive-unstable-preview) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

The power level on this card is off the charts. You thought Spike, Tournament Grinder was strong? This card blows it out of the water by many proportions. Plus, you can pitch it to [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will).


1. [*Unstable* Preview: Rules Lawyer (with Judge Promo Bonus!)](http://judgecast.com/archives/1182) | JudgeCast | Jess Dunks

Um, pretty much what the title says. Read on.


1. [Doom has no Snooze Button – TCGplayer *Unstable* Previews](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=14283&writer=Bruce+Richard&articledate=11-14-2017) | TCGplayer | Bruce Richard

So. Many. Contraptions. Seriously, who gave them this many preview cards?


Previews to Watch For
=====================


Just two previews yet to come today.


1. Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

You know them. They know you. They know their preview cards and will show them soon.


1. [Wizards of the Coast Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wizards_magic/)

We have an Instagram page, true story. Granted, I'm too old to be down with this Instagram thing, but my wife tells me all of the youths love it.


In Other News
=============


1. [WizKids Expands Licensing Partnership with Wizards of the Coast](https://wizkids.com/2017/11/14/wizkids-expands-licensing-partnership-with-wizards-of-the-coast/)

*Magic: The Gathering* miniatures? I could get behind that. I would like to reserve all the [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) and [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) miniatures, please and thank you.
