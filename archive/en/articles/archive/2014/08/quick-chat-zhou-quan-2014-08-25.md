 Zhou Quan is pretty well-known in Mainland China. In fact, he is the defending champion of this event, having won Grand Prix Beijing 2013 less than a year ago. Swimming past a pool of nearly 900 players, he successfully defended the trophy by beating Nonthakorn Kositaporn of Thailand in the finals, with the aid of [Gift of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Orzhova).
