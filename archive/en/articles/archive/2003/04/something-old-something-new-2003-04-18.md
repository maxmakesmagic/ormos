Often times a large expansion will contain repeats of staple cards. For a long time, most large sets included [Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) and [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), among others. Occasionally, a set will contain a card "functionally identical" to another card, but without the same name, thus making it not a "true" repeat. For example, [Barbary Apes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbary+Apes) is functionally identical to [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears).


Below are nine creatures from *Mirage*. Some of them are "functionally identical" repeats of cards from earlier sets, and some were themselves copied in such a way in later sets. Do you know what each card is called in its "other" incarnation? Click each to find out.


Again, "functionally identical" means the same mana cost, power/toughness, and rules text.
