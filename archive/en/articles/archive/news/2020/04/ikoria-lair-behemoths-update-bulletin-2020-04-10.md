Hello, everyone!


Normally, I have a couple paragraphs of flavorful introduction here related to the plane we're visiting. But on Ikoria, I'm RIDING A FLYING SHARK, so yeah, just go on and read the details. Wheeee!


As usual, you'll be able to find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website, and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/)â€”at this time, one or both of those might not be updated just yet, so I'm describing a general truth here. Keep in mind that this article was written before the rules changes were finalized in editing, so there may be minor deviations from what I describe below.
