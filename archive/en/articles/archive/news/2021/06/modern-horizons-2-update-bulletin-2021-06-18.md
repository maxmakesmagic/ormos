Hello, everyone!


*Modern Horizons 2* is a celebration of *Magic* and the Modern format that highlights popular mechanics and pushes the boundaries of card design in exciting ways.

Most of these changes were small (Clue is a predefined token now!), but some of these were quite extensive (I'm looking at you [Thrasta, Tempest's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrasta%2C+Tempest%27s+Roar)!).
