In this week's Community Spotlight, we're spotlighting the Wizards Communty. Confused?

Specifically, we mean the [official forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/viewcategory/75842/Magic_The_Gathering). In our forums, you can find such wonders as ...

### [The magicthegathering.com forum](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75842/134894/magicthegathering.com)

* The forum for discussion of articles on the site you're now reading. Probably not the most important part of the forums, but it's the one that's about the website, so we're putting it first anyway.

### [Rules Q&A](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75842/134778/rules_qamp;a)

* A great resource for getting your rules questions answered by gurus and all-around smart people.

### [Magic Art and Artists](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75842/134850/magic_art_and_artists)

* Do you like the art? This is where you will find people to talk to about it! Incidentally, as we write this, the most recent post in this forum was by **Magic** artist [Pete Venters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Pete+Venters%22%5D).

### [Flavor and Storylines](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75842/134866/flavor_and_storylines)

* Discussion of the **Magic** storyline and general flavor.

There are other subforums, of course, devoted to casual and tournament play of every description. But at this point, we'd just be reiterating what's on [the main forum page](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/viewcategory/75842/Magic_The_Gathering).
