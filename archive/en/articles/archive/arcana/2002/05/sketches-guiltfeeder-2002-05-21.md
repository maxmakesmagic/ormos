*Judgment* is the green and white set, but even black got a couple playable cards. This week's Sketches looks at one of them, [Guiltfeeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guiltfeeder) by Mark Tedin.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This card should show a monster that glides through shadows to reach you. If it touches you, it causes you intense guilt, feeding off your memories of the past, and the remorse causes you harm, thus the life loss. If you can depict this in some way that would be great, but the main focus of this card is the monster. He should probably be shown as a creepy shadow form."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Mark. Mark submitted two sided-by-side along with his own notes. The card was known as "Jowser's Shadowcreeper" during development; "Jowser" is an anagram of "W. J. Rose." Bill Rose is the head of R&D here at Wizards of the Coast.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. Mark gave the victim some more hair and a beard.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
