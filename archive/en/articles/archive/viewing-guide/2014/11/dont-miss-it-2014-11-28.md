Five days; 24 of the world's greatest competing in four different formats; 72 countries, represented by teams of four, competing in one of the most energetic and emotional *Magic* tournaments of the year. It's 2014 Worlds Week and, as always, it is going to be awesome.


[Coverage of 2014 Worlds Week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC) begins on Tuesday, December 2, at 9 a.m. local time/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/8 a.m. GMT with the first day of the 2014 World Championship. You won't want to miss a minute, because the 24 players will start off the tournament with a real-life *Vintage Masters* draft, followed by three rounds with the decks drafted. Four rounds of Modern Constructed conclude Day One.

Day Two continues at the same stream start times on December 3, with three rounds of *Khans of Tarkir*Booster Draft and then four rounds of Standard before a cut to the Top 4.


The 2014 World *Magic* Cup begins two days after that, on December 5, at 10 a.m. local time/1 a.m. PT/4 a.m. ET/9 a.m. GMT. All 72 countries compete through three rounds of *Khans of Tarkir*  [Team Sealed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/teamsealeddeck) followed by four rounds of [Team Unified Standard Constructed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/teamunified). The Top 32 teams will return on Day Two.

Day Two of the 2014 World *Magic* Cup takes place December 6 at the same stream times from December 5. The 32 returning teams will compete in seeded pools (eight pools of four teams each). The format? *Khans of Tarkir* Team Sealed. The top two teams from each pool will advance to the second Team Pool competition of the day, where eight pools of four teams each compete in three rounds of Team Unified Standard.


The top two teams from each pool at the end of Day Two will advance into the Top 8, which begins on Sunday, December 7 at 9 a.m. local time/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/8 a.m. GMT. The Top 4 playoff for the 2014 World Champion begins shortly after the conclusion to the 2014 World *Magic* Cup.


The coverage team for this event, by the way, is massive. Over the course of the five days, the video coverage will feature video headmaster Rich Hagon, Pro Tour historian Brian David-Marshall, Limited Resources all-star Marshall Sutcliffe, North American coverage producer Rashad Miller, European coverage star Tim Willoughby, Hall of Famer Randy Buehler, Pro Tour San Diego 2009 champion Simon Goertzen, and Hall of Famer Ben Stark.


Then there's the text team, the European community team, the Walking the Planes crew, the photographer, and the many people working tirelessly behind the scenes all week to bring you one massive, spectacular show.


Pro Tours are quite a production, but Worlds Week is something else entirely. You won't want to miss it. It all starts on Tuesday, December 2, on the [*Magic* Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic).
