Listen. This is important.

Starting with ***Magic** 2011*, intro packs are going to be sixty cards. And they still come with a 15-card booster! The MSRP, if you are curious (and why wouldn't you be?) is $12.99.

Now, how about we take a look at these (sixty-card) decks?

### Blades of Victory

With angels at your side and Angelic Arbiter at the forefront of the battle, can victory be far behind?

  
### Power of Prophecy

Gain knowledge of the future and use Conundrum Sphinx to hasten your foretold dominance.

  
### Reign of Vampirism

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/457_intropack3.jpg)Unleash a horde of the undead! As your army of vampires descends upon your opponent, your Captivating Vampire will boost your odds of victory.

  
### Breath of Fire

### Stampede of Beasts

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/457_intropack5.jpg)Summon monstrous beasts, wurms, and hydras, and use them to stomp your opponent’s forces like insects. Then cast Overwhelming Stampede to give your forces a lethal boost of power.
