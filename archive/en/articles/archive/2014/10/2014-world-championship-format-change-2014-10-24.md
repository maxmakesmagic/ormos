The 2014 World Championship, which takes place on December 2, 3, and 7 in Nice, France, will be undergoing a minor shift in which formats competitors will play on which days.


On Day One, players will compete in three rounds of real-life *Vintage Masters* Booster Draft followed by four rounds of Modern. *Vintage Masters* booster packs will be generated on *Magic Online* and physically re-constructed for this event.


On Day Two, players will compete in three rounds of *Khans of Tarkir* Booster Draft followed by four rounds of Standard.


The Top 4, which takes place on December 7, will be played using the Standard Constructed decks that the players used on Day Two of the event.


The Event Information page for the [2014 World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-2014-magic-world-championship) has been updated with this information, and competitors will be notified of these changes today.
