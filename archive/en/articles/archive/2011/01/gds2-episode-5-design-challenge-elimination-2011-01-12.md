GDS2, Episode 5: Design Challenge Elimination
=============================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles?source=MX_Nav2020)
 on December 3, 2013 










Time to eliminate another candidate. It's definitely getting harder each time, After today, there will only be four designers remaining. I will list each designer's name. If you click on it you will see whether they are in or out. Candidates that are in will have a green **CONTINUE PLAYING**. The candidate that is eliminated will have a red **GAME OVER**. I will then give a short summary of where I feel they stand or why they were eliminated.

### Ethan Fleischer




 


 




### Scott Van Essen




 


 




### Jonathon Loucks




 


 




### Devon Rule
