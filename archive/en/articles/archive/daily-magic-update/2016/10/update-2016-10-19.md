The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 19, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by a return to form.


Today's Must
============


1. [Revisiting Standard Rotation](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/revisiting-standard-rotation-2016-10-19) | Wizards of the Coast | Aaron Forsythe

It's not often that I highlight one of our articles on here, since if you found this, you probably can also find something else on our site. But this one is important enough that I'm going to have to insist you read it. We're changing Standard rotation—back to how it used to be. [Read more from Aaron Forsythe](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/revisiting-standard-rotation-2016-10-19).


I expect by the time you read this, there will be a number of reaction videos and articles popping up (like [this one](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13568&writer=Corbin+Hosler&articledate=10-19-2016) from TCGPlayer or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAghYOHg_rU&feature=youtu.be) from Tolarian Community College). We'll try to cover them all tomorrow to get a sense of the community's reactions (which, so far, have been very positive).


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Meddling Nissa, Nature's Artisan](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/jaykirkman-10192016-meddling-nissa-natures-artisan/) | Gathering Magic | Jay Kirkman

Kirkman walks through modifying and updating the [Nissa, Nature's Artisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Nature%27s+Artisan) Planeswalker Deck. The Planeswalker Decks are great places for newer players to start, and building it up and refining it is a good way to find your way at building and constructing decks.


1. [Mardu Zoo at Pro Tour Honolulu](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/mardu-zoo-at-pro-tour-honolulu/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Frank Karsten just wanted to go *fast*. So he picked the fastest deck around—what he's calling Mardu Zoo, but what we called Mardu Vehicles at the Pro Tour—and sped his way through Pro Tour *Kaladesh*. Here he breaks down and updates the deck, plus talks *Kaladesh* Limited.


1. [Instant Deck Tech: Mono-Blue Metallurgic Rise (Standard)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/instant-deck-tech-mono-u-metallurgic-rise-standard) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

As a big fan of the Mono-Blue [Jace's Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Sanctum) deck in the last Standard, I always enjoy the new variations on mono-blue decks, especially with a *Kaladesh* twist. This one (the deck is credited to Ikuta Masaya) uses [Metallurgic Summonings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallurgic+Summonings) and a ton of spells to control the game and, eventually, take down the opponent. Plus, it has the most beautiful set of lands anywhere—25 Islands.


1. [Card Draw and Card Advantage](https://rocketjump.com/listen/127) | The Command Zone | Josh Lee Kwai and Jimmy Wong

Card draw and card advantage have been two bedrock principles of *Magic* for a long time—but they mean a bit more in Commander, where card draw can come in the form of 20 at a time or a 30-for-1. Josh and Jimmy review just what these terms mean and why they're important to making your friends throw their hands in the air when you play your [Azami, Lady of Scrolls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azami%2C+Lady+of+Scrolls) deck. But it's all foil! How can I not?!


1. [*Kaladesh* Art Book Preview](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikelinnemann-10192016-kaladesh-art-book-preview/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann

*Kaladesh* has some gorgeous, bright art, and the art book for *Kaladesh* will be releasing soon. Mike Linnemann shows off two exclusive pages and talks a bit about what the book has in store.


Paste [had a similar preview](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/10/kaladesh-artbook-preview.html) of different content for you art aficionados.


Top 25
======


1. Yasooka on top

For the first time in quite some time, we have a new No. 1 on the *Magic* Pro Tour Top 25—Shota Yasooka!


After winning [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptkld) in impressive fashion, Yasooka claimed the No. 1 spot from new No. 2 Owen Turtenwald by a slim margin. Long considered one of the world's most impressive technical players, Yasooka can now add top-ranked player in the world to his list of accolades.


But he isn't even the biggest mover. Yuuya Watanabe jumped up eleven spots after a solid Pro Tour, while Lee Shi Tian joined the rankings at No. 19. 


Congratulations to everyone who joined the Top 25, and a special congratulations to Shota Yasooka, the new No. 1-ranked player in the world.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Wow! This is massively (good) news for Budget/Casual players. Back to one rotation a year! <https://t.co/vo2IkOEnAh>
> 
> 
>  — Saffron Olive (@SaffronOlive) [October 19, 2016](https://twitter.com/SaffronOlive/status/788751888795795456)

If I'm going to put our news at the top of the Daily Update, it shouldn't be a surprise that people start talking about it. Our goal with reverting to the old rotation was certainly to help players who couldn't keep up with the rotation, which, from feedback we received, was a significant number. We believe this should help.


1. [Mark Rosewater's When/If responses, one year later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/587745/mark_rosewaters_whenif_responses_one_year_later/)

On Mark Rosewater's [blog](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/) and in his articles, he often answers questions with the framing of "if/when," as in "Do you think cycling will ever return?" Answer: "I think it's a matter of when, not if, it returns." (Not an actual exchange). Well, one Reddit user compiled all of Rosewater's answers to these questions, then checked in a year later to see where we were at with all of them. The list is certainly interesting.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Black-Red Zombies](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2016-10-18)

It's easy enough to get stuck in the mindset that only decks from the Pro Tour matter, but the weeks after the Pro Tour is when the metagame really settles in and decks that didn't shine at the Pro Tour start to have their moment in the sun.


One such deck is Black-Red Zombies, which was certainly present at the Pro Tour, but didn't really make a ton of waves. Nonetheless, Mogged took the list below to a 5-0 record in a Competitive Standard League on *Magic Online* recently, and the list typifies what the deck is trying to do—play resilient threats and bring them back from the graveyard.


The deck has a number of interesting play patterns. You often stop playing lands at three or four so you can discard them to the plethora of outlets the deck has. It has no blue sources, but plays 4 [Prized Amalgam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam)s, just with the plan of discarding them and bringing them back. The deck actively wants to be discarding cards.


And yet, it also plays out much like a slightly slower aggressive deck. [Scrapheap Scrounger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger) is surprisingly aggressive, and [Smuggler's Copter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) unsurprisingly so.


A resilient aggressive deck? Sounds like just the kind of thing that might give all of the Jeskai and Grixis Control mages a run for their money...
