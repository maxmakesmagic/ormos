Today we take a peek at the *Guildpact* style guide to see how the look and feel of this simultaneously scattered and sublime guild came together. 


*A style guide is a document of text and reference illustrations used to guide artists who work on a **Magic** set. The concept illustrations shown in this Arcana are all by *Guildpact's* lead conceptual artist, D. Alexander Gregory.*


As you can see below, the wizards of the Izzet guild dress in flamboyant and alchemically-boosted clothing. This guild is funded by a dragon's hoard, after all -- a dragon who has lived for thousands of years. Think of the compound interest! You can see examples of Izzet wizards on cards like [Izzet Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Guildmage), [Izzet Chronarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Chronarch), [Stitch in Time](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitch+in+Time) and [Tibor and Lumia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tibor+and+Lumia).

![Guildpact style guide images by D. Alexander Gregory](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1025_style2.jpg)The Izzet employ more than one kind of assistant in their mad experimentation. There are the [weirds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=weird&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=31&y=24), walking fusions of opposing elements originally invented by [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Niv-Mizzet%252C%2Bthe%2BFiremind) himself. And then there are the wizard wannabes, the Izzet goblins. Check out these two diminutive apprentices (right) doing gruntwork for some Izzet mage. Note the art of [Frazzle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frazzle), [Mimeofacture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimeofacture) and of course [Goblin Flectomancer](/en/articles/archive/goblin-forkomancer-2006-02-28) to see more examples of Izzet goblins based on these fellows. 


You don't get to see much of Izzet *soldiers*, but they exist, defending Izzet interests in the Tenth District and beyond. One design, clad in copper and gold armor, is shown above. Below you can see some designs for Izzet weaponry -- note the frequency of copper, a heat-conductive and alchemically-important metal. You can see Izzet soldiers in action in the art of [Leap of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leap+of+Flame).

Interestingly, many of the weapons held high in the art of [Sword of the Paruns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Paruns) were clearly inspired by these Izzet weapon designs.
