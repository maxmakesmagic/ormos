DAY 1 COVERAGE



After nine rounds of Standard, the original field of 926 was whittled down to just 304 players. They would return on Sunday for another six rounds followed by the Top 8 playoffs.


Leading the charge into the second day were four players at 9-0: Alessandro Aristei, Alain Bardini, Bart van Etten, and Andrea Sonzogni (pictured above left to right). But fierce competition wasn't far behind. Just among the people who finished the day with a record of 8-1 one could find names like Alessandro Lippi, Pavel Matousek, Dario Parazzoli, Raul Porojan, Loïc Le Briand, and Robin Dolar—and that's just listing those with multiple previous Grand Prix Top 8 finishes.


So tune back in tomorrow to watch some of the game's best and brightest play for that coveted Top 8 berth and eventually for the trophy and the title of champion of Grand Prix Turin 2017!
