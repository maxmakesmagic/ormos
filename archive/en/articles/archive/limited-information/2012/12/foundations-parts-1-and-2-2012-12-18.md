Steve Sadin wrote Limited Information for nearly five years before stepping down from the column (but not coverage!) earlier this month. His final two articles create something of a retrospective of his work while pointing out the fundamentals of Limited formats. Steve leaves on a high note with these articles, which we feel are themselves excellent examples of his finest works. We therefore hope you also enjoy "Foundations." 

 Happy Holidays!
