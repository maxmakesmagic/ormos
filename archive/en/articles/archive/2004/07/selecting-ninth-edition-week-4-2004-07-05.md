Welcome to the fourth week of [Selecting *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/home)! [Last week's vote](/en/articles/archive/selecting-ninth-edition-week-3-2004-06-28) was nowhere near as close as [Blinding Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Angel) vs. [Dawn Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Elemental), but there was still an incredible amount of spirited debate on the merits of both cards. The results?

**[Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) wins!**  

 




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) | 9748 | 64.7% |
| [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) | 5324 | 35.3% |
| **Totals** | **15072**  | **100%** |

Whereas last week featured two constructed-level cards, this week is much more likely to matter for **Magic**'s more casual players. In honor of Demon Week, you'll be choosing between [Yawgmoth Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth+Demon) and [Havoc Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havoc+Demon). [Yawgmoth Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth+Demon) comes with one of the most powerful names in the game (thanks to cards like [Yawgmoth's Bargain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Bargain) and [Yawgmoth's Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Will)) and a powerful nostalgia factor, having appeared all the way back in **Magic**'s second expansion, *Antiquities*. [Havoc Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havoc+Demon) costs more to cast and is smaller to boot, but features a powerful board-sweeping ability, whereas ending up unable to pay off your [Yawgmoth Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth+Demon) is a good way to end up dead fast.


So which will it be? Both demons are looking to make their first appearance in a core set. Does *Mirrodin's* artifact theme mean [Yawgmoth Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth+Demon)'s time has come? Will [Havoc Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havoc+Demon) pull off the chance to bring more screams of pain to the little (and not-so-little) critters of **Magic**? The choice is yours, so get your vote in and come back next week to find out which card won!

Thanks for making your voice heard. We’ll see you next Monday (and every Monday through September 6th) with even more important changes to your next Core Set. Don’t miss it!
