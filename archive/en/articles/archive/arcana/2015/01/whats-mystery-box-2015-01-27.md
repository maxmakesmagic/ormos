While hanging out at your Prerelease or Release events over the past few weeks, you might have noticed some attractive artwork hanging out on the outside of a box that looks a little bit like this:

That's some great [Mox Ruby](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Ruby) alternative art there, but the box is still a bit of a mystery (Oooooh! Mystery Box!). Let's take a closer look. Jace (of the [Funko POP!](http://funko.com/collections/magic-the-gathering) variety) for scale.

Okay, so it's a box with Moxes on the side. The shiny plastic wrap sure looks nice, but what's it for? Is it a boat? Does it even open?

Okay, that question has been answered in picture form, but, seriously, what's in the box? WHAT'S IN THE BOX?!?!

It's storage! A lot of storage, actually. A Cube's worth of storage.



So what this former mystery box actually is, is the [MOX CUB3 from UltraPRO](http://www.ultrapro.com/product_info.php?products_id=3115) designed for, well, Cubing. It can hold up to 900 standard double-sleeved cards and, in addition to the two-level design you see above, it also has this bit that Jace is checking out:

That adorable drawer is perfect for dice, counters, or anything else tiny and useful when Cubing or playing *Magic* in general. Jace certainly approves, even if he doesn't quite fit.



The box is useful for more than just Cube, even, offering plenty of storage space and quite a bit of flexibility. For example, when it's not storing your Pauper Cube or reams of *[Conspiracy](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/conspiracy)* draft sets, it also serves as a suitable lounging spot for Funko POP! Planeswalkers.

The MOX CUB3 is in stores now and retails for $89.99.
