This vote was one of closest votes we’ve had in quite a while. In the end, function won out, but not by the largest of margins.

| **How should we design the card?** |  |  |
| By function | 6645 | 55.8% |
| By flavor | 5263 | 44.2% |
| **Total** | **11908** | **100%** |

This means that it’s time to start submitting mechanics. For those of you not around for the last “You Make the Card,” here’s how it’s going to work. You will have until this Sunday to submit mechanics. Then I (with some help from the rest of R&D) will narrow down the mechanics to ten. This will take a few weeks if you all are anywhere near as prolific as last time. The public will then vote on which mechanic they want.


But, of course, there are some rules. (There are always some rules.)


1. **Each person may submit one mechanic idea.** Due to an overwhelming response from the first “You Make the Card,” I regrettably have to limit all of you to one mechanic per person. After a mechanic is submitted, we will not look at any more. So please, think about what you wish to submit before blindly sending in an idea.
2. **Do not send anything but the rules text for your card.** The rules text is what is written in the text box of the card. We do not need (nor want at this point) the artifact's name or mana cost. I will state this last part once again since I don’t want any confusion. DO NOT list the mana cost (what used to be called casting cost) of the creature. We will be deciding this later.
3. **Use the letter "M" for specific mana costs for activations.** To separate the mechanic’s ability from its power level, we are asking for mana costs not to be specified. For example, if you wanted a card that tapped, spent some mana and drew a card, you would write “M, Tap: Draw a card.” We will understand that the "M" stands for a mana cost. Other costs, such as sacrificing a creature, should be listed.
4. **Keep it simple.** The number one mistake beginners make when designing a card is to make the rules text too long. A good guideline is about 140 characters -- any more than that and there will be no room for flavor text (and we want flavor text). If your mechanic goes much more that 140 characters, it's probably too long. Keep in mind that proper templating might lengthen the text.
5. **We are looking for originality.** Please do not submit old cards in the hopes that we will repeat it or print it with a lower mana cost. We are looking for something new and different.
6. **Design a non-creature artifact.** This might be stating the obvious, but we had some problems last time. The public has chosen artifacts, so we are making an artifact. Do not turn in mechanics for anything but an artifact. Also, the public chose non-creature, so do not turn in an artifact creature. (Although an artifact that turns into a creature is still fair game.)
7. **The first person submitting a mechanic will get credit.** It is quite possible for more than one person to submit a mechanic. As we have no way to cross reference the proposals, we are going to give credit to the first person who turns it in.
8. **Any submitted idea becomes the property of Wizards of the Coast.** In order to be able to give you all this opportunity, Wizards of the Coast has to be able to legally protect itself. (Full legal text is provided if you continue on.) If this makes you uncomfortable, please do not submit any ideas.

Unfortunately, you are either not logged in or not registered. Click **here** to do so, and then reload this page to submit your mechanic.


Time for you all to have some fun. Click **[here](#)** to submit your mechanic. The deadline for mechanics is midnight, Sunday, March 23rd.


This the fun part of design, so please enjoy yourselves.


Mark Rosewater
