Coming to a phone near you, the [official *Magic* companion app, *Magic: The Gathering Portal*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/CompanionApp)—just not quite as soon as we thought.


With *Guilds of Ravnica* releasing on October 5, inside that product you'll see some advertisements for *MTG* *Portal* encouraging you to try out the app. At the time we commissioned those ads, we were optimistic about the timing of the app and went ahead and included those advertisements in the product. We were very excited to launch the new way to interact with *Magic* alongside a new Standard rotation and a return to one of our most popular planes.


However, as we got closer to the date we had hoped to launch our limited beta test, it became apparent that *MTG Portal* was not ready for where we wanted it to be for our players. An official *Magic: The Gathering* app is something players have been requesting for a long time, and we want to make sure we get it right.


We believe *MTG Portal* in its final form will be an essential tool for gamers who love *Magic*, full of useful tools like a tournament organizer, a card database, searchable rules, and a life counter with some handy options.


We are not rushing quality, and as such we are not yet ready to announce the new date of the limited beta test of the app. Watch this space and follow [@wizards\_magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic) for more updates as we get closer.


In the meantime, enjoy *Guilds of Ravnica* and the *Magic: The Gathering Arena* Open Beta, and watch for more news on *MTG Portal* in the coming weeks!
