**The Legacy Festival Begins June 8**


*Magic Online* has festivals to celebrate a format and its players, as well as to encourage others to join in on the fun. Interested in playing Legacy but haven't given it a try? Already play and want to get your friends to join you? This festival is the time! The Legacy Festival will walk players through the essential steps to discovering a format:


* DISCOVER: A way to try out the format. Learn about the different decks, see what the metagame is like, and find a deck that you want to play.
* ASSEMBLE: Play the new *Eternal Masters* set for an an opportunity to acquire cards you'll need for your deck.
* CONQUER: Once you've gotten your deck together, a way to play for some sweet prizes when you jump in and take on the competition.

Interested in trying out Legacy? The Legacy Festival begins on June 8 with Legacy Gauntlet Events! Get the full event details [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-legacy-festival-discover-assemble-conquer-2016-05-13) and check back tomorrow for an article by Game Designer Adam Prosak that talks about Legacy Gauntlet decklists.

**The Year of Modern Flashbacks Resumes**


It's 2016: the Year of Modern Flashbacks! If you want to build up a collection for Modern, these Flashback Drafts add everything you draft to your collection once the event is over. Even if Modern isn't your thing, you can enjoy a leisurely draft through the planes of the past with rotating formats each week!


Triple *Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts begin Wednesday, June 1, after the downtime, and are followed up with a *Lorwyn*-*Lorwyn*-*Morningtide* Flashback Draft. The [full Flashback Draft schedule](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/year-of-modern-flashbacks-2015-12-14) has been updated with formats throughout the rest of the year, so mark your calendar for the formats you're most excited about!

**Upcoming Standard PTQ on Sunday, June 5**


Attention all Pro Tour hopefuls: a Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) is approaching! The Standard Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries begin Thursday, June 2, and run through Sunday, June 5. We hope to see you in the PTQ Finals on Sunday, June 5! This is the first *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier that leads to Pro Tour *Kaladesh*.


Remember, you are no longer required to enter into the PTQ Finals immediately following the Preliminary that you qualified through, thanks to the redesigned PTQ system that *Magic Online* Events Manager Lee Sharpe announced [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-qualifier-changes-2015-11-16).

**Upcoming Skipped Downtime on June 8**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we're simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we'll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* June 8
* June 22
