### PRO TOUR KHANS OF TARKIR


DRAFTING 5-COLOR WITH ARI LAX
=============================

 Looking at *Khans of Tarkir* as a draft environment, the most obvious conclusion you'd draw is that everyone's going to draft one of the three-color "wedge" combinations centered around the *Khans of Tarkir* clans, but apparently it's not as simple as that.



Early rumblings suggested that both two-color decks with a splash to round out the clan were equally desirable, as were decks spread further afield into four or five colors. Then things started getting really interesting when we started to hear rumors of players drafting nonbasic lands as aggressively as possible to potentially starve the rest of the draft table of their color fixing.


Naturally, we wanted to hear more about draft strategies that actively interacted with the rest of draft table long before anyone shuffles up for a game, so we kept our eye on any spicy looking five-color concoctions this weekend, and it wasn't long before one splashed across our screen.



 As we circled around our featured draft at the start of Day Two, our eyes were on Mike Sigrist and 11th-ranked Yuuya Watanabe, who were our two remaining undefeated players, but drafting just down-stream from there was Ari Lax, who at that point had only a single loss to his name. As we pieced together the draft viewer afterwards, it became abundantly clear Lax had assembled something special. I mean, he was playing both [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade) and [Zurgo Helmsmasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zurgo+Helmsmasher) for a start.





*Ari Lax displays the stars of his deck. It's like one of those comedy movies about completely mismatched twins.*
