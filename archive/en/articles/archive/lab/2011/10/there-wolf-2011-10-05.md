Wolves. They can be pretty vicious creatures. Lithe and swift, wolves are not beings to be underestimated. If you were alone in a dark forest, you'd be scared of wolves. Well, probably anything, but wolves fall under the "anything" umbrella. That's my favorite umbrella.

What was I saying? Right, wolves. See, some wolves are particularly powerful and frightening, because they take human form and walk among the rest of us. Isn't that freaky? The worst part is that these transformations hinge upon the moon, which comes out on a regular basis. So with a touch of moonlight, that guy you were strolling along with/having an argument with might turn into a vicious monster and rip out your lymph nodes.
