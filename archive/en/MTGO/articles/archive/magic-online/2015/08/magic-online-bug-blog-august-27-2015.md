Known Issues List Updates
=========================


This week, we've added several new additions to the Known Issues List, as well as a few temporary workarounds. A log of these changes can be found below. We've also made a pass over the Known Issues List to combine issues where applicable and remove outdated or redundant bugs.


In other updates, we've removed the "Server" section from the Known Issues List. When we began this list, including a section specifically for server issues seemed important, but, as we categorize known issues and continue to publish this blog, we've realized that issues filed as "Server" internally tend to manifest as client or game play issues from a customer's point of view. Because of this, we've taken existing issues categorized as "Server" and sorted them into the "Game Play" and "Client" sections.


The [Known Issues List](#list) has been updated to reflect these changes, so refer to that for the most up-to-date statuses on *Magic Online* known issues. If you want to see the history of fixed known issues, refer to the [archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-fixed-known-issues-archive).

**Newly Added Known Issues as of Thursday, August 27** 


**Game Play**


 


* Cardset | [Demonic Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact) does not identify the modes already used while on the battlefield.
* Cardset | [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker)’s mana ability cannot be activated during the mana ability step in paying a cost for a spell or ability.
* Cardset | Cards that ask a player to choose X targets, such as [Glimpse the Sun God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God), briefly indicate incorrectly that X is equal to zero when the last potential target is chosen before moving on to the cost payment step.
* Cardset | [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) incorrectly allows a player to redirect spells or abilities to the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), even if it’s no longer on the battlefield.
* Cardset | [The Great Aurora](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Great+Aurora) incorrectly allows tokens shuffled into a player's library to be drawn later in resolving the spell.

 


**Client**


 


* Collection | Rapidly checking and unchecking filters for a deck or binder with one or more cards that have multiple types such as “artifact creature” or “artifact land” can cause a crash.

Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
======================================


 


We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature.
   | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters.
   |
| Duel Scene | Cards that tutor for multiple cards at once don’t show the tutored cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. | The cards are properly identified in the game log.
   |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. | You must start by ordering blockers for the left most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right.
   |
| Duel Scene | Graveyard order appears incorrectly in expanded or undocked views.
   | Keeping the graveyard in small, undocked “preview” (default) window will display order correctly for cards like [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) and [Sphinx’s Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%E2%80%99s+Tutelage).
   |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error.
   | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Collection | Rapidly checking and unchecking filters for a deck or binder with a multi-type card (for example, [Hangarback Walker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) is an artifact and a creature) can cause a crash. | This crash will not occur if you use the filters at a normal speed. |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step.
   | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. |
| Sideboard Issues:
  
 Duel Scene | Black game screen after sideboarding. 
 and
 Sideboard | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when Sideboarding. | These issues seem to be tied to the player's computer going to sleep during deckbuilding. Making it so that your computer does not go into hibernation may alleviate these issues if you're experiencing them.
   |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results.
   | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues.
   |
| Trade | If you open a booster pack that is in your active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade.
   | Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.

Known Issues List
=================



The following are a list of known issues on *Magic Online*. Our goal with the known issues list is to give players insight into what we're working on, as well as helping players avoid problematic bugs and performance issues.


Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of known issues, simply the ones that we feel players are most likely to encounter. These issues are also not sorted in any particular order, aside from their category. While the list below is not sorted by priority or projected fix date, bugs and performance issues listed as "scheduled" have a scheduled fix in the near future—this status is subject to change.

| Cardset | Cards that ask a player to choose X targets, such as [Glimpse the Sun God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God), briefly indicate incorrectly that X is equal to zero when the last potential target is chosen before moving on to the cost payment step.  |

| Cardset | [Lightning Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm)'s activated ability will sometimes let the wrong player change the target.

| Cardset | [The Chain Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) does not allow Planeswalkers that enter the battlefield after activating [The Chain Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) to use their abilities twice. |
| Cardset | [The Great Aurora](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Great+Aurora) incorrectly allows tokens shuffled into a player's library to be drawn later in resolving the spell. |

| Duel Scene | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. |
| Duel Scene | Cards that tutor for multiple cards at once don’t show the tutored cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. These cards are properly identified in the game log. |
| Duel Scene | Colorless mana autoconsumed before special mana (e.g. from [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) and [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)). |
| Duel Scene | Spells with multiple targets (such as [Silumgar's Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command), [Agony Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), etc.) sometimes lack visual indicators to show what is happening to each target.  |
| Duel Scene | Trying to attach equipment to creatures that do not meet the equipment's requirement incorrectly depletes mana pool. |
| Duel Scene | Cards that put multiple cards into the graveyard at once (e.g. [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) or [Sphinx's Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage)), the cards appear in the wrong order. This is a display error only.  |
| Duel Scene | When you play a Ravnica shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before you decide whether to pay 2 life. |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. |
| Duel Scene | The prompt text where the card states "Choose up to X target... X is currently [#]." States 'zero' when the last valid target is clicked.  |
| Duel Scene | When affects like [Parallax Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) and [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) end and creatures return to the battlefield, if one of those creatures was a [Containment Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) then all other creatures are Exiled.  |
| Duel Scene | When colorless mana is added to a player's mana pool as a result of a creature dying in combat (e.g. [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), [Su-chi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-chi)), the user is unable to spend that mana if no stop is set. |
| General | When the "No Possible Play: Yield All" function is active, tapping [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) when it's the only land you control will automatically end your turn even if you can spend the mana created.  |

| Cardset | The promo version of [Mizzium Meddler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler) made its way to *Magic Online* without a set symbol. The set symbol will be added with the launch of *Battle for Zendikar*. |
