![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a898.jpg)Hans-Joachim Höh is a German player with a previous best of a 32nd finish at GP Antwerp. He's also been on the tour a couple of times without much success. Rob McKeon is an experienced Irish player who's played on the tour a lot but without finding much success. With 31 pts each both are just two wins away from the top 8.

Höh is running Rebels while McKeon is playing the [Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) combo deck.

McKeon thought for a long time about keeping his starting hand before deciding to do so. Höh came out of the blocks quickly with turn 1 sergeant, turn 2 [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder) and then a [True Believer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True+Believer) and [Mother of Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) on turn 3.

McKeon cast [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) for a [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) then tried to cast [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), forgetting about the [True Believer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True+Believer)'s ability.

"You can look for [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage)s in your own hand" – Höh.

"Maybe I should have looked at the new set" – McKeon.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a900.jpg)A bit fazed McKeon cast Cloud of Fairies to try and soak up the extra mana but tapped too many and mana-burned anyway.

Höh forced him into a situation where he needed to go off or die. McKeon [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed for [Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) but he needed to draw a forest because he was only down to 1 life.

"Yep, I die to mana-burn," McKeon said packing up his cards for game 2.

Höh 1-0 McKeon

McKeon went first and had to mulligan. He managed a quick turn 1 [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and followed it with a [Hickory Woodlot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hickory+Woodlot).

Höh opened with a [Ramosian Sergeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramosian+Sergeant) and then a [Seal of Cleansing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Cleansing) to make things awkward for the Irishman. A [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder) was added to the assault.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a899.jpg)McKeon [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed end of turn, fetching a [Cavern Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy). He then complicated things for the German by casting a [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed).

Höh [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed in his turn and shuffled the unwanted cards back into the deck with a [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand). He didn't find anything useful, tapping out to make [Divine Sacrament](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Sacrament).

The way seemed clear for McKeon to drop [Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) and go off. Höh wasn't done though. McKeon dropped [Wirewood Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage) but in response to the [Cavern Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy) coming in Höh used the [Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) to bring in a [Gilded Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) and steal the Savage. McKeon had a second Savage though and it looked like the game would get very complicated. But the German had managed to draw a second [Gilded Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) off the stolen Savage and suddenly McKeon's combo was all busted up as both [Wirewood Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage)s were on the wrong side of the table. [Parallax Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) appeared to whip away the Drakes and then it was all over for the Irishman.

**Final Result:** Hans-Joachim Höh beat Rob McKeon 2-0
