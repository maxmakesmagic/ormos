There was much good-natured laughter as the teams waited to start the draft.


Poor Shark (left side of table): Masahiko Morita, Tomomi Otsuka, Masahiro Kuroda


Voice of Soul (right side of table): Takao Higaki, Tadayoshi Komiya, Tsuyoshi Douyama


Komiya opened the firs tpack and immediately signalled his intentions by putting his hand over the [Rout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rout). Douyama was pleased as well to get a [Power Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Armor). Adding a [Sunscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Apprentice) and a [Quirion Trailblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Trailblazer) in the pack, he seemed okay with the defensive strategy implied in his first-pick [Teferi's Moat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Moat) from the second pack.


Morita's pack, the first one that gave the first three cards all to one team, provided a [Shackles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shackles), [Plague Spores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Spores), and [Exotic Curse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exotic+Curse). A powerful [Sleeper's Robe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleeper%27s+Robe) made it all the way around to Douyama, who now seemed to be blue-white-black.


Otsuka's pack gave her a [Soul Burn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Burn) and Kuroda a [Thornscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Apprentice), with a [Vicious Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Kavu) going to Higaki, who was working on a red-green deck to go along with Komiya's black-blue-white and Douyama's red-green-white.


When Morita opened his second *Invasion* pack (that fed directly into his team), he was happy to take a Treva and give Otsuka an [Annihilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annihilate). Even Kuroda was happy with his third-pick [Benalish Trapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Trapper).


In the *Planeshift* packs, there were plenty of [Magma Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Burst)s and [Rushing River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rushing+River)s to go around. Morita's pack gave his team a [Lava Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Zombie), [Phyrexian Scuta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Scuta), and [Hobble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hobble); Otsuka's pack gave her team the choice of giving her red-black deck [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) or a [Magma Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Burst); they went with the Burst after a certain amount of nonverbal discussion.
