To hold you over during **magicthegathering.com’s** holiday break (remember, the site goes into “Best Of” mode next week), today we drop upon you a pile of Arcana-licious presents. You need only tear through their wrapping, then proceed straightaway with the dancing about the room in your footie pajamas.

Because today we unleash a little *Planar Chaos*.

Unwrap.

It’s generally rectangular except for a flap sticking up on one side, it’s heavy for its size, it doesn’t “shake,” it’s—a display of *Planar Chaos* theme decks!

Ooh, presents are fun. Let’s delve deeper. Let’s rip out one of those theme decks and destroy some cellophane. Unwrap.

*Woot*. It appears to be some sort of large, flying lizard. Should we wait and let our siblings get a turn to open something? It’s the holidays, after all. That would be the mature, giving thing to—NO! *Give us another!* Unwrap!

Huh. Well. Is that…? Nevermind, no time to speculate! Another! Unwrap!

Mono-blue, eh? Ixidor? And what’s the art there… hmm. Nevermind, there’s one more present in the box! Gleemax will keep track of things for thank-you notes later! Onward! Unwrap!

There’s wrapping paper all over the living room and it’s time for a little holiday music and some late breakfast. Bask a little in your post-holiday wreckage and circle [January 20-21, 2007](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) a few hundred times on your calendar. *Planar Chaos* is about to reign.

*Planar Chaos* products (including these theme decks) hit shelves February 2, 2007.
