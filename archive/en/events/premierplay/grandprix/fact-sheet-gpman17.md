FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
--------------------



* [Format](#-tabs-1)
* [Structure](#-tabs-2)
* [Judges & Notes](#-tabs-3)

* [Standard Constructed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-formats-magic-gathering)
* Deck lists are required
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* All players with an X-3-0 record (or better) advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**


Judges interested in applying for the event should do so using the [Judge Center](http://apps.magicjudges.org/).

In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

Byes
----


Grand Prix tournament byes can be earned either through a player's yearly [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/Information) total or by winning a [Grand Prix Trial](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-trials-event-types-events).


Byes earned through Planeswalker Points are calculated using the Planeswalker Point totals from all reported events as of the Tuesday immediately before the Grand Prix. Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix.


Winners of a Grand Prix Trial tournament are awarded two byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds. For complete information about Grand Prix byes and their corresponding competitive season, please check the [*Magic: The Gathering* Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents/244).


#### Third Round Byes
