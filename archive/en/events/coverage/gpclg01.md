2001 Grand Prix Cologne Coverage
================================












2001 Grand Prix Cologne Coverage
--------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gp_lg.gif)Jim Herold has won Grand Prix Cologne, defeating Antoine Ruel, 2-0, in the finals. This is Herold's third Grand Prix victory; he won Frankfurt with Team III Heroes, and he won Grand Prix Oslo by himself. He joins Kai Budde, Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz, and Jon Finkel as the only wniners of three. Finkel and O'Mahoney-Schwartz both won Grand Prix St. Louis with Team Antarctica to go along with their individual wins (Rio and Boston for Finkel; Madrid and Zurich for O'Mahoney-Schwartz). The only person with three individual Grand Prix wins is Kai Budde (Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Vienna). Ruel's second-place finish matches his brother Olivier's finish in Valencia two weeks ago. The last time two brothers finished in the same spot in the Top 8 of consecutive Grand Prix was . . . last month, when Dan O'Mahoney-Schwartz finished fourth in Grand Prix Amsterdam the week after his brother Steve got fourth in New Orleans.
