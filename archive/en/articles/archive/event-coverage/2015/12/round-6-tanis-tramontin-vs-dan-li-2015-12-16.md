At table 1, Tanis Tramontin faced off against Dan Li. Both players were fairly young and located nearby, Dan being a local and Tanis coming in from Warren, Michigan. Dan is a seasoned player, though he doesn't compete in a lot of high-level tournaments. Travis just came off of a victory in a forty person Standard tournament, as had not lost a game coming into this match.


Tanis is playing White Weenie matched against Dan's Stompy. This matchup heavily favors the white deck, 


Game 1


Tanis led off with turns one and two Mothers of Runes, severely limiting Dan's options. Dan played out a River Boa and follows it up with Rancor, hoping to get some breakthrough damage in. In the meantime, Tanis has cast a Defiant Falcon and searched for a Lin Sivvi. Dan cast a Troll, but the game was already looking like an uphill battle. Tramontin opted to cast a Glorious Anthem, rather than double search - a play that allowed him to go on the offensive. Li Rancored the Troll and attacked, but Tanis just searched out a Steadfast Guard for the block. Li Giant Growthed a few points through, but the Guard was protected by the Mother. Dan cast a second River Boa and Tanis took advantage, playing a Masticore and shooting down the Boa. Dan deliberated, but eventually paid the alternate cost on Invigorate to keep his creature alive. Even the extra creature and a fresh cast Pouncing Jaguar couldn't save Li, who was beaten on the next turn by a Defiant Falcon, Steadfast Guard and Masticore, the last two given protection from green. 


Tramontin 1, Li 0


Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/AMCHAMP00/Images/b13.JPG)Dan drew his seven cards and tossed them on the table, upset. He quickly mulliganed. His second hand was somewhat better. He opened with a Treetop Village. Tanis again dropped a first turn Mother, eliciting a groan from Dan. Li cast a Boa, which was very solid, until Tramontin followed the Mother with a Longbow Archer, effectively halting the potential offense. Dan used a Tangle Wire to tap Tanis out, but Tanis just played another Plains and cast a Ramosian Sergeant. Dan played another Village and showed a little offensive muscle. Tanis used the chance to counterattack and play out a Steadfast Guard. The Wire faded away and Li dropped his coup de gras: Masticore. Tanis looked a little bothered, shifting his cards back and forth, then proceeded to draw and play Topple, must to the consternating of Li. Dan then dropped a Troll and an Orangutan to help defend, but it was too late. Tramontin play the Parallax Wave he'd been holding and continued his assault. Once he added a Crusade to the mix, Li scooped.


Tramontin defeats Li, 2-0.
