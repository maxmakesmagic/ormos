Welcome to Delphi 2
===================


There are a few basic premises involved in taking the second installment of the Delphi Test series. This test is not timed-- it is recommended you review the entire test again after completing it but before attempting to score the test. Always read the question and answers carefully. It is recommended that Delphi be taken once without assistance and then repeated with a copy of the Comprehensive Rules available.


**Extra Special Note:** Unless a question states otherwise, you may assume that all players have a sufficient amount of mana to pay whatever costs are necessary. No permanents are in play other than the permanents specified in each question. Creatures with their characteristics listed parenthetically in a test question have no additional abilities.


Here is some shorthand as well as the official wording for several abilities that appear in the test. You may wish to refer back here during the test:  

B = one Black mana  

U = one Blue mana  

G = one Green mana  

R = one Red mana  

W = one White mana  

T = Tap  

Buyback X #(If you pay an additional X as you play this spell, put it into your hand instead of your graveyard as part of the spell's resolution.)#  

Cycling 2 #(You may pay 2 and discard this card from your hand to draw a card. Play this ability any time you could play an instant.)#  

Echo #(At the beginning of your next upkeep after this permanent comes under your control, sacrifice it unless you pay its mana cost.)#  

Fading X #(This artifact comes into play with X fade counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from it. If you can't, sacrifice it.)#  

Haste #(This creature may attack and T the turn it comes under your control.)#

> **a)** Yes  
> **b)** No

 Look at target opponent's hand and choose a noncreature, nonland card from it. That player discards that card.


Misdirection (3UU, Instant)

 Target spell with a single target targets another target instead.



> **a)** Yes

Shower of Sparks (R, Instant)

Worship (3W, Enchantment)  

 Damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead if you control a creature.



> **a)** Yes  
> **b)** No
13. Michelle attacks with a Fresh Volunteers (W1, Creature- Rebel, 2/2). After he declines to block, Russell activates his Circle of Protection: White choosing the Fresh Volunteers when the ability resolves. Before putting damage on the stack, Michelle uses an Ashnod's Transmogrant targeting the Fresh Volunteers. Will the shield prevent the Fresh Volunteers' combat damage?


Ashnod's Transmogrant (1, Artifact)

14. Russell controls a Phyrexian War Beast, a Cathodion, an Ashnod's Altar, and one land, which is an untapped Forest. He sacrifices the Cathodion to his Ashnod's Altar. If Michelle plays Diabolic Edict targeting Russell when she receives priority, will Russell have enough mana to play the only green card in his hand, a Vine Dryad, and preserve his Phyrexian War Beast?


Ashnod's Altar (3, Artifact)  

 Sacrifice a creature: Add two colorless mana to your mana pool.

 When Phyrexian War Beast leaves play, sacrifice a land and Phyrexian War Beast deals 1 damage to you.


Vine Dryad (3G, Creature- Dryad, 1/3)  

 Forestwalk  

 You may play Vine Dryad any time you could play an instant.  

 You may remove a green card in your hand from the game instead of paying Vine Dryad's mana cost.



> 
> **a)** No. Ashnod's Altar has a mana ability and cannot be responded to, but the Cathodion's ability is a triggered ability that uses the stack. Michelle has responded to the Cathodion's ability, so Russell doesn't yet have the last point of mana required to play his Vine Dryad.
> 
> 
> **b)** No. The Ashnod's Altar has a normal activated ability, and the Cathodion's ability is a triggered ability. So Russell doesn't get the mana from either in time to play the Vine Dryad before the Diabolic Edict resolves.
> 
> 
> **c)** No. Once Russell has passed priority to Michelle he will not receive priority again until the stack is empty.
> 
> 
> **d)** Yes. Ashnod's Altar has a normal activated ability that goes onto the stack. Cathodion's ability is a mana ability, so it resolves immediately. Michelle has responded to the Ashnod's Altar's ability, but Russell has already received the 3 mana from Cathodion with which he can play the Vine Dryad.
> 
> 
> **e)** Yes. Abilities which produce mana are mana abilities and don't use the stack. By the time Michelle can respond, Russell has already received the mana from both of the abilities, and he can afford to play his Vine Dryad.
> 
> 
>
15. With an Opalescence in play, Michelle attacks Russell with her Wild Jhovall (R3, Creature- Cat, 3/3). Russell uses a Soul Sculptor targeting the Wild Jhovall prior to blocking. How does combat conclude?


Opalescence (2WW, Enchantment)  

 Each other global enchantment is a creature with power and toughness each equal to its converted mana cost. It's still an enchantment.


Soul Sculptor (2W, Creature- Townsfolk, 1/1)  

 1W, T: Target creature becomes an enchantment and loses all abilities until a player plays a creature spell.



> 
> **a)** Turning creatures into enchantments removes them from combat, so the Wild Jhovall won't deal any combat damage.
> 
> 
> **b)** The Soul Sculptor turned the Wild Jhovall into an enchantment. It is now an attacking enchantment that can't deal damage.
> 
> 
> **c)** The Soul Sculptor turned the Wild Jhovall into an enchantment. It is now an attacking enchantment that deals three damage like a normal creature due to its last known characteristics.
> 
> 
> **d)** As the Soul Sculptor turned the Wild Jhovall into an enchantment, it would have been removed from combat had it not been for the Opalescence. The Wild Jhovall is still attacking and will deal four damage.
> 
> 
> **e)** The Soul Sculptor turned the Wild Jhovall into an enchantment, but Opalescence immediately turned it back into a creature. For a moment it wasn't a creature, but the state based effect that removes creatures from combat didn't get checked at that time. The Wild Jhovall is still attacking and will deal four damage.
> 
> 
>
16. Michelle plays a Shock, targeting Russell's River Boa. Russell responds by playing the regeneration ability of the River Boa, and the regeneration shield resolves. Michelle then plays her Hurr Jackal's ability targeting the River Boa, and that ability resolves. Michelle then plays a Debt of Loyalty targeting the River Boa, and it resolves. Finally the Shock resolves. What happens?


Debt of Loyalty (1WW, Instant) Regenerate target creature. You gain control of that creature if it regenerates this way this turn.


Hurr Jackal (R, Creature- Jackal, 1/1) T: Target creature can't be regenerated this turn.


River Boa (1G, Creature- Snake, 2/1) Islandwalk G: Regenerate River Boa.


Shock (R, Instant) Shock deals 2 damage to target creature or player.



> 
> **a)** The River Boa can't regenerate. It is put into the graveyard during the check for state based effects.
> 
> 
> **b)** The ability of the Hurr Jackal overrides the regeneration shield of the River Boa. The only shield left is from the Debt of Loyalty. The River Boa regenerates, and Michelle gains control of the River Boa.
> 
> 
> **c)** The ability of the Hurr Jackal overrides the regeneration shield of the Debt of Loyalty. The only shield left is from the River Boa. The River Boa regenerates, and Russell maintains control of the River Boa.
> 
> 
> **d)** Since Russell has control of the creature, he can decide which shield to apply first. He can choose apply the shield from Debt of Loyalty first, which will be neutralized by the Hurr Jackal ability. Then he can apply the shield from the River Boa itself and regenerate the River Boa.
> 
> 
> **e)** Since Russell has control of the creature, he can decide which shield to apply first. Regardless of which regeneration effect he applies first, the Hurr Jackal overrides regeneration effects. However, Debts of Loyalty's side effect still happens, and Michelle gains control of the River Boa.
> 
> 
>
17. Russell activates his Predator, Flagship's destroy ability targeting Michelle's Voice of Truth. In response, Michelle uses her Distorting Lens to make the Predator, Flagship white. The ability of the Distorting Lens resolves. Russell then plays Disenchant targeting the Predator, Flagship. The Disenchant destroys the Predator, Flagship, then what happens?


Disenchant (1W, Instant)  

 Destroy target artifact or enchantment.


Distorting Lens (2, Artifact)  

 T: Target permanent becomes the color of your choice until end of turn.


Predator, Flagship (5, Legendary Artifact)  

 2: Target creature gains flying until end of turn.  

 5, T: Destroy target creature with flying.


Voice of Truth (3W, Creature- Angel, 2/2)  

 Flying, protection from white



> 
> **a)** On resolution, the destroy ability checks the color of the Predator, Flagship and sees that it is in the graveyard and thereby unaffected by Distorting Lens. The destroy effect is no longer white, and the Voice of Truth is destroyed.
> 
> 
> **b)** Even though the Predator, Flagship was white when it left play, the ability resolving is colorless. The Voice of Truth is destroyed.
> 
> 
> **c)** The Predator, Flagship was white when it left play, so the last known color was white. However, because the Predator, Flagship was also an artifact, the Voice of Truth is still destroyed.
> 
> 
> **d)** The Voice of Truth had already been successfully targeted when the Distorting Lens ability resolved. Therefore, the Voice of Truth will be destroyed even though the destroy ability is white on resolution.
> 
> 
> **e)** The Predator, Flagship was white when it left play, so its last known color was white, and the destroy ability is countered because of the protection from white.
> 
> 
>
18. Russell controls an Abundance. Michelle controls a Field of Dreams. Russell targets himself with and resolves a Stroke of Genius for five. How is this resolution handled?


Abundance (2GG, Enchantment)  

 If you would draw a card, you may instead choose land or nonland and reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a card of the chosen kind. Put that card into your hand and put all other cards revealed this way on the bottom of your library in any order.


Field of Dreams (U, Enchant World)  

 Players play with the top card of their libraries revealed.


Stroke of Genius (X2U, Instant)  

 Target player draws X cards.



> 
> **a)** Before he manipulates any cards, Russell must say which of the draws he will replace with the Abundance ability. He doesn't get to see the top card of his library before any of the actions while resolving the Stroke of Genius.
> 
> 
> **b)** Before he manipulates any cards, Russell must say which of the draws he will replace with the Abundance ability. He does get to see the top card of his library before any of the actions while resolving the Stroke of Genius.
> 
> 
> **c)** Russell may decide before each draw if he wants to replace it with Abundance, but he won't know what the top card of his library is when he decides.
> 
> 
> **d)** Russell may decide before each draw if he wants to replace it with Abundance, and he does get to see the top card of his library before deciding.
> 
> 
> **e)** Russell must decide to either replace all draws with Abundance or none at all when he starts resolving the Stroke of Genius.
> 
> 
>
19. Michelle controls a Seal of Cleansing and an Opalescence. Russell targets the Seal of Cleansing with a Desert Twister. Michelle plays a Reverent Mantra in response. When the Reverent Mantra resolves, Michelle chooses green. Before the Desert Twister resolves, Russell plays a Disenchant targeting the Opalescence. The Opalescence and Disenchant are put into their graveyards. What happens when the Desert Twister attempts to resolve?


Desert Twister (4GG, Sorcery)  

 Destroy target permanent.


Disenchant (1W, Instant) Destroy target artifact or enchantment.


Opalescence (2WW, Enchantment) Each other global enchantment is a creature with power and toughness each equal to its converted mana cost. It's still an enchantment.


Reverent Mantra (3W, Instant) You may remove a white card in your hand from the game instead of paying Reverent Mantra's mana cost. All creatures gain protection from the color of your choice until end of turn.


Seal of Cleansing (1W, Enchantment) Sacrifice Seal of Cleansing: Destroy target artifact or enchantment.



> 
> **a)** The Desert Twister originally targeted a creature. Because the Seal of Cleansing is now just an enchantment, the Desert Twister is countered on resolution.
> 
> 
> **b)** The Desert Twister targets an enchantment that has protection from green. The Desert Twister will be countered on resolution.
> 
> 
> **c)** Reverent Mantra can only affect creatures. The Seal of Cleansing is no longer a creature. The Desert Twister destroys the Seal of Cleansing.
> 
> 
> **d)** Reverent Mantra still applies to the Seal of Cleansing, because it has already resolved. However, Seal of Cleansing isn't a creature, so it can't have protection from green. The Desert Twister destroys the Seal of Cleansing.
> 
> 
> **e)** The Desert Twister checked the legality of its target at the time it was announced and doesn't do so a second time. Therefore, the Desert Twister destroys the Seal of Cleansing.
> 
> 
>
20. Michelle plays a Plow Under targeting two of Russell's lands. What happens when the Plow Under resolves?


Plow Under (3GG, Sorcery)  

 Put two target lands on top of their owner's library.



> 
> **a)** Michelle can put 0, 1, or 2 of the targeted lands on top of Russell's library. She chooses the order.
> 
> 
> **b)** Michelle can put 0, 1, or 2 of the targeted lands on top of Russell's library. He chooses the order.
> 
> 
> **c)** Michelle must put both lands on top of Russell's library starting with the most recently played land.
> 
> 
> **d)** Michelle must put both lands on top of Russell's library, and she chooses the order.
> 
> 
> **e)** Michelle must put both lands on top of Russell's library, and he chooses the order.
> 
> 
>
21. Michelle controls an Angelic Chorus, a Kyren Negotiations, and a Castle. Michelle plays and resolves a Fresh Volunteers (W1, Creature- Rebel, 2/2) triggering the Angelic Chorus. After Michelle has put the Angelic Chorus ability on the stack, Russell targets the Fresh Volunteers with a Terror. Michelle plays the ability of Kyren Negotiations, tapping the Fresh Volunteers and targeting Russell. Then the Terror resolves and destroys the Fresh Volunteers. What happens when the Angelic Chorus ability resolves?


Angelic Chorus (3WW, Enchantment)  

 Whenever a creature comes into play under your control, you gain life equal to its toughness.


Castle (3W, Enchantment)  

 Untapped creatures you control get +0/+2.


Kyren Negotiations (2RR, Enchantment)  

 Tap an untapped creature you control: Kyren Negotiations deals 1 damage to target player.


Terror (1B, Instant)  

 Destroy target nonartifact, nonblack creature. It can't be regenerated.



> 
> **a)** The Angelic Chorus ability checks for the Fresh Volunteers' toughness, but the Fresh Volunteers is no longer in play. Michelle gains no life.
> 
> 
> **b)** The Fresh Volunteers' toughness was two when it left play. Michelle gains two life.
> 
> 
> **c)** The Fresh Volunteers' toughness was four when it left play. Michelle gains four life.
> 
> 
> **d)** The Fresh Volunteers' toughness was two when it came into play. Michelle gains two life.

22. Russell plays a Cannibalize, choosing to remove a creature he controls from the game, and put two +1/+1 counters on a second creature he controls. Michelle destroys the second creature in response. Russell plays a Power Sink for zero targeting his Cannibalize. When it resolves, can the Power Sink counter the Cannibalize?


Cannibalize (1B, Sorcery)  

 Choose a player and two target creatures controlled by that player. You remove one from the game and put two +1/+1 counters on the other.


Power Sink (XU, Instant)  

 Counter target spell unless its controller pays X. If he or she doesn't, that player taps all lands with mana abilities he or she controls and empties his or her mana pool.



> 
> **a)** Yes. Russell can choose to not pay zero. The Cannibalize will be countered and Russell must tap all his lands with mana abilities.
> 
> 
> **b)** Yes. Russell can choose to not pay zero. The Cannibalize will be countered and Russell will not tap all his lands with mana abilities.
>
