What Is the *Magic Online* Bug Blog?


While the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) is simply that—a running list of issues we expect players to encounter most often—this accompanying “Bug Blog” is the list’s companion. Here you’ll find updates regarding emergent new issues, details around issue statuses when applicable, known issue workarounds, and a running tally of Known Issues List updates. The Bug Blog will be updated each Thursday, in conjunction with the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) on the same day.

**Known Issues List Updates**


We're currently prioritizing what fixes will be going into our next big deployment. Nothing new to report this week aside from a new known issue surfacing. Refer to the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) to see the fixes that were applied to the *Magic Online* client during the Wednesday, December 3 downtime.


**Newly Added Known Issues as of Thursday, December 11**


**Game Play**



* General | Destroying a [Song of the Dryads](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Song+of+the+Dryads) enchanted control-change Aura doesn't cause control of the creature to revert back to its owner


**Fixed during the Wednesday, December 3 *Magic Online* Client Update**


**Game Play**



* C14 | Artifact creature tokens created by C14 cards show no art when zoomed or in the preview pane
* C14 | [Nahiri, the Lithomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Lithomancer)'s first ability attaches the equipment to previous tokens if they exist
* C14 | Offerings display blue text identifying a chosen opponent before it is chosen. The cards function correctly.
* C14 | [Song of the Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Song+of+the+Dryad) enchanting another Aura appears incorrectly. The card functions correctly.
* General | A copy of a spell that divides damage among multiple targets doesn't display the distribution among the copy's targets
* General | [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum)'s resolution can crash the game, causing it to restart
* General | Lands in M15 frames that produce mana of two differnet colors have the wrong background colors in the rules text box
* General | [Trinisphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere)'s effect does not apply to spells with X in the mana cost
* General | Various library searching cards hang the game if there is nothing legal to find in the library


**Client**



* Collection | Rarity filter works inconsistently
* Collection | Selecting different versions of a card and using the context menu to "Add 1 to Deck" only adds one card, not one of each version
* Collection | Sorting columns in list view prevents quantity from being displayed correctly. Changing to card view will show correct quantities.
* Duel Scene | The window for [Thoughtsieze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtsieze) (and other spells or effects that allow selection from a subset of revealed cards) is not sized correctly to show all cards. Scrolling, resizing the window, or checking the game log will allow players to see all the cards revealed.
* Event Details | Row color does not always update to show completed matches correctly
* Events | Decks saved during limited deck building occasionally fail to load and deliver a "No decks available matching your pool" message
* Events | In limited deckbuilding, decks sometimes fail to show all cards which can prevent deck submission
* Events | Occasionally cards can become visually duplicated in your sideboard and prevent deck submission
* Events | Scheduled events that are not four rounds show up as Daily (4-round) in the Play Lobby


**Server**



* Limited Deckbuilding | Submit button is greyed out even though deck is legal
* Play Lobby | Legacy Cube is just named "Cube"


 



**Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues**



We're hard at work on whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly |
| General | Players can experience memory leaks in some situations | Restarting the client can temporarily resolve these issues |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues |

**Server**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem |
