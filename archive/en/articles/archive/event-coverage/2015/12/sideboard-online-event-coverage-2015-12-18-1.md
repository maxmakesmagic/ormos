**U.S. Nationals 1999 Reports**

Round 1 Feature Match
---------------------



**Casey McCarrel vs Nate Clarke** 


 ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/USNAT99/images/R1McCarrelClarke.JPG)Game 
 1: McCarrel, playing an agressive GR deck, won the coin flip, but 
 chose to draw first. Clarke elected to keep an opening hand of six 
 Plains and an Opal Titan. After trading land drops for the first 
 few turns, McCarrel dropped a Titania's Chosen. 
 

 On Clarke's fourth turn, he played the Titan, prompting McCarrel 
 to ask "What does that thing do?" After Clarke told him, he calmly 
 untapped, cast Multani's decree and attacked with his 2/2 Chosen. 
 

 As Clarke continued to draw and drop more land, McCarrel dropped 
 a number of fat creatures. Clarke feebly tried to hold down the 
 fort with Capashen Knight and Sustainer of the Realm, and was even 
 able to kill off McCarrel's Cradle Guard when he cast a Congregate, 
 but it was to no avail as McCarrel showed Clarke the Lava Axe in 
 his hand, causing Clarke to scoop. 
 

 Game 2 started quite differently with Clarke, who chose to play 
 first droppinga Sanctum Custodian on his third turn. After McCarrel 
 once again plays a third turn Chosen, Clarke solidified his ground 
 defence with a Capashen Knight and a Field Surgeon. McCarrel plays 
 a Yavamays Elder on his turn, but is unable to drop a land, and 
 when Clarke plays the protection from green Voice of Duty on turn 
 5, it looks like its all but over. 
 

 After watching the PT points leader drop a Cradle Guard, Clarke 
 atacked for 2 with the Voice and plays Sustainer of the Realm, another 
 good defensive creature. After McCarrel paid for the Guard, Clarke 
 went on the offensive with both fliers, taking McCarrel to 13. 
 

 McCarrel dropped Rancor on his Elder, making his Chosen bigger, 
 then sacrificed the Elder to get some much needed land. The next 
 turn, in an attempt to stop the Sustainer from attacking, McCarrel 
 cast Plated Spider, but seemed to have no way of stopping the Voice. 
 

 After Clarke attacked with the Voice taking McCarrel down to 7, 
 McCarrel attacked with the 9/7 Chosen. Clarke made the mistake of 
 block with his Wall of Glare and tapping most of his creatures to 
 prevent damage before McCarrel assigns trample dammage, and McCarrel 
 took advantage, Heat Raying the Voice. 
 

 A few turns later, McCarrel dropped a Crosswinds, which Clarke 
 never drew a solution to. Despite total board control, Clarke had 
 no way of breaking through, and they eventually ran out of time, 
 with McCarrel having one card left in his library. 
 

 Final tally: McCarrel 1, Clarke 0
