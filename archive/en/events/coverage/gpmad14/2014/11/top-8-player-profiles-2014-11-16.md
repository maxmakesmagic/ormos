### Andrew Devine


**Age:** 29  
**Hometown:** Leeds, UK  
**Occupation:** Joiner  
**Clan:** Abzan


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

I made it into the British team for the 2013 World *Magic* Cup. I won all 3 Two-Headed Giant Sealed Events in the *Return to Ravnica* block.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Melira Pod - for me, it's the best choice to leverage playskill and experience. I must have podded in around 1,000 matches!


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

The list is too tight; every card in my main and sideboard was valuable at some point. There may be some upgrades on cards, but they would be in the same vein.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod)

### Marcio Alexandre Pinto de Carvalho


**Age:** Too old! :-(  
**Hometown:** Portugal, Lisbon  
**Occupation:** "Sushilover"  
**Clan:** Abzan, obviously.


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Thanks to today's result, I'm back to one-upping Willy Edel in Grand Prix Top 8 appearances! *(Editor's note: We're not quite sure that's the case, both advanced to the Top 8 seven times according to the official website.)*


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

I love Junk-like decks and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) seemed like too strong an addition to ignore it. It pushed it over the top in my opinion. #edelgenius


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

I would maybe play a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) instead of a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom).


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)

### Immanuel Gerschenson


**Age:** 21  
**Hometown:** Vienna, Austria  
**Occupation:** Student

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

$%&/-


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

RUG Delver (splashing for [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)). Patrick Tomelitsch and Bernhard Lehner convinced me to play the deck, it had a lot of good testing results.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

I would cut [Dragon's Claw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Claw) from the board; it's simply too slow.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)!

### Kevin Grove


**Age:** 29  
**Hometown:** Amsterdam, Netherlands  
**Occupation:** Product Manager  
**Clan:** Abzan


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

GP Brighton Top 8 back in 2009. National Champion 2009.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Angelpod. I have been playing Pod for years and it is very customizable, so no matter the metagame, it's always a viable contender.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

I don't know; I'll keep copying the last 4-0 from the *Magic Online* Daily Events.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  

Pod

**Occupation:** Leiden, the Netherlands  
**Clan:** Temur

[Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) with [Summoning Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap), because it can play both [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) and [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods).


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

None, I would just adept it to the respective expected metagame for the event.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) in the main deck and [Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boil) in my sideboard.

**Hometown:** Berlin, Germany  
**Occupation:** Data Scientist  
**Clan:** Temur


 

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**  

Some PTQ Wins and mostly coming close to the Top 8 at the Grand Prix.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Scapeshift; besides Delver, I like almost every match-up and even Delver feels very beatable with it.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

None, I really liked the list.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) and the main deck [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)s.

**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Mono-White Life Gain - I have a lot of experience with the deck. It has a lot of good match-ups against all the decks that can't deal infinite damage.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

None
