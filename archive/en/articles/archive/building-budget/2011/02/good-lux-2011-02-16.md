As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






I spent a few hours looking through [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) this past weekend. A lot of readers asked to see a budget Standard deck this week. I wanted to build a deck that had game against one of the most important cards in Standard, [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). 

It may seem strange that I'm targeting [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), but it is quickly becoming the most impressive threat in the format. Last weekend, at [Pro Tour Paris](/en/events/coverage/stark-flies-high-planeswalkers-paris), [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) was played as a four-of in both aggressive and controlling decks. Having access to either [Sword of Body and Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Body+and+Mind) or, more importantly, [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) makes the situation very difficult for any non-red opponent. As a bonus, you're playing white. So if your opponent happens to be playing red, they're in a lot of trouble after you sideboard.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab130_stoneforge.jpg)  
Removal isn't the answer to a card like [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). A savvy Equipment-slinger won't waste their mana trying to equip their sword into an untapped opponent; they will just cast more creatures and attack, forcing you to use your removal spells prematurely or to tap out for a defensive measure on your own turn. 

The best answer I was able to find was [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet). [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) accomplishes everything you need it to. Playing the card makes it very difficult for your opponent to profitably equip something. Be conservative with your charge counters; wait for your opponent to enter the combat step and only tap something if it's equipped or if it's a [six-mana mythic rare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Btitan%5D&set=%5B%22Magic+2011%22%5D) from ***Magic** 2011*. [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) is especially strong because it's a permanent. Instant-speed removal demands that we leave our mana untapped. Leaving up mana for Instant-speed removal gives our opponent an opportunity to gain a small advantage by playing additional [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s or [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)s. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab130_tumble3.jpg)  
Standard is not one dimensional, though. Players can slap down planeswalkers and beat you no matter how many [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s you have on the battlefield. [Lux Cannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) was always a bomb in Limited. Some decks just didn't have a way to kill it. In Standard, most decks have little to no way to interact with the four-mana artifact. This seemed like a strong way to interact with planeswalkers. 

I've already got two artifacts that use charge counters, so this could be the perfect opportunity to use proliferate to our advantage. [Throne of Geth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth) combos nicely with [Ichor Wellspring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichor+Wellspring) and [Spine of Ish Sah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah). The proliferate mechanic is very powerful if we have multiple copies of [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) and/or [Lux Cannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) on the battlefield. Once we have multiple [Lux Cannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon)s with proliferate going, it's only a matter of time before our opponents are completely out of the game. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab130_3cards2.jpg)  
Speaking of proliferate, [Contagion Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine) does it twice. I don't want to be crazy and play more than one copy, but a few copies of [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) could make us find it with some level of consistency. Imagine having a [Contagion Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine) on the 'field alongside a pair of [Lux Cannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon)s. Yeah, it seems like a lot of fun. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab130_3cards3.jpg)  
[Spine of Ish Sah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah) is another [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) target that can do some crazy things in a deck like this. We can destroy a permanent every turn if we have a [Throne of Geth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth) going. It isn't unreasonable to imagine a board state where we cast the Spine multiple times in a single turn. 

[Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) is an absolute house in this type of deck. The charge counters grow as we proliferate, so we start being able to produce a lot of mana in the mid- to late-game. We can use this mana to start a chain with our [Spine of Ish Sah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah). 

![Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Everflowing+Chalice)  
[Semblance Anvil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Semblance+Anvil) has been screaming for me to play with it and I've obliged a few times. This seems like the perfect deck for a card like this. [Spine of Ish Sah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah) seems very undercosted when it only costs five to destroy a permanent every turn. Throw in some [Lux Cannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) activations and your opponent will have no permanents left on the battlefield before you know it. 

![Semblance Anvil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Semblance+Anvil)  
Now I need some win conditions. [Precursor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precursor+Golem) and [Myr Battlesphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Battlesphere) are the first two that come to mind. Both creatures "wear scarves" (they can't be targeted by [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat)) and put very fast clocks on our opponent. [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) and [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) also seem like great fits for this type of strategy. The card advantage is always welcome and I'd like to have access as needed to cards like [Spine of Ish Sah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah), [Contagion Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine), [Myr Battlesphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Battlesphere), [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality), [Brittle Effigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brittle+Effigy), and [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice). 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab130_scarves.jpg)  
I'm worried about the speed of decks like Kuldotha Red, so I've included three copies of [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm). 

Here's the final sixty.

I played a few games with the deck to see how it did against some of the most threatening decks in Standard:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab130_match1header.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab130_crusader.jpg)I won the roll and kept [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), [Semblance Anvil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Semblance+Anvil), [Myr Battlesphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Battlesphere), [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage), [Lux Cannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon). I played my land and passed the turn. My opponent played an [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) and passed the turn back. I drew another [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage), cast [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for one, and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Plated Geopede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede) and passed the turn. I drew a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), played it, cast [Semblance Anvil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Semblance+Anvil), exiled [Myr Battlesphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Battlesphere), cast [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage), and searched my library for [Spine of Ish Sah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah). 

My opponent didn't know I had a [Contagion Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine) and I had another [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) in hand. I wanted to keep that play as an option in the future.

My opponent played a fourth land, cast both other [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s, attacked for 1, and passed the turn.

My opponent played for a bit with no permanents, but eventually I drew a [Precursor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precursor+Golem) and was able to seal up the game. I was showed the [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and Bolt at the end of game, but I had [Throne of Geth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth) to sacrifice the targeted Golem.
