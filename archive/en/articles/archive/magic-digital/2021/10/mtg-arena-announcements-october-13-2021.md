Historic: Bans, Suspensions, and Rebalancing Announced
======================================================


As we continue to improve the Historic format, [we have announced the rebalancing of five digital-only cards, plus some bans and suspensions](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-13-2021-banned-and-restricted-announcement):


Suspended in Historic:


* [Memory Lapse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse)

Banned in Historic:


* [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) (moved from suspended)
* [Tibalt's Trickery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tibalt%27s+Trickery)

These five digital-only cards have been rebalanced to address problems and improve the Historic format:




| Card Name | Changes | Rebalanced Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Davriel's Withering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=534595) | Now requires an opponent to control the target. | MTG Arena rebalanced card of Davriel's Withering |
| [Davriel, Soul Broker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=534594) | Third ability now requires an opponent to control the target. | MTG Arena rebalanced card of Davriel, Soul Broker |
| [Faceless Agent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=534580) | Power/toughness changed from 2/1 to 2/2. | MTG Arena rebalanced card of Faceless Agent |
| [Sarkhan, Wanderer to Shiv](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=534601) | Exiles itself instead of shuffling itself into your library. | MTG Arena rebalanced card of Sarkhan, Wanderer to Shiv |
| [Subversive Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=534598) |  * Mana cost changed from {B}{B} to {1}{B}.
* Power/toughness changed from 2/2 to 2/3.
* First mode power/toughness adjustment changed from +1/+2 to +1/+1.
* Second mode power/toughness adjustment changed from +3/+3 to +3/+2.

(The net effect of the power/toughness changes is the same, it will be either 3/4 or 5/5. This change makes it have 3 toughness instead of only 2 until the ability resolves.) | MTG Arena rebalanced card of Subversive Acolyte |

Details on all of these changes are covered in the [Banned and Restricted Announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-13-2021-banned-and-restricted-announcement)—check it out for explanations, plus a complete rundown on how live balancing works in *MTG Arena*.

Sunsetting MTG Arena Forums
===========================


Today, the sun sets on the *MTG Arena* forums. They were invaluable during our beta periods when they allowed our development team to communicate directly with the small group of our initial players. When *MTG Arena* launched, most of the conversation moved elsewhere, and it's time we better supported those platforms.


We know having an official place to engage with our development team and to interact with other players is important, which is why we're continuing to work towards launching our [*Magic* Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wZEDMaJwMY). In the meantime, you can still expect the latest news and updates from our weekly announcement article and by following us [@MTG\_Arena](https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena). The latest patch notes are always available in [our *MTG Arena* help center](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/sections/4402585813268-Patch-Notes).
