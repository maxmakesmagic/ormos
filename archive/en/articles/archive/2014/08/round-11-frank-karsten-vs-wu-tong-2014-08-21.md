A little jet-lagged and a little sleepy, Frank Karsten has made the trip of nearly five thousand miles to arrive in boisterous Beijing. Aside from a short vacation in this historically rich and culturally vibrant city, Karsten is here to grab some Pro Points in the process, hoping to give chase to fellow Hall of Famer Kamiel Cornelissen for the Netherlands captain spot in the upcoming World **Magic** Cup.


At an 8-2 record, Karsten has been paired against one of the best players in Mainland China. The very same year André Coimbra was crowned World Champion in 2009, Wu Tong was also made a World Team Champion, alongside fellow countrymen Li Bo and Zhang Zhiyang.


Despite geographical differences, this isn't the first time both players have played against each other. In fact, just a month ago at Valencia, their fates clashed after both players went 2-0 at the first Booster Draft. Karsten lost that match, sending Wu to a great 3-0 start for the Pro Tour, and was probably looking to exact revenge today.


**Game One**


Karsten kicked of the game with [Temple of Deceit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Deceit) and [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), promptly creating a copy on his third turn. Wu was not to be outdone and unloaded a bunch of green men, creating an army of [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr), [Kalonian Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Tusker) and [Experiment One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) (now a 2/2).


When Wu tried to put five counters on a potentially 6/6 [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter), Karsten deftly dealt with it using [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) while its trigger was on the stack, before it could grow to epic proportions.


Regardless, Wu decided to attack with [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr), [Kalonian Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Tusker) and [Experiment One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One). A little behind on the board state, Karsten decided to shove both his [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s in the way, offering a trade with [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) and a 2/2 [Experiment One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One). Wu reloaded with [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) and [Swordwise Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swordwise+Centaur).


A pair of [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall)s reduced Wu's troops to just a single [Swordwise Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swordwise+Centaur) but he was ready with a second [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr), bestowing it this time. The 7/4 centaur slashed Karsten's life total by more than half, reducing him from 13 to 6.


Before folding to the pressure, Karsten took a peek at the last card from Wu's hand via [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and had to read the rather interesting card twice. Apparently [Armed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armed) // Dangerous is as dangerous as it looks.

**Frank Karsten 0 – Wu Tong 1**



**Game Two**


[Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) plucked [Kalonian Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Tusker) away, and Karsten religiously jotted down relevant cards like [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) and [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile) on his scorepad.


Not surprisingly, Wu led with the mana elf, but was unwilling to cast [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) as a lowly 3/3. With so many creatures offering multiple green mana symbols in his deck, he decided to take a glimpse into the future using [Temple of Abandon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Abandon). His gamble paid off, receiving [Burning-Tree Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Shaman) off the top. This enabled him to make a 5/5 [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) for a measly three mana, one of the most powerful plays in his nearly Mono Green Devotion deck.


Karsten was not to be outdone and resolved [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) as well as [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), hoping to blunt the assault.


When Wu attacked with [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter), it prompted Karsten to confirm that Wu did not wish to sacrifice a creature. Shoving demon in the way in an attempt to force out [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile), Wu surprised him with Aspect of the Hydra, granting an impressive +5/+5 for one mere mana.


Wu then made a second [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter), a 6/6 monstrosity this time. Karsten tried to relieve himself of some pressure, pointing [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) at it, successfully baiting out the [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile) he had already seen. When Karsten next pointed [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) at it, Wu revealed the final card in his hand, which turned out to be a second copy of [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile) which Karsten was unaware of.


"I only have two [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile) in the sideboard. I was lucky to draw them both," Wu admitted. Facing a duo of huge [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter)s, Karsten was forced to chump block with [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) before eventually extending the hand.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/events/2014/gpbei14/r11_karsten.JPG)
*Despite being beat by double [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter) and double [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile), Frank Karsten was all smiles for the camera.*

**Frank Karsten 0 – Wu Tong 2**



Wu Tong defeats Frank Karsten 2-0 and moves up a notch to 11-2.
