### COMMAND TOWER


Not Vengeance, Punishment
=========================

Adam "Stybs" Styborski joined DailyMTG.com in 2009 to take over Serious Fun, before switching over to begin Command Tower in 2013. With his passion for Commander and community inclusion, you'll find plenty of opportunity each week to share your thoughts about everyone's favorite casual format.

Big ideas in *Magic* are hard to find. There are things like [New World Order](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/new-world-order-2011-12-01), the design and development philosophy meant to reduce complexity while maintaining strategic variety and depth. Then there's [Timmy, Johnny, and Spike](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2013-12-03): the "psychographic profiles" of *Magic* players. Ideas like these are pillars that shape the way we understand the game, as well as work on it for those few that do.

[Long-Term Plans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Long-Term+Plans) | Art by [Ben Thompson](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=[%22Ben+Thompson%22])


I don't believe I have any big ideas about Commander. My ideas are small but immediately applicable, like "[Play more basic lands](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ct/250)." And "[Be unafraid to try new things](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ct/291)." It's a function of writing this column: I need ideas that can be conveyed clearly in decks that rack up 100 cards and are encapsulated in your feedback. Digestible, practical, and self-contained are my typical requirements.


But there's one idea I've been working on for some time to distill down into its core pieces, and I needed the right kind of deck and feedback to bring it to bear. It's a term I've borrowed from the design of another game because that's where it all started to gel together: Active Mitigation.


Let me start with a question with an answer that might not be obvious: What are you fighting in Commander? If you choose to make your primary target your opponents, I have some bad news: Every four-player game ends with more losers than victors. I don't want to spend most of my games strictly looking for every opening to kill off enemies, although I'll usually take them when I find them. Instead, what I want to most is *advance the game state* by: dealing damage, disrupting defenses, answering the specific threats that cause stagnation, and in the broadest sense being a "pest" to players who are trying to set things up.


That's the principle behind active mitigation: Choosing to use spells and resources in a way that moves the overall game closer to conclusion by stopping staleness and reducing life totals.


When [we looked at speeding up Commander games earlier this year](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ct/293), it focused more on easy ways to kill opponents and rules changes that made damage mean more. While that's helpful in some ways, it's based on an unstated assumption: even when they're actively winning, players are playing to not lose in Commander.

[Thrill-Kill Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrill-Kill+Assassin) | Art by [Tyler Jacobson](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=[%22Tyler Jacobson%22])


From little things like having a 1/1 that can attack uninhibited on turn two that sits back instead of getting in there, to packing waves of [Planar Cleansing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Cleansing) effects just to set up an ultimate turn, so many Commander decks focus on dealing with *everything* that *nothing* happens. While dealing with "everything" is an effective way of stopping the damage other players could do, it's also terribly boring.


Multiplayer games mean you're always facing disadvantages. You draw one card, your opponents together draw three times that. Every turn you take means three (not one) to wait through, meaning you can be attacked three times for every one of yours.


I get the allure of simply bringing everyone else to a standstill: Opponents without options aren't so scary. But the glacial pace of games like that are awkward at best. That's what active mitigation is meant to fight.


Take a look at this [Pharika, God of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction) deck to see some of what I mean:

There's a lot going on here that's obvious:



* Pharika can make plenty of 1/1 black-green deathtouch Snake tokens for us, thanks to the ample ways we'll put creatures into our own graveyard.
* There's mana ramping built on small creatures rather than instants and sorceries.
* Recursion, removal, and card draw are sprinkled throughout, but not a primary focus in any respect.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pharika, God of Affliction)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika, God of Affliction)
But there are some subtle changes I made to this deck that speak volumes about how it approaches games:



* Pharika can give *other players* deathtouch Snakes at instant speed, providing pseudo-removal and deterrents for others at will.
* [Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jarad%2C+Golgari+Lich+Lord); [Lord of Extinction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Extinction); [Spearbreaker Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearbreaker+Behemoth); and [Svogthos, the Restless Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Svogthos%2C+the+Restless+Tomb) are all ways to hit highs and lows, despite Wrath effects.
* [Moonsilver Spear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonsilver+Spear), [Korozda Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Korozda+Guildmage), [Sepulchral Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sepulchral+Primordial), and [Genesis Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave) are all effects that can go big thanks to ample mana the longer the game goes, and can turn groups of small fries into victory conditions.
* Wrath variants that can narrowly hit some permanents ([Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) against tokens) or players ([Overwhelming Forces](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Forces)) can handle plans on a larger scale without necessarily bombing the battlefield back into the Stone Age.

These latter tools are vague examples of active mitigation. I want to continually chip away at opponents, bringing bigger hits when they're needed, applying evasion and token strategies wisely, and throwing up temporary shields when the heat gets turned up on me. [Moonsilver Spear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonsilver+Spear) on a deathtouch creature may be cute, but swinging in for "just 1" leaves a much more threatening 4/4 flying white Angel token behind...and good odds that I'm moving the Spear to another deathtouch creature.


Active mitigation is all about moving forward. Instead of focusing on ensuring the ultimate turn can be set up or stifling everyone else's ambitions (or *both*), it's about making attacks at every turn and keeping opponents off balance. Instead of a static-wipe-static cycle of battlefields, I'm constantly looking for ways to inch the game forward, even if it's just attacking with a measly 1/1 or giving an opponent or two creatures along the way.


By Fire Be Cleansed
===================


Active mitigation isn't the primary goal of my [Mogis, God of Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter) [deck I shared the other week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ct/pray-for-prey-2014-08-07).

99 Cards 



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter)



















This deck is meant to punish opponents. It annihilates creatures, blows up plenty of permanents, and unleashes torrents of destructive blasts that incinerate or drain opponents dry. It's a deck I break out when I want to play a shorter game (I'm usually the first to be targeted and defeated in games with it) and ensure the game I leave behind ends soon thereafter.


It was built intentionally clunky, but after playing several games it become too unwieldy. I wanted it to proceed smoother and apply more modest means of keeping games disrupted. I left it to you to tell me what to do without prompting you. While being oblique is dangerous, readers like Stephen figured it out:


Whenever I go about helping someone fix a Commander deck, my first question is always, "What is it you want this deck to do?" Without that knowledge, I looked at the list trying to figure out what to do with it. I saw that [Temporal Manipulation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Manipulation) and realized it was supposed to be a [Temporal Extortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Extortion), then I looked across and saw Zo-Zu, the Punisher. That's when it hit me...MOGIS IS THE PUNISHER (i.e. the comic book anti-hero). Mogis wants to extort, murder, and punish his enemies, so I decided to give this deck a bit of a Vorthos infusion in honor of the man with the Swamp logo on his chest!


**Out:**



1. [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov)

5. [Soul Burn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Burn)
6. [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist)
7. [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge)
8. [Tyrant's Choice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tyrant%27s+Choice)
9. [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath)
10. [Everlasting Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment)
11. [Lake of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lake+of+the+Dead)
12. [Rakdos Guildgate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Guildgate)

I like that what Stephen proposed here tips the scales away from relying as heavily on big mana spells and instead layers in additional effects that eat up life in the normal course of games. [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) and [Final Punishment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Punishment) can turn what were ordinary turns into extraordinary damage. There are enough sacrifice effects kicking around that the odds are great [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist)'s triggers will both refuel my life and upend a few life totals.


Archie took a different approach. He considered the synergy (or lack thereof) and touched it up a bit:


I tried to keep to the spirit of your original creation; however, I feel there are some changes you could make to increase the synergy and efficiency of the deck:


**Out:**



* [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life) and [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit): Both don't play well with your colorless mana ramp and only target single players.
* [Killing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Killing+Wave): It's a cool spell, but the choice it gives to your opponents is not appealing, as it means they get to keep the one key creature that you really, really want to kill
* [Defiler of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiler+of+Souls) and Anowon the Ruin Sage: Both have bad synergy with your other creatures as only three of them are multicolored and only four of them are Vampires.
* [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov): This is a personal removal for me as I very much dislike the "Set to 10" ability as it always feels very unfun to me.

**In:**



* [Thespian's Stage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage): As you are trying to ramp so hard, I feel 36 lands are too few and the Stage can provide both mana fixing and a second [Cabal Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers).
* [Gratuitous Violence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gratuitous+Violence): It has great synergy with a devoted Mogis and provides three devotion itself, as well as helping Zo-Zu, [Anathemancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anathemancer), [Fate Unraveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Unraveler), etc.
* [Akroma's Memorial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Memorial): This seems like a windmill slam to me with all the [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) effects that you are playing, as well as providing a powerful effect on its own.
* [Dictate of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+Erebos): It provides another [Grave Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact) as well as some great devotion and somewhat offsets the loss of the Defiler and Anowon.
* [Exquisite Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exquisite+Blood): It's an easy way to gain some life as well as making up for some of the lifegain you are losing with [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life) and [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit).
* [Into the Core](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Core): Adds some artifact hate, which I feel every deck needs.

Hope these suggestions are helpful.


I think these changes would be helpful, Archie. Patching in better coordination between cards means, at the most basic level, the deck will work better. Cards in concert are always more powerful than a pile of individual standouts, and I'm guilty of "making piles" instead of cohesive decks more often than not: Mogis here included.


Of course, some of you rebuilt the entire deck for me, which was beyond the call of duty. (Thanks!) Adrin looked at ways to accelerate the process slightly while layering in traditional Commander wants:


I really liked the idea of Mogis applying pressure while keeping the creature count low with creature-wipe/burn spells, but I made some major changes in order to add the following concepts.



1. Devotion to red and black: With 40 life, "Sac or [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)" is a pretty slow process. As Rakdos colors, it would be terrible manners to have your guests (opponents) bored! Since we will be wiping off creatures every now and then, I added some high-devotion enchantments ([Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath), [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence), etc.) so that Mogis himself can entertain the guests. (As a creature, he has 7 power for three-hit kills and is indestructible!)
2. Permanent removal: Yes, these are Rakdos colors, but still. [Lux Cannon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated), [Chaos Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Warp). You'll be glad when the blue guy uses [Take Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Possession) on Mogis.
3. Double Damage: Between [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) and sac, I'll choose [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) most of the time, but what if it's [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) or sac? I've added [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath) cards and Equipment such as [Inquisitor's Flail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisitor%27s+Flail) as well, because double damage goes nicely with commander damage, and you'll be able to two-hit unsuspecting opponents. (Or even one-hit if you're lucky!)
4. More draw engines: *When asked how many cards are required, Commander players always answered "more."*

And then some other minor changes for laughs, with plenty of potential to inflict pain ([Phage the Untouchable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable), [Fork](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork), and so on). Happy hunting!

99 Cards 



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter)



















Adrin picked up that once the deck enters the late game, odds were good that I was low on cards while others were still high on life totals. Addressing that neatly, this pulls Mogis closer to what you'd typically see in Commander games without losing the essence of what I had started. While this doesn't suit what I would do myself, the ideas and cards here are excellent lists of options to consider when building your own Mogis deck.


Justin retooled things to maintain the glass cannon nature of my current build, but added plenty of surprises to catch opponents off guard:


This was a fun project to work on! First off, I kept the martyr aspect of your deck intact, but decided to shore up some weaknesses and prune some of the distracting minor themes (e.g., land ETB damage).


Regarding the mana base, I decided to add a few land-search options and reduce the artifact count, so artifact removal doesn't blow out your mana base. I added [Diamond Valley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diamond+Valley), [Maze of Ith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith), [Homeward Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homeward+Path), and [Winding Canyons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Canyons) to add much-needed utility. I removed creatures that need to be out multiple turns for them to affect the board, which probably won't happen with your low creature count and high "wrath" count. I removed [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov) and [Wound Reflection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wound+Reflection) because I don't think these cards are appropriate for casual Commander. Lastly, I lowered the mana curve as you suggested to an average CMC of 3.61 and removed a ton of high-mana-cost X spells.


I added lifegain to make the deck last a bit longer. Although it's still very much a martyr deck, you shouldn't have to die first every game! I also added instant-speed removal to counter those pesky big beaters that will come your way. I also added a new subtheme to the deck of instant-speed creature summoning with [Dawn of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+of+the+Dead) and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) to scare opponents who have you in their sights. A few of the more interesting additions are (1) [Tainted Æther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+%C3%86ther) to make tokens players cry, (2) [Bloodchief Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodchief+Ascension), because it's amazing with Mogis, and (3) [Soul Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Conduit) as a crafty finisher.


Have a blast!

I love big, splashy spells like [Rise of the Dark Realms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+of+the+Dark+Realms) and flavorful ways to fight back against opponents like [Vengeful Pharaoh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh). [Tainted Æther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+%C3%86ther) is interesting since it can both head off token armies *and* layers on more punishment for making a creature someone wants to keep around, including our own. While land destruction isn't my usual bag in Commander, the odds that a few lands going away around the table (before someone gets fed up enough to destroy an enchantment) won't derail the game are pretty good.

===========


What I'll eventually do with [Mogis, God of Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter) isn't clear yet, but your ideas were awesome for pointing me in exciting directions. I'll be sure to share once things have been tweaked thoroughly.


This week's question is our way to putting a bow on *Magic 2015* and its effect on our decks:  **Which cards from *Magic 2015* have had the biggest effect on your Commander games, and why?** 



* [Feedback via email](mailto:commandtowerstybs@gmail.com)
* 300-word limit to explain the *Magic 2015* card(s)
* **Sample decklist or list of cards is requested** (does not count against word limit)
* Decklists should be formatted with one card per line with just a leading number, such as "3 Mountain"—just a space (no "x" or "-") between the number and the card name, *without* subtotals by card type (Submissions that don't follow this rule will be ignored.)
* Name and email required (non-personal information to be used in column)

Join us next week when we use a wedge to gain leverage over opponents. See you then!
