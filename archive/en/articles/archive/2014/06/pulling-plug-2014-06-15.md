 Even if you happened to be a regular follower of our official coverage, you might have mistaken Dmitriy Butakov's Top 8 finish at Grand Prix Valencia as his "breakout performance". It was anything but that since Butakov had already taken down the **Magic** Online Championship earlier that year. So even after someone pulled the plug from his PC, he continued to show great skills, demonstrating that it is possible to make the transition from online to the card game.



I wanted to know how hard it was for him to adapt to the different environment and learn a little more about the unique challenges of that transition.



**You are notorious for putting hundreds of hours into **Magic Online**. How do you keep your motivation high after having played so many games and are you the most active player in the world?** 



"I know the most active player - and it isn't me."


"Regarding the other question, truth be told, it's not always exciting, but I see it as my job. I generate 90 % of my income this way. There aren't any other jobs that are tempting me at the moment, so this is my best option by far. And I do have fun a lot of the time."



**What is the largest amount of qualifying points you have amassed over one season of Magic Online?** 



"138, I think."



**That's just crazy... what are your favorite formats and decks?**



"It's a luxury for me to have a favorite format. I play all of the formats and I always choose the deck I'm most comfortable with (and that has a good chance of securing me quite a few wins). I never play Limited, though, since it's so hard to grind in this format."



**Alright, but if we break it down, what would your list look like?**



"In Legacy, I prefer Shardless BUG - it's very interactive and it offers quite a few interesting plays."


"In Standard... well, generally speaking, I prefer controlish decks. So I will often pick either Esper or Bant for this format."



 "In Modern, I love Gifts Rock, but it's very hard to play several tables at once with the deck, which is making it a bad choice for me. But if I play less than 3 events at the same time, I'll most likely play it. If I play 4 tables at a time, I'll be playing [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)."




 "Oh, and I'm really looking forward to Vintage on **Magic Online**! It's gonna give me something new to do."






*Dmitryi Butakov is taking the **Magic** World by storm!*
