Feedback Week is an interesting task for Building on a Budget. Most of my articles are already based on feedback or ideas that have been sent in by readers. Fortunately, this week is exceptionally exciting for those of us who love to brew. Just last week, Wizards [announced](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/welcome-modern-world-2011-08-12) Modern as the new Constructed format of [Pro Tour Philadelphia](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/magicweekend/philadelphia11). Since then, I've been flooded with emails and Facebook messages from readers who are excited to get into the trenches and battle some Modern.

Today, I'd like to talk about a Modern deck that a lot of readers have asked for. Since the announcement, a lot of you have been eager to see what my latest [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) deck looks like. "Sunny Side Up" was originally piloted by Pierre Canali and friends at [Worlds in 2006](/en/events/coverage/mihara-dutch-crowned-world-champions). In 2008, Steve Sadin, Gabe Carleton-Barnes, Jamie Parke, and I decided that the format was in a good spot for Eggs to make a comeback.

![Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Second+Sunrise)  
Eggs is a powerful and consistent combo deck that wins the game on turn three or four by looping [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) and cheap artifacts that tap to draw cards. (I'll explain exactly how it works below.) It's extremely budget given the Modern-format baseline, but it's easily disrupted by graveyard hate and [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void). This deck is a favorite amongst math nerds like myself, as the fractions of a percentage one can acquire by playing the cards in the correct order will add up fast.

We played the deck at [Pro Tour Berlin](/en/node/502416) and didn't do as well as we had hoped to. Since then, the Eggs deck has fallen into obscurity. It hasn't been Extended legal for some time, and its weakness to cards like [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) and [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) have kept it from entering the fray in Legacy events.

[Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) is legal in Modern, but we have no idea how popular it will be. If [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) / [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) control decks become popular, then this deck won't be a good choice. Right now, however, it seems as if everyone is looking at Zoo, Boros, and Jund (often [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast)â€“based) strategies. Eggs is very well positioned as long as that's the case.

| Chalice of the Void | Melira, Sylvok Outcast |

This deck's ability to be competitive is heavily dependent on the metagame. If players are afraid of [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) and bring in cards like [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) and [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus), then this deck might have a lot of trouble. However, if players decide that [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) is the best graveyard hate spell because of its strength against combo, then this deck will be absolutely fine.

[Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) may seem like a nightmare, but *New Phyrexia* introduced a powerful spell that fits perfectly in the strategy and doubles as an incredible defense against [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction). [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival) is a strict upgrade from [Reclaim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim) that can grab the targeted card from our graveyard and put it on top of our deck even when we don't have any mana left in our pool.

A lot of you may look at this pile of cards and have no idea what it's supposed to do. The combo may be complex and difficult to pilot, but you should have no problem winning games consistently on the third turn once you master the intricacies of this strategy.

Here's how it works. I spend the first two or three turns casting artifacts that I can sacrifice to draw cards. I sacrifice all my artifacts once I find a [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape) (to tutor up a [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom)) or my [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) comes off suspend. In doing so I draw a bunch of cards. Then I use whatever [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s I have to find a [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). I use [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) to target my own lands and search up additional islands to empty my hand of as many artifacts as possible and thin my library. I cycle [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) and draw additional cards.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Lotus Bloom | Reshape |

When I'm out of mana or cards, I sacrifice my [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) for white mana and cast [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). In doing so, I generate a huge amount of mana by bringing back all the lands that I destroyed or sacrificed along with the [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). All the artifacts are also returned to the battlefield, and I'm able to sacrifice them all again to draw a lot of cards. If I'm unable to find another [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise), then I use [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival) to put the first one back on top of my deck and then draw it by sacrificing one of my artifacts. I cast all the artifacts I draw and use [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) on my own lands after I tap them for mana again. I use this mana to cast more artifacts from my hand and use them to draw more cards. When I run out of mana or cards I sacrifice my [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) and cast [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) again.

Eventually, I draw my entire library. I'm then able to use [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) to loop the [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) and use [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) to deal 20 points of damage to my opponent. If my opponent has some type of [Ivory Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Mask) effect in play then I can use [Sunbeam Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb) to gain infinite life and loop my [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival)s to ensure I never run out of cards and will eventually deck my opponent.

| Conjurer's Bauble | Pyrite Spellbomb |

I suggest playing A LOT of solitaire games before you play this deck in any real matches. The complexities involved in operating the deck correctly are mind boggling. It may sound extreme, but I wouldn't be surprised if Eggs was the most difficult deck to pilot optimally in the history of tournament **Magic**. I've played hundreds of matches with this archetype over the past five years, and I have a lot of advice for aspiring breakfast cooks.

I tend to use the following priority when casting my "eggs." I will cast [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) over every other artifact, it has the best synergy with [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape) and it requires no mana to produce card advantage with [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). I will cast [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) or [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) next; both have even priority because neither requires any additional mana investment to produce card advantage with [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). I will cast [Elsewhere Flask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elsewhere+Flask) next. It has a higher mana cost, but it has the same cost free card advantage as the Star and Sphere. Finally, I cast the Spellbombs. The Spellbombs are not ideal when comboing off, but if you have the extra mana you should use the Spellbombs to draw some extra cards in the process.

Remember to be conservative with your mana when going off. If you have four mana left in your pool including a [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), then it's incorrect to cast a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) or [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) before you cast your [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). However, if you have five mana, then it becomes correct to cast the [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) or [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) because it may find you a copy of [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble), [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star), or [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), that may end up netting your four or five cards in the process of going off. Remembering small complexities like this one is very important if you want to ensure that there's no chance of fizzling during the combo.



|  |  |

| Preordain | Ponder |

It's important to be very careful which card you put on the bottom of your library with your [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble). If you only have a single copy of [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) in your graveyard, then it's better to put a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), or [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) on the bottom of your library. The four copies of [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival) make having a single copy of [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) in the graveyard important if you need to put it on the top of your library. However, if you have multiple copies of [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) in your graveyard, then it's important to put the extras on the bottom of your library to increase your chances of drawing them when you're comboing and shuffling your library. There are some scenarios in which it becomes correct to put [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape) on the bottom of your library. Putting [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape) on the bottom will normally be correct when you're going off on turn two or three and you only have a single [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) and [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) looping. During this phase of the loop you may be a bit mana starved, and finding another [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape) is very important if you want to generate enough mana to dig through your entire deck.

The ordering of when to sacrifice which artifacts and activate your [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) can be complex at times. You want to sacrifice your [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) first to put the desired card back into your library and increase your chances of drawing it. Then you want to use your [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) to shuffle that card back into your library and thin your deck of lands. You can go ahead and draw a ton of cards with the rest of your artifacts once your deck has been thinned of basics and had a live card shuffled back in.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab156_ghost.jpg)  
Don't play a land on the turn you're going off unless it's a [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter). [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) will net you a ton of mana and thin your deck so you draw more artifacts and action spells while going off. The deck plays few enough land that it's very unlikely to whiff when you draw eight to ten cards. You should be able to use your mana carefully and go off without a single extra mana from the [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) you might play until you find the [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter).

Sometimes you need to loop your [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) without two [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom)s. To do this you need to 1) add one blue mana with an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island); 2) destroy it with [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter); 3) sacrifice [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) for three white mana; 4) cast [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) using ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif); and 5) use [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) to return the [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). You can perform this loop infinitely and create unlimited white mana, then begin sacrificing the [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) for red mana and looping [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) for the kill.

Did you get all that? Again, I recommend playing some solitaire games with the deck and coming back to reread the above advice periodically. It's a lot of information to absorb in a single sitting.

I put together my [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) Eggs deck, and I've been goldfishing it every time I get a chance. I'm going to provide an example solitaire game in an effort to make all this information digestible.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab156_sunrise.jpg)I start the game with [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter), [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape), [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble), [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn), and [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival) in hand.

On turn one I play an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and cast [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere).

On turn two I draw a [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star), play [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter), cast [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star), and cast [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble).

On turn three I draw a [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) and see that I have the tools to go off. Here's what happens next:


> 
> 1. I tap my [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) for blue mana and destroy it with one of my [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter)s.
> 2. I search for another [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), tap it for mana, and destroy it with the other [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter).
> 3. I search for another [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), tap it for mana, and sacrifice it to cycle [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn). I draw a [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise).
> 4. I use two blue mana to cast [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape), sacrificing [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) and searching my library for a [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). I draw another [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) and cast it.
> 5. I sacrifice my [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) for white mana, sacrifice my [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) to put [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) back on the bottom of my library, sacrifice my [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star), and sacrifice my [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). I draw [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape), and [Reclaim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim) off the artifacts.
> 6. I cast [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) and return everything to the battlefield.
> 7. I cast [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival) targeting the [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) to put it back on top of my deck. I then sacrifice [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) to put the [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival) on the bottom of my deck and draw the [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise).
> 8. I cast [Reshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reshape) and sacrifice a [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) to search my library for another [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). I draw an [Elsewhere Flask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elsewhere+Flask).
> 

From there, I cast all the artifacts I've got, destroy all my lands with [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter)s, draw into a few more artifacts and cast them, and eventually reset again with [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). The [Reclaim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclaim) in my hand ensures that I'll have another [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) to continue looping and I'm home free to draw my entire deck. Once I've draw my entire deck I use the [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom)s to make red and white mana, I sacrifice my [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) to deal my opponent 2 points of damage, and cast my [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise). I use [Conjurer's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) to put the [Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) back into my hand and loop the Spellbomb with the [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom)s.

Eggs is one of the most interesting decks in the history of the game. Modern is a format where Eggs will, in all likelihood, be around forever. Learning how to play this deck can give you a profound appreciation for the complexities that are possible within the game of **Magic**. I hope you all enjoyed this in-depth look at Modern New York Eggs.

Happy brewing!
