Yes,but not much.

**What were your records in the drafts?**  
**What did you play, and did you have any key cards?**  

I went 3-0 in both, one with Blue-White featuring [Thassa's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Emissary), and the other with Red-Green splahing blue. The [Voyage's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End)s were key!

My teammates (Tzu-ching Kuo and Shi-Tian Lee) and I were all in contention for the Top 8. I'm surprised I was the one that made it because they're so much better than I am.
