So Brad Nelson was pretty unhappy with his deck. He showed it to Brian Kibler after losing his last round to drop to 4-1. "This might be the worst M12 limited deck I've ever seen," was the first thing Kibler said. He followed that comment closely with, "If you're to win a match this draft, you a) have to get *extremely* lucky, while b) your opponent gets *extremely* unlucky."


"My deck is pretty terrible too." Luis Scott-Vargas returned.


The usually chipper Brad Nelson was slightly frowning and slumping in his chair. This draft had gotten the best of him. On a lighter note, to figure out who went first, Luis laid two cards face down and said, "Pick the better card for constructed. Don't worry, it's not close." Nelson flipped over a [Wurm's Tooth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurm%27s+Tooth), while LSV showed a [Dragon's Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Claw).


"See? Not close. I'll play."

### Game One


They both kept and LSV played a turn-two [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) off a Mountain and a Plains. He then cast a [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) on it the following turn and attacked into a [Reassembling Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reassembling+Skeleton) that declined to block. When Scott-Vargas attacked again, Nelson's Skeleton happily joined the fray, because this time he was aided by a [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf). All three creatures went happily to the graveyard.


Scott-Vargas quickly refilled with an [Arbalest Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbalest+Elite) and an [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) returning the [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor). Nelson's refilling consisted of the Skeleton rising from the grave and a [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion). An un-aura'ed [Thran Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Golem) and an [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) attacked the following, making the totals 23-13 in Luis Scott-Vargas' favor. Brad's demeanor was getting lower, but it hadn't hit bottom yet. That came when he realized the [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) on Luis' [Thran Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Golem) also gave in Flying, in addition to First Strike, Trample. and +3/+5. Two turns later, Brad was at one. Three turns later, he was dead.


**Luis Scott-Vargas 1 – 0 Brad Nelson**


"I can see from the spells we cast that neither of us were exaggerating about our decks." Scott-Vargas said. Brad could only let out a slight chuckle.

### Game Two


Though Nelson went first, Scott-Vargas cast the inaugural spell in [Crown of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Empires). A turn-four [Reassembling Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reassembling+Skeleton) was Brad's sort-of response, to which Luis cast a [Rusted Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Sentinel).


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thran+Golem)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Golem)
The Sentinel's power was clearly too imposing, so an [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) answered it. LSV tried to add power with [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor), but before it could resolve, Nelson [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)d the Sentinel away.


Over a few turns LSV added a [Thran Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Golem), [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) (bloodthirsty, mind you) and a [Benalish Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran), who received a [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark). Brad had another [Reassembling Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reassembling+Skeleton) and a [Rusted Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Sentinel) of his own. There was an old fashioned stalemate round these parts.


That is, until Scott-Vargas cast a [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon).


Brad scoffed, drew his next card, and packed it in. I guess to Kibler's comment, neither a) nor b) happened for Brad. I didn't see him getting any happier as he walked away from the table.


**Luis Scott-Vargas 2 – 0 Brad Nelson**


Luis Scott-Vargas is now 5-1; Brad Nelson is 4-2.
