**What is the most commonly misplayed card in Standard?**


It’s easy to spot a glaring, game-losing mistake. The bulk of our errors are subtler, and can hide within a winning line of play. Nevertheless, every error cedes an advantage to the opponent and will wind up costing you in the long run. I asked some of our best players about some prime offenders.

**Shahar Shenhar, Reigning World Champion** – [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), probably. Any card that asks for decisions is going to be misplayed, and it’s easy to choose wrong from 7 cards.

**Adrian Sullivan, Top 4 Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*** – [Temple of Deceit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Deceit). People play it far too early just because it comes into play tapped. Often your first few turns are scripted already in your hand, and you don’t want to scry until later.

**Andrew Cuneo, 18th Ranked Player –** [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand). Between scrylands and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) you should often know the bottom cards of your deck, and sacrificing your Strand can make your draws a lot worse. It’s a small edge, but people don’t even consider it.
