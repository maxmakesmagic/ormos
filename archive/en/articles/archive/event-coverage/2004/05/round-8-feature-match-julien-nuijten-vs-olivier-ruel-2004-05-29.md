### Game 1


First thing Olivier does is showing me a card in his hand he thinks is so bad: a [Bane of the Living](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living). His first real plays are a [Vine Trellis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Trellis) and a [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum).  

Julien has 2 [Goblin Sharpshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter)s and suddenly the Bane isn't that bad anymore and takes out both Sharpshooters at the cost of a Solemn and the Bane himself.  

Julien has a Siege-Gang commander though to recover the losses a little.  

On his next turn Oliver kiles a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and a [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace) with the [Wirewood Symbiote](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote) - [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) combo.


A Warchief and the third Sharpshooter come down and Julien starts to shoot Olivier's creatures down. Good plan until Olivier drew an [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery) and started recurring his creatures. With Olivier still on 13 and a recurring [Bane of the Living](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living) all Julien could do was scoop up his cards.


Olivier 1-0


### Game 2


Julien started out with a mulligan but kept his 6 card hand game 2. Not a very good one though as he only plays 2 lands and a Sledder.


When Olivier looks at his opening 7 he starts laughing saying he's so bad; he forgot to board out his Death Clouds, which are really bad in the matchup against Goblins.  

Olivier has a good start though with [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery), Pulse of the Tangle, [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) ( killing a land in the proces ) and a Skullclamp.


Once Julien is up to 3 land again he is able to play 2 Sharpshooters.  

Olivier's whole team gets shot next turn but he's able to draw 3 cards off the Solemn combined with a Skullclampâ€¦.which gave him his one [Bane of the Living](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living) that is in his deck.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbru04/fm9_2.jpg)Julien sac's all of his Goblins in order to save 1 Sharpshooter. All of his hopes to go into day 2 undefeated get shattered as Olivier plays a [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) next turn. Since Olivier has an [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery) in play and Julien doesn't have anything to remove the Cemetery Olivier takes game and match.


Olivier Ruel and the [Bane of the Living](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living) beat Julien Nuijten 2-0
