One of the holy grails of great **Magic** decks is the ability to play an aggressive deck capable of running over your opponents quickly while maintaining the ability to make powerful plays as the game goes on. With the bestow mechanic, Carlos Moral was able to build a deck that was powerful in all stages of the game. At [Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptjou14/welcome), Carlos finished in 18th place on the back of his mono-black aggressive deck.



![Master of the Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Master%20of%20the%20Feast&options=)Ideally, this deck starts with either [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero) or [Gnarled Scarhide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Scarhide) and follows it up by playing additional threats each turn of the game. Simply playing a curve of creatures backed up by [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) can run over some decks. However, the deck has many clever tricks tucked within its efficient creatures. For example, [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero) would be efficient simply as a 2-power one-drop, but its heroic ability helps squeeze out a little extra value when you target him (usually with bestow). [Agent of the Fates](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+the+Fates) provides an even more powerful heroic effect.

Finally, [Master of the Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Feast) is well worth the drawback. A 5/5 flier for three mana is incredible, and if your goal is to kill your opponent quickly, he or she will be unable to take advantage of the extra cards the [Master of the Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Feast) provides.
