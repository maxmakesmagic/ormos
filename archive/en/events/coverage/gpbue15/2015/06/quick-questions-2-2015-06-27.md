**What Current Card Could Have a Bright Future in Standard?**


The cardpool for the current Standard format features some of the most exciting and powerful cards ever printed. Which previously overlooked card do you perceive to have a bright future in Standard

**Pascal Maynard** - [Sarkhan Unbroken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Unbroken) is very powerful and has the potential to win games by itself. Unfortunately, the available removal in Sarkhan Unbroken’s colors doesn’t match up well against the threats being played right now. The card seems like it would be very strong if that changed in the coming months.

**Ben Stark** - [Sarkhan Unbroken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Unbroken) needs a home. He needs a three-color ramp shell, but he can be very good.

**(24) Willy Edel** - Pharika, God of [Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Affliction). I don’t know why people aren’t playing this card. It nullifies Esper Dragons’ removal; it stops a lot of the [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)-[Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) decks; the snakes having deathtouch is very relevant. It is an amazing card for the format.

**(18) Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa** - If Demonic Pact is good (which I don’t think it is), Silumgar’s Command could really have a place there. It would make an easy way to bounce the Demonic Pact and exploit the advantage gained even further. Also, [Shorecrasher Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shorecrasher+Elemental) is a really powerful card that has been looking for a home.

**(21) Craig Wescoe** - [Yisan, the Wanderer Bard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yisan%2C+the+Wanderer+Bard) hasn’t had a chance to shine. Now, with a potential one-mana planeswalker, plenty of great two drops, and potential three-mana planeswalkers it seems like Yisan has finally found the home he’s been looking for.

**Luis Salvatto** - [Icefall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icefall) Regent sees very little play right now. The card is very good and it will become an important card in Standard when people start playing larger threats.
