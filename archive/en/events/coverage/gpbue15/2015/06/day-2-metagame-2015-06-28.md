700 players came to Buenos Aires with dreams of being crowned Grand Prix Buenos Aires Champion. After nine rounds of swiss, only 74 remain. Let’s take a moment to discuss what the metagame looks like as we head into the second day of competition.



The biggest news in terms of metagame is the lack of any dominant archetype or strategy. No single deck represents more than 15% of the field. Let’s talk about the archetypes with the biggest Day 2 presence this weekend.



Red-Green Devotion is the most represented archetype with 10 pilots penetrating into Day 2. Red-Green Devotion aims to ramp its mana into gigantic threats very early. It’s not unusual for the deck to play cards like [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) as early as the third turn and [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) trumps other midrange strategies with gorgeous efficiency. Most of the Red-Green Devotion pilots are currently sitting at 7-2; So, despite big numbers, it’s still a long road to the Top 8.



Surprisingly, Mardu Dragons is the second most represented deck on Day 2. The deck combines reasonable threats with very strong disruption and removal to punish control decks and most Green strategies.



Red decks account for just under 11% of the field today and they’re just as represented as Red-Green Devotion if you count the versions that are splashing for [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command).



Esper Dragons and Red-Green Dragons are close behind, both making up just under 10% of the Day 2 field.



Finally, Sidisi Whip has made some waves this weekend and despite being virtually non-existent in previous weeks, it’s proving itself to be one of the more successful archetypes this weekend.
