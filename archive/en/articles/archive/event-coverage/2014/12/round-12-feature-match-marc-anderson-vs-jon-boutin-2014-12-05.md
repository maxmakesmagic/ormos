With 27 points, Marc Anderson would be in with a draw. The bad news for him was that he was paired down against Jon Boutin, who would make it with a win. They shuffled up and battled for their spot in the Top 8.


Both kept, and they were off. Anderson led with [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and indulged in a Japanese face-slap. Nearby, Noah Long asked Anderson to give him similar focus, and Anderson obliged. Meanwhile Boutin had [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed, keeping both.


Anderson followed up with [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), and Boutin kept his two mana open in case of a dangerous turn. Anderson hit for two, played island and passed. At end of turn, Boutin spent four life to [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) the Cobra. He untapped, played a Nexus and passed. Anderson dropped [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) at end of turn. Boutin [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed it.


Anderson untapped and tapped four for [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). It resolved. Boutin untapped and considered things. "Four cards?" asked Anderson. "Yes, and they're all crazy," replied Boutin, "bordering on offensive how good they are." Anderson fetched a fifth land, animated his [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and hit for four. Boutin fell to ten. He sent the Pod home with a kicked [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil).


Boutin [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed and agonized over the decision, eventually sending both cards on their way. He tapped two more for [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), getting two more, and played a fifth land. Anderson played a sixth land and spent two life on [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) to play around [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). It resolved. Boutin hit, played a second Hawk, and passed. Anderson tried another end-of-turn Exarch, but it was [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed.


Anderson thoguht for a minute, then spent four on [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph). It resolved and he quickly Podded it into [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), untapping an island for [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). He kept one, and spent his last mana on [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). Boutin hit for two and tapped out for [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx). "Show me the [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin," said Boutin. Anderson obliged, taking the game.


Anderson 1 - Boutin 0


Boutin scowled at his opening seven. He peeked at the top three cards of his deck. "Was it getting there? Of course it was. Like always." He shuffled up and dealt six, then sighed. "Not cool, Zeus." He kept. After island, [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) from Anderson, he played a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) and searched out all its friends.


Anderson played [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and passed. Boutin played his third land and held back. Anderson played his third and passed back. Boutin hit for one and played a second Hawk, leaving [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) up. Anderson played [Scald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scald)ing Tarn, adding a mana, then tapped two more for a discounted [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), the Tarn and Cobra providing insurance against [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). After it resolved, he fetched island with the Tarn, and Podded his [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) into [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), targetting the [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). In response, Boutin cast [Divine Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering), clearing it off the table.

*Jon Boutin* |


Boutin swung with his two Hawks and an animated [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), learing two mana open. Anderson hit for one with his [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). Post-Combat he tried a [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), countered by [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak).


"You ready for the safest play you've ever seen?"


Boutin tapped four for day of Judgment. Anderson bounced back with [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), locking down [Seachrome Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast). Boutin played a plains and passed, taking six from the Titan, who locked down his [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). Anderson added [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and passed. Boutin played a Hawk, and took another eight for his trouble, falling to nine. Finally he was forced to [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), unable to squeeze any extra value out of Anderson.


It looked like Anderson was out of gas when he made no further play post-Wrath. Boutin played a Hawk and got in for a poison. Still Anderson had nothing. Boutin continued to poison him in the air. Anderson played [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), then a turn later [Solemn [autocard]Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+%5Bautocard%5DSimulacrum)[/autocard], and Boutin continued to fly over. The poison was adding up, he was already at six.


Anderson dropped [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) at end of turn, and went for the [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin, but Boutin had [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). Still, the Exarch and [Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simulacrum) were attacking, and Boutin was down to six life. He flew over for the seventh poison, then took another three down to three life. He slowly peeled the top card, then quickly flipped it onto the table: Sword of Feast and[Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famine). He animated his Nexus, then equipped, and both resolved. He flew over, and the game was his.


Anderson 1 - Boutin 1


Both players kept for the deciding game. Anderson led out with [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine). Boutin [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed, keeping one. Anderson fetched out an island and cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). He chose not to shuffle. Boutin played [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and passed. Anderson played his third land and went for the discounted [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). Boutin let it resolve.

*Marc Anderson* |


Boutin untapped and played a plains, passing the turn. Anderson played his fourth land and passed. Boutin's [Divine Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering) took care of the [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). He played a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and passed it back. Anderson fetched a land, untapped, and tried a second [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). Boutin tapped two for [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). He played a Sword of Feast and[Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famine) and a fifth land. With [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) in play, Anderson was in trouble.


He fetched up a sixth land and summoned [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth). Boutin equipped his Inkmoth and swung in. Anderson showed him [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim). Boutin [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed and put both on top. [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth) hit for four, and Anderson passed. Boutin tapped six for [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan), getting back his Sword. It was bad news when Anderson tapped mana at the end of his turn. Down came the Exarch, and then the [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin, backed by [Dispel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) for Boutin's [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember).
