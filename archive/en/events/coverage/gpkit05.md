GRAND PRIX KITAKYUUSHUU 2005
----------------------------


Best Top 8 Ever? Kitakyuushuu on Display
========================================




November 5-6, 2005












[日本語の取材へ](/en/node/559056)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkita05/champ.jpg)And it's over. All tolled, the eight players to make it to the top came to the Quarterfinals with a sum total of 56 Grand Prix appearances under their collective belts. Lumped together, these eight gentlemen have made almost half-a-*million* dollars at the game, making for one of the most talent-rich GP finales imaginable. In particular for Itaru Ishida and Masahiko Morita, getting into the Top 8 meant pulling ahead of Kai Budde in GP top 8 appearances with 15 showings each to date.


In the end, it was two blue decks, the Scepter-Chant and the fearsome [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge)-a-Tog that made it to the finals, with Tomohiro Kaji's [Urza's Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage) plus kicker ending the Ryou Ogura's hopes of taking home the trophy.


When we look at what today means for Extended, it's worth mentioning Makihito Mihara's accomplishment. While his brand-new archetype, hitting the scene a mere week after the new Extended environment kicked off at PTLA stopped at the semi-finals today, his [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam)-powered [Seismic Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Assault) deck is sure to get some attention from players the world over.


Will Mihara's Confinement-[Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault)-[Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life) "CAL" deck prove to be the kind of epoch-making tech that Tax-Edge was? Only time will tell, but we shouldn't have to wait too long. Extended remains in the spotlight as one of the chosen formats of Worlds in Yokohama, Japan at the end of this month.


May the best metagamers win!
