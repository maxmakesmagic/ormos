At the most recent Grand Prix, in [Cincinnati](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpcin14/welcome), some of the [Team ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing) guys decided to play Black Devotion with a couple twists. First, they chose to splash red for some game breakers like [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return), [Slaughter Games](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Games), and [Sire of Insanity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sire+of+Insanity). The second twist was by far the most interesting, as they chose to eschew [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) completely.



![Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rakdos%27s%20Return&options=)

With Mono-Black Devotion playing [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), Mono-Blue Devotion splashing [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), and the WU Control decks having several answers to an army of rats themselves, it's not surprising to see [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) drop off a little bit. However, it's always impressive when a player makes that leap and cuts the sacred cow, as he or she is either going to be considered a genius or a fool.


In this case, it seemed to work out for them. Eric Froehlich put up a solid Top 16 finish (which I'm sure he's less than happy about, but it's a solid finish nonetheless) while teammate David Ochoa finished 40th, presumably with the same decklist.


Consider this a lesson in deck building. A card that used to be the backbone of an archetype can be considered unplayable the next week. Don't be afraid to kill your darlings.
