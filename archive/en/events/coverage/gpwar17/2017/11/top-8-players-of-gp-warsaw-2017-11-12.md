**Age:** 21


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Lyon, France


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Won packs at Rhich Hagon's Trivia Game Show. Also, Bronze pro.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Sultai Energy. No time to test, and this was closest to what I was used to playing.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Blossoming Defense](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blossoming+Defense). The deck is all about protecting key threats.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Vraska's Contempt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%27s+Contempt). Came in in every single matchup.

**Age:** 22


**Occupation:** This year ... *Magic*


**Hometown:** Paris, France


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Two Grand Prix Top 16 finishes and two Pro Tours played.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Four-Color Energy. I'm a midrange guy.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Glorybringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer). It puts the opponent off-balance and it less expected now that most lists only have two.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


No card really stood out, it's more like a package of decent cards. I guess maybe [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), in the matchup against [God-Pharaoh's Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift).

**Age:** 21


**Occupation:** Employee


**Hometown:** Rovereto, Italy


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Two Grand Prix Top 64 finishes and some mediocre results.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Temur Energy. Less clunky than Four-Color Energy and the sideboard is great. Best deck in Standard.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Promo version of [Glorybringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer). You always draw it at the right moment.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), allows you to win against anti-Temur decks.

**Age:** 29


**Occupation:** IT manager


**Hometown:** Moscow, Russia


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


2008 national champion, many Pro Tour starts, but without any good finishes.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Mardu Vehicles, also known as "Mashinki!" I played this deck for a long time, since last season.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Heart of Kiran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) on turn two, can easily make a game.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Dusk // Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+%2F%2F+Dawn) leads to interesting plays and can completely turn a game.

**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Student/working at my local game store


**Hometown:** Poznan, Poland


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


A few 12-3 finishes at GPs.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


White-Blue [God-Pharaoh's Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift), because it has three of the best features a *Magic* deck can have—blue card selection, lots of value, and a good matchup versus "kanister" [otherwise known as Piotr Głogowski].


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Hostile Desert](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostile+Desert) and [Angel of Sanctions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Sanctions). Both hit hard and are great versus energy decks.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


The dream team of [Angel of Sanctions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Sanctions) and [Fairgrounds Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fairgrounds+Warden), once again great versus energy.

**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Wannabe *Magic* pro


**Hometown:** Wroclaw, Poland


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Three Grand Prix Top 8s, a few Pro Tour Top 16s.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Four-Color Energy. The black cards are powerful enough to make the splash worthwile. The matchup against Temur Energy is great.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Skysovereign, Consul Flagship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship). It's just a better version of [Glorybringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer). I regret that I didn't realize this on time before Pro Tour *Ixalan*.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Cartouche of Ambition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartouche+of+Ambition). Never played this card before, but my teammates told me to on Friday evening. I trusted them without any testing and it won three matches today. Thanks guys!

**Occupation:** Sports trader


**Hometown:** Tallinn, Estonia


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Two Grand Prix Top 8s, one Pro Tour Top 8, one World *Magic* Cup Top 8, seven Nationals Top 8s.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Green-Blue Pummeler. Looked like it was good in theory. Didn't have much time to test everything.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Not sure. I think without [Electrostatic Pummeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Pummeler) the deck would not exist.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


The one [Confiscation Coup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscation+Coup) I added at the last moment was basically the only card I boarded in. Not sure why some cards even are
