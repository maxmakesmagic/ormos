 The Round 8 feature match at GP Sydney saw homegrown Patty Robertson, who recently made the finals at GP Melbourne, face off against Japan's Tomoharu Saito, with 5 Pro Tour and 19 Grand Prix Top 8s (and a bunch of wins). Patty has a U/B/r deck, the splashing for a couple of [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike)s, while Saito has a W/G deck built around rushing out 2-drops and fetching powerful auras with [Heliod's Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Pilgrim).




 Robertson won the die roll and immediately elected to play. Saito eyed his opponent's two open Islands and a single Swamp and took the calculated risk of running out a [Heliod's Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Pilgrim). With no counterspell from Robertson, Saito fetched out a [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward), but also found himself stuck on 4 land. Robertson held cards in hand and kept open mana to respond to the [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward), but instead Saito kept developing his board, unable to find the mana he needed for the powerful enchantment.






*Tomoharu Saito would love to draw a land.*

  

 The board stalled, both building up the ground troops, but eventually Saito found his mana and risked rolling out the Sepectra Ward. He's was successful, and a [Sunblade Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblade+Elf) a couple of turns later allowed him to send in his army without fear to take the match.




**Robertson 0 - Saito - 1**




 Game 2, both players kept their starting seven with Patty playing first. Unfortunately for Robertson, Saito had an endless supply of 2-drops, while Robertson's first play was a Turn 4 [Haunted Plate Mail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Plate+Mail). Saito read the card, noted the lack of flying, and sent in his two Sunburst Pegasii. Robertson tried to stabilise with a [Soul of Ravnica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Ravnica) and [Typhoid Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Typhoid+Rats), but Saito Mass Calcified the board, leaving only the two Pegasii and the [Haunted Plate Mail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Plate+Mail) behind.






*Patty Robertson's been Calcified.*

  

 Robertson cast a [Necrogen Scudder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder), despite dropping perilously low in life. Saito snap exiled the flyer with a [Constricting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Constricting+Sliver). With Robertson so low on life he could no longer remove the Sliver without the Scudder returning from exile and draining him of 3 life. Robertson acknowledged the game was over and scooped.




**Patrick Robertson 0 - Tomoharu Saito 2**
