CHANDRA NALAAR
==============



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on September 18, 2013 










There is no virtue in subtlety—at least not as far as Chandra Nalaar is concerned. She’s a red-magic-wielding Planeswalker, and her specialty is pyromancy: spells of fire, fire, and more fire.


Chandra's spark ignited when she was still quite young. As she’s grown, so have her magic and planeswalking abilities. Impulsive, passionate, and short-tempered, Chandra is just as ready to explode as her ever-growing arsenal of spells.


Given her immense and unpredictable power, authority figures have sought to restrict and control Chandra, directly challenging her heated desire for independence and freedom. As Chandra's wild inner fire encounters world after world of rules and restrictions, the results are sure to be explosive.
