Art has always been a major part of **Magic**. By commissioning hundreds of new pieces of art every year, we work with many talented artists to fill cards with depictions of new heroes, beasts, monsters, and spells. As such, we have deep ties to the fantasy art community. One such tie is to a fantasy art show called [IlluXCon](http://www.illuxcon.com/), which is about to have its sixth annual gathering.

(To avoid any confusion, the art in the above logo is from IlluXCon and not any **Magic** artwork.)


IlluXCon 6 will run from 5 p.m. September 11th, 2013, through 5 p.m. September 15th, 2013, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. According to Patrick Wilshire, the show's organizer, there will be more than FORTY **Magic** artists in attendance including names such as [Lars Grant-West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Lars%20Grant-West%22%5D), [Volkan Baga](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Volkan%20Baga%22%5D), [Donato Giancola](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Donato%20Giancola%22%5D), [Chris Rahn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Chris%20Rahn%22%5D), [Mark Poole](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Mark%20Poole%22%5D), and many many more.


This looks to be one of the largest gatherings of **Magic** artists ever!


Not only is IlluXCon a chance for artists to share their art with the world and enter a juried competition, it is also a gathering where companies such as Wizards frequently do portfolio reviews to identify potential artists to work with.


Note that this is not a gaming convention, it's a gathering of some of the world's best fantasy art and artists. If that is something you're interested in then you should definitely check it out. Vorthos, I'm talking to you!


There are tickets available to [IlluXCon](http://www.illuxcon.com/) for the entire run of the show as well as a daily basis. You can purchase tickets as well as find out more from [the IlluXCon website](http://www.illuxcon.com/). You can also reach out to them via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/illuxcon) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/illuxcon).
