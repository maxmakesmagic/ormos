Grand Prix Copenhagen 2005
--------------------------


Nuijten Claims Second Grand Prix Title
======================================




November 5 - 6, 2005












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop05/winners_top.jpg) Julien Nuijten is the Grand Prix-Copenhagen champion, and it’s three for four as [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) claimed another Extended title.


Finally at Copenhagen, we got a hint as to how the complex metagame might unravel. It seems like we have a rock-paper-scissors format. While Affinity had a bad Day One, tournament leaders Olivier Ruel and Pasi Virtanen (as well as local boy Alexander Rathcke) managed to feast on Tog decks all the way into the Top 8. Only there was their charge halted by Boros Deck Wins and in particular [Kataki, War’s Wage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki%2C+War%E2%80%99s+Wage) . This left the way clear for Julien Nuijten’s Big Stinks Tog deck (just look for the little stinker) to knock out fellow countryman Wessel Oomens and then Finnish amateur Kim Valori in a brutal final.


So there you have it: Affinity beats [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) beats Boros Deck Wins beats Affinity. Add in about another 20 decks and you get close to the current Extended metagame.


With the World Championships only a few weeks away, current World Champion Julien Nuijten appears to be coming into ominous form. This title is his second Grand Prix crown in the last three months.

In this quarterfinal we get an all-Finn clash between two teammates from just outside Helsinki. Pasi Virtanen is actually more of a judge than a player, and this is only his second constructed tournament this century. He does have some PT and Worlds experience back in the dark days. On the other hand this is Kim Valori’s best ever finish and Hawaii will be his first Po Tour if he can make it. As he’s the only amateur in the top 8 my guess is he’ll be able to afford it.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop05/qf_valori.jpg)*Kim Valori.*
This is going to be short and bloody. Virtanen’s Affinity deck has managed to keep ahead of Boros Deck Wins all weekend, but now one has finally caught up with him and it’s time to pay the piper, or rather Kataki, War’s Wage.


Game 1 saw a turn two kill. Virtanen made some artifacts, Valori made Kataki. How do you like that kick in the nuts? As reported from Melbourne, it’s only taken R&D about 6 attempts to finally reign in the Affinity monster through actual cards.


Valori 1-0 Virtanen.


Virtanen at least has a bunch of answers in his board in the form of [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast) , [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) and [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) .


Virtanen laid out a couple of artifact lands, [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) , [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) . He obviously didn’t have [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast) as he tapped out for [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) . You could almost sense the relief from the Finn when his teammate [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) ed the [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) on turn two instead of bringing in the game-ending legendary spirit.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcop05/qf_pasi.jpg)*Pasi Virtanen.*
Boros Deck Wins seems pretty good against affinity even without Kataki as it has an absolute ton of removal. Valori didn’t seem to be using his optimally as Virtanen got to bounce modular counters around.


It didn’t seem to make a difference. Kill an [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) , sac it to Ravager in response. [Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purge) Ravager, move the counters onto Nexus. [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage) Nexus.


A [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) revealed a hand of [Flametongue Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) , [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart) and [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) .


[Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) found Virtanen a pair of Workers, which both went down in flames. Finally he got a [Myr Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) to stick. It was only temporary. Kataki came out to tie up Virtanen’s mana, a [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) and Lavamancer shifted the Enforcer, leaving the way clear for the [Flametongue Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) to smash through.


“This matchup is horrible,” Virtanen explained. “In all the games I’ve played I’ve not won one yet.”


Kim Valori beats Pasi Virtanen 2-0.
