Since the start of the game you and your opponent have been slugging it out to the point where you are both out of gas. You draw your card for the turn and it's an Azure Mage (from the [***Magic** 2012* Card Image Gallery](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2012/cig)). You cast it, draw a bunch of cards with it, and ultimately bury your opponent with your replenished hand.

Easy game, right?
