MTGO Convention Series – All Access Returns September 15
--------------------------------------------------------


Want to join in on the fun of PAX, Gen Con, or Origins while playing from home? Want to try out almost all the cards available on *Magic Online* for up to a week at a time? Just like last year, MTGO is running a special series of tournaments hosted by the team at Pastimes Events.


Starting tomorrow, September 15, at 10 a.m. Pacific (17:00 UTC), purchase a Gen Con entry package at [www.pastimesevents.com/digitalchamps](https://pastimesevents.com/digitalchamps/) for $20 and receive a code for redeeming inside *Magic Online*. When you redeem your code, you receive:


* A **Mythic Event Token** usable for entry into one of the 28 Constructed events held during the four days of the convention.
* **All Access** to cards in *Magic Online* until Wednesday at 10 a.m. Pacific following the convention—build a deck and enter games without having the cards in your collection!
	+ *All Access excludes* Battlebond*,* Secret Lair*, and old-frame Power Nine.*
	+ Enter any number of casual games at no cost.
	+ Leagues, queues, and scheduled events still require paying an entry option to join.

Play three rounds in a Convention Event and earn up to nine booster packs plus a pair of Convention Series-exclusive promos—a **Xanathar** avatar and a non-foil **Demilich**.


*NOTE: Each event has a cap of 56 players, and unused Mythic Event Tokens will be removed from accounts once All Access for that convention ends.*


![Xanathar Avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Xanathar.JPG)![Demelich promo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Demelich%20promo.JPG)


If you win three matches in a single Convention Event, you will earn a Wizards Ticket good for entry into the **Convention Series Championship** on Saturday, January 1. Full prizes will be announced later, but the winner of that event will receive four digital sets of every Modern-legal set on *Magic Online*! *(You can earn multiple Wizards Tickets as prizes over the four conventions, but you will only get to enter the Championship once.)*


There will be three more conventions supported this way during the remainder of 2021:





| Convention | All-Access Period *(10 a.m.*–***10 a.m.)*** | Event Dates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ~~PAX West~~ | ~~September 1–8~~ | ~~September 3–6~~ |
| Gen Con | September 15\*–22 | September 16–19 |
| Origins | September 29–October 6 | September 30–October 3 |
| PAX Unplugged | December 8–15\* | December 9–12 |


\*All Access begins following downtime on September 15. All Access ends at downtime on December 15.


Pastimes will also be running SpellTable Commander events that will give out booster prizes on *Magic Online* at scheduled times each day of the convention.


For full information on the Convention Series, including event schedules for each of the formats, please visit [www.pastimesevents.com/digitalchamps](https://pastimesevents.com/digitalchamps/).

Showcase Challenge Weekends
---------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Set Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, September 18, we have the Pauper Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT, and on Sunday, September 19, we have the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT. Then next week on Saturday, September 25, we have the Modern Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT, and on Sunday, September 26, we finish things off with the Pioneer Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT. Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in December.
