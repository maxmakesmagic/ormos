It's very nearly time for [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk), because [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) is back, as is [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall). Soon, you'll get to make the most of the Moxes.


The anticipation is killing even us, so to kick off *Vintage Masters* Week, we're already looking ahead to the Prerelease, which begins this Friday, June 13, at 10 a.m., and continues on through Monday, June 16.


The Prerelease will feature a host of Draft events, plus Swiss Sealed, each one a new opportunity to open one of the Power Nine. But while the powerful cards doled out in *Vintage Masters*'s [Special rarity](/en/articles/archive/vintage-masterss-special-rarity-2014-05-12-0) grab the headlines, there are plenty of other cool cards that make the set *worth* checking out.


Pun intended.

Just for participating in the *Vintage Masters* Prerelease you'll receive a promo [Magister of Worth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magister+of+Worth), a card recently released in *Conspiracy*, but also featured in *Vintage Masters*. You can also receive the [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) and [Dack Fayden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dack+Fayden) Avatars for participating in Prerelease and Release events, respectively.
