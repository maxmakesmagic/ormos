 5. [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler)



 In *Khans of Tarkir* sealed, you're looking to stretch your mana to get your most powerful effects without giving up too much in the way of consistency. Small wonder, then, that so many [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler)s popped up in decks that got their pilots into Day 2. It asks very little, just a single mana outside of your clan (unless you've got the Mardu), and is a perfectly functional [Gray Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Ogre) until you find it. Once it's face-up it ends the game in a hurry. All through Day 1 we saw players touching a fourth or even a fifth color to get access to powerul morphs.
