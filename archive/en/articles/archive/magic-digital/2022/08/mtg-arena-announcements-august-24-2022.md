*Arena Cube*: Now until September 1
===================================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/9pge4rjxdph.jpg)


The latest [*Arena Cube* is going on right now](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtg-arena-cube-draft-card-list) and continuing until September 1 at 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC). In this event, you open and pass around packs like a typical draft, only the card pool isn't a single *Magic* set but rather a selection of some of the best cards available in *MTG Arena*! Both Best-of-One and Best-of-Three matches are available. This is a Phantom event, so you don't get to keep the cards you draft, but you do keep the gold and Historic individual card rewards you can win!


[Visit the *Dominaria United Arena Cube* page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtg-arena-cube-draft-card-list) to see the rewards and all the cards in the cube pool!

The Next Year of *Magic* and *MTG Arena*
========================================


Last week, Wizards Presents gave us our first look at what's planned for the next year of *Magic*, and beyond. You can read, watch, reread, or rewatch everything we announced [in our recap article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/next-year-of-magic-wizards-presents-2022-08-18). Here are some finer details specific to *MTG Arena*:


*MTG Arena* will support all the announced Standard-legal sets, including the epilogue set *March of the Machine: The Aftermath*.


From *Universes Beyond*, *The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth™* will be available on *MTG Arena*. We intend for this set to launch "true-to-tabletop" with no card rebalances or digital-only mechanics, and it will be playable in Alchemy and Historic formats.
