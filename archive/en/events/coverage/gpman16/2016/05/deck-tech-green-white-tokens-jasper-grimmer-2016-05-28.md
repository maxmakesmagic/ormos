The name Jasper Grimmer may not mean much to you, but the up-and-coming player from Germany already reached the Top 8 of a Grand Prix three times before, and regularly makes our shortlist of players to watch. This weekend, he had brought one of Standard's standards in Green-White Tokens.


"I've been playing the deck ever since the Pro Tour. I strongly believe having a deck that you know inside and out is the most important thing in Standard," Grimmer explained. "Because in Standard matchups are very close, in the 45 to 55 percent range mostly, rarely up to 60/40, nothing like, for instance, in Legacy where you get some 70/30 matchups. So knowing your deck and being able to pilot it optimally has a much greater influence on your win percentage than actually having the optimal deck.


"That's why I decided to settle on a deck as early as possible. So I figured, yeah, why not pick the Pro Tour champion's," said Grimmer. Of course, that list was only the beginning and changed somewhat during the following weeks of testing and tuning. Grimmer was quick to point out the value even of minor improvements, although in this case he replaced about eight cards from Steve Rubin's PT winning list.

*Jasper Grimmer*



Grimmer was an early adopter of [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist) and [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone), for example, which were missing from Rubin's main deck. "Both of these inclusions seem to be the consensus nowadays," said Grimmer. "I guess everyone realized you simply need the Declaration. It's not just that you want more removal than just [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command), but also that [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) can't handle a lot of problematic cards, especially if you don't have an active [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar); [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) is a problem, killing [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) with the Command is sometimes hard and always a bad trade, and killing [Ormendahl, Profane Prince](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ormendahl%2C+Profane+Prince) is obviously impossible."


The addition of [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist) was a little trickier. "The beauty of the original deck was that it was almost immune to −4/−4, whether in the form of [Grasp of Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness) or [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish). The tokens would die, but [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) and [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) would remain and rebuild; [Thraben Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector) and [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) leave behind their artifact tokens; and you could often hold back [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) until it was 4/5," Grimmer explained. "I think, in the Pro Tour Top 8, Seth Manfield even took out [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) when sideboarding against Rubin."


On the flip side, [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist) gave the deck more play both against aggressive Human decks and against control strategies. "You just need one activation of [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) or one [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to turn the Pacifist into an interventionist. And it's quite important to be able to put some pressure on planeswalkers early, in the mirror and elsewhere. Also, control players can't just pass their turn to keep up mana for a counter or a removal spell anymore."


Grimmer had played four copies of [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist) for a while, but shortly before the Grand Prix he removed one and went down to two [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker)s to make room for a [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and a [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker). "I've always been impressed with [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) after sideboarding, so much so that I wanted to try it out in the main deck. Obviously, the card is much better post-sideboard when games go longer and center on attrition."


Other cards Grimmer considered to be possible cuts were [Secure the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secure+the+Wastes) and the third [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa). "I have played the deck on *Magic Online* almost everyday for weeks now, but I still haven't it all figured out yet. There are so many options ..."



 Nevertheless Grimmer did put up some minor results with the deck already, finishing in the Top 16 of the *Shadows over Innistrad* Standard Championship on *Magic Online* a week ago. "I wouldn't mind replicating that result this weekend," he said with a smile.
