Welcome to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Once again, nothing has changed.


If you're a newer reader to this column, you may be wondering exactly *why* nothing has changed. Simply, these rankings only change following Premier Events—Grand Prix and Pro Tours, for the most part—and we like to clear the decks around Prerelease time, which allows all of our players (even the best of the best) to get their hands on some *Battle for Zendikar* before it hits their local game stores. If you're a newer reader here, we should tell you that, to make up for all this inactivity, things in rankings land are about to get shaken up in the biggest way. We're only ten days away from the next Grand Prix action, and that means we're only two and a bit weeks away from [Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*](/node/403026), where an avalanche of Pro Points will be given out and almost everyone in the Top 25 will go up or go down—they rarely stay the same.


If you're a regular reader of this column, you know that the Top 25 only changes during Premier Events. If you're a regular reader, you know that a seismic shift is coming at Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*.


However long you've been reading this column, you'll be welcome back next week, right here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
