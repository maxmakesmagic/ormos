In our current version of the new-player experience, Sparky walks you through a few tutorial matches, rewards you with some decks, and then. . .kicks you into the deep end of the mana pool. Since*Magic: The Gathering*can be a pretty complex game, rewarding new players with a bunch of decks and then telling them to have fun against other players isn't always the easiest way to learn.


Well, Sparky's back, and this time she's not on your side of the battlefield.


Right now, you'll be able to queue up for Bot Matches in*MTG Arena*. Whether you're looking to try out a new deck or simply brush up on your skills, Sparky is here to offer a helping hand (or rather, hand-like manifestation of a Planewalker's latent power) to every player in*MTG Arena*. And if you happen to be one of our newer players, you'll be able to use practice matches to gain experience, level up, and progress toward mastering how to play*Magic: The Gatherin*g.
