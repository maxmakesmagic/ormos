 Just because you've made it to the Top 8 of a Pro Tour doesn't mean you're playing for the same thing as your opponent. While winning it is, as always, the goal of every player it's become more and more important to consider what else comes along with victory: World Championship slots, World *Magic* Cup captainship, and Pro Players Club benefits create victories that mean more than "just" a Pro Tour trophy.




**The Players**



If you hadn't heard of 20th-ranked William Jensen yet this season, you've been living under a rock. The former Pro Tour player had returned to the game around his induction into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame, and embarked on a journey that's demonstrated his skill is more than worth of the game's hallowed few. Setting a new seasonal Grand Prix Top 8 record with eight this season, doubling his previous lifetime total, he's been on a march that earned him Platinum status in the Pro Players Club and, now, a potential seat at this year's World Championship.



 Pierre Mondon has been heating up this season, with a Top 8 at Grand Prix Philadelphia and win at Grand Prix Oklahoma City. With his qualification for Pro Tour *Magic*2015 coming from that Top 8 it's been some time since he's played at the Pro Tour, but it hadn't stopped him from finding his first Top 8 there as well. While just Top 100 would have earned him Silver status – good enough for an invite to Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir– he is after much more returning to the venue for the Sunday stage.




**The Decks**




 Jensen, like many of his teammates, brought White-Black Midrange to bear this weekend. With plenty of removal at its disposal, it works to maintain control of the battlefield until [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa), or [Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council) lets it pull away with the win. Cards like [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) and [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) are just two of the many ways the white half of the deck complements the dominating power of [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) and [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s.




 Mondon's Jund Planeswalkers was a deck he picked up from *Magic Online*. After finding success in Daily Events, Mondon decided to take it to the Pro Tour. With a 9-1 Constructed record going into the Top 8, it was a choice that worked out well for him. By casting powerful spells, including Planeswalkers such as [Vraska the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska+the+Unseen) and [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) with removal and [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return) to answer aggression and control, Mondon marched through decks of all types Friday and Saturday.






*No. 20 Ranked Player William Jensen was looking for a win to cap off an incredible season with White-Black Midrange. Pierre Mondon, however, was playing for Platinum with Jund Planeswalkers.*
