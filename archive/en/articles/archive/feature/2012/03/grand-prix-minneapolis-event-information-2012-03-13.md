**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard](/en/node/704561)
* Deck lists are required.
* Each Player must use the same deck on Day 2 that he or she used on Day 1.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

Transit from the Minneapolis airport to the downtown area is very easy and inexpensive. Visit [metrotransit.org/light-rail.aspx](http://metrotransit.org/light-rail.aspx) and enter your travel schedule leaving MSP traveling to Minneapolis Convention Center (or whatever hotel you are going to). There are a couple options: take the light rail to the Downtown/Nicollet Mall Station and walk approximately 7 blocks to the Convention Center (Highly recommended if it's a nice day!) or the transit site will give you a number of options for combining rail and bus to take you right to the Convention Center. Fares are typically around $2.
