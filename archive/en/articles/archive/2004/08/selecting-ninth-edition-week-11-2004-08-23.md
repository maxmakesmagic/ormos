We're in the eleventh week of [Selecting *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/home), and soon we’ll be all done. If you haven’t jumped in to vote yet, your chances are running out! Last week’s card vote was the duel of discard, pitting [Blackmail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackmail+)  against [Addle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Addle).

**[Blackmail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackmail) takes it in a close one!**

### Card Vote #11


This week’s card vote is between [Animal Magnetism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animal+Magnetism) and [Weird Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weird+Harvest). Neither of these are tournament staples, but they both offer very powerful effects. [Animal Magnetism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animal+Magnetism) offers green an alternative way to get your giant monsters into play but it’s a specialized effect that needs some planning to work best. [Weird Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weird+Harvest) also offers a powerful specialized effect. The challenge to this one is its symmetrical nature, if your opponent has creatures, that is! Both are Onslaught rares that haven’t made it into the core set (yet). Pick your favorite, and the one with the most votes gets printed in *Ninth Edition*!
