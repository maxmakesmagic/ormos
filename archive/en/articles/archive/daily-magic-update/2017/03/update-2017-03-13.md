The March 13, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 13, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by no changes.


What People Are Talking About

This one is included because it's the most adorable tweet I saw on the [banned and restricted announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/march-13-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-03-13). That's how you get in the Daily *Magic* Update, boys and girls.


I want to also note that one discussion point cropping up this morning was that we didn't mention Legacy or Pauper in our explanation. This wasn't nefarious or an indication that we don't look at those formats (we do and did), they simply were not the ones we felt needed any explanation at the moment. For anyone who has been following our B&R announcements the past few years, we typically don't explain anything when we make no changes. It's when we do make changes that we talk about the health of the affected formats. For this one, we tried something different: opening up our thought process a bit to show where we were at on some key formats that have been on people's minds—Standard due to the factors mentioned in the article, Vintage because we've been hearing from the Vintage community directly, and Modern, because it's on everyone's mind with *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*.


In other words, the explanation wasn't a reflection of how we feel about Legacy and Pauper—it was a reflection of how much we thought needed to be said about possible changes to those formats at this time. For Legacy and Pauper, that amounted to basically "We're good, yo."

I mean, I could have included the main tweet about Corey Baumeister winning [Grand Prix New Jersey](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj17), but his brother's response is pretty fantastic.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. Top Grand Prix Moments

With two overlapping Grand Prix over the weekend, there were plenty of moments worth noting.


* Grand Prix New Jersey [Top 5 Moments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj17/top-5-moments-2017-03-12) | Meghan Wolff
* Grand Prix Barcelona [Top 5 Moments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbar17/top-5-moments-2017-03-12) | Tobi Henke

If you want to dive deeper, you should check out the reams of video coverage from both tournaments this weekend on the [twitch.tv/magic archive page](https://www.twitch.tv/magic/videos/all).


1. [StarCityGames.com Dallas Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/110317_dallas.html)

Austin Bursavich walked away with the trophy, piloting [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) over Trent Avera's Burn list in the finals. Check out the [Top 32 decklists](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=03/09/2017&end_date=03/12/2017&start=1&finish=32&event_ID=47&city=Dallas), or re-live the weekend from their [Twitch archive page](https://www.twitch.tv/scgtour/videos/all).


1. [Sygg, River Cutthroat EDH Deck Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEvbq1HMYoE&feature=youtu.be) | TheMagicManSam

TheMagicManSam typically focuses on art, but he's added Commander deck techs to his repertoire, and in this video he covers—well, it's in the title. Watch below.

1. [A Guide to Gisa and Geralf Zombie Tribal EDH / Commander for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wecKfapLgno) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

A high-quality, fun, and entertaining video, to be sure, but I'm also including this so we can congratulate the Professor on 200,000 YouTube subscribers. So—congratulations!

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [God of Magic: An Interview with Richard Garfield](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34714_God-Of-Magic-An-Interview-With-Richard-Garfield.html) | StarCityGames.com | Jeff Cunningham

Though originally published earlier this month, this interview with Richard Garfield was made free on the Select side of StarCityGames.com today, and combined its former two parts into a one-parter. If you read only one article featuring the creator of *Magic: The Gathering* today, make it this one.


1. [Much Abrew: Splendid Landfall (Standard)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/much-abrew-splendid-landfall-standard?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Variations of this deck have been around for a while, but [Walking Ballista](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista) has certainly given [Retreat to Hagra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retreat+to+Hagra) a new dimension. I've toyed around with versions of this deck a bit, and it's certainly a fun, interesting deck that can do a lot of crazy things.


1. [60-Card Shootout: Standard Four-Color Copy Cat](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/benfriedman-03132017-60-card-shootout-standard-four-color-saheeli-v2/) | Gathering Magic | Ben Friedman

I always like to reward the called shots. This isn't the exact decklist Friedman used to make the finals of Grand Prix New Jersey, but it's close. And he clearly had this in the can before he went off and crushed a Grand Prix. So good on you, Ben Friedman. Good on you.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Corey Baumeister's Four-Color Copy Cat](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj17/top-8-decklists-2017-03-12)

Congratulations to ~~Brad Nelson's brother~~ Corey Baumeister for winning [Grand Prix New Jersey](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj17)! Looks like we have another Standard savant in the family!


Oh, and for good measure, Petr Sochůrek won with a very similar 75 over at [Grand Prix Barcelona](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbar17/top-8-decks-grand-prix-barcelona-2017-2017-03-12). Just because we didn't ban anything today, doesn't mean we haven't taken note of this development.
