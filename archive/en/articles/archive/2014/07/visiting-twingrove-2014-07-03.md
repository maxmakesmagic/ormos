There's an idea I keep coming back do that many of you share too: Lands are where it's at in Commander.

 We've [talked about lands before](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ct/250) in Commander and today isn't about them again in as much as specific lands matter more than others for today's [*Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-2015-core-set-card-set-archive-products-game-info) preview.



We'll get to that in just a moment. I have a story.



 One of my earliest decks for Commander was built around [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa). It was the deck that pushed me in the direction of a token-focused deck (since making all of my lands creatures and [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)ning two or three times typically ended things in short order) and showed me how powerful a monocolored deck could be.



Among the ways to maximize making mana and activating Kamahl numerous times, I found a few cards that naturally lent themselves to a mean, green deck:



* [Early Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Early+Harvest) untapped nearly all of my lands for just three mana.
* [Coiling Woodworm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coiling+Woodworm) could typically trade with the biggest creatures on the battlefield and fueled [Greater Good](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Good) action.
* [Dauntless Dourbark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Dourbark), [Uktabi Wildcats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uktabi+Wildcats), and [Dungrove Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungrove+Elder) were cheap, huge fatties that pick up Equipment well.
* [Hall of Gemstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hall+of+Gemstone) routinely broke more colorful decks, setting up big turns and providing a *de facto* shield against [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)-type cards.
