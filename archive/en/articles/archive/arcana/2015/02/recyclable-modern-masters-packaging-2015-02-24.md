We're doing something new and pretty cool for the upcoming *Modern Masters* *2015 Edition*, and I don't just mean reprinting Modern-format staples in an awesome draft environment. Although we're doing that too.



What I do mean is that we're exploring a recyclable packaging material for our booster products with this year's *Modern Masters* release.



The packaging, the back of which you can see below (we’re not ready to show you the front just yet), is 100% Forest Stewardship Council-certified paperboard, which is a very official sounding way of saying the booster packaging can be recycled just like any other piece of cardboard.

We'll only be rolling out this recyclable product in English version of the product. Chinese (Simplified) and Japanese product will be sold in the traditional flow wrap.
