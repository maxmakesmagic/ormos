Aaron is a new player who only started at the *Mirrodin* prerelease, Where as Tom is an old hand having made top8 in this event two years ago. Coverage of Tom's draft can be found [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/live-coverage-2004-english-national-championship-2004-06-26-2)
### Game 1


Thing start badly as he has to mulligan first a 6 land hand then a 3 [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) 2 red card 1 equipment opener. Tom manages a [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) and a Viridian Lorebearer while Aaron applies pressure with a [Nim Abomination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Abomination) and a [Lose Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lose+Hope) on Tom's Myr. With only five cards Tom struggles to find a 4th land only making Horned helm and [Vulshok Morningstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Morningstar). Aaron has a number of 1/1s including a Krark Clan Shaman a [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) and a [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus). He dropped a [Nemesis Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis+Mask) and used to force though damage at the cost of a guy a turn. Tom tried to race but just couldn't find land and a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) finished him off.


### Game 2


Both players keep 7 this time. Tom looks to start the beatdown on turn 2 with a [Viridian Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Zealot), but [Lose Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lose+Hope) was the perfect answer. An [Energy Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Chamber) from Aaron threatened to turn his 1/1s into real threats but After it build two counters up on itself Tom was able to [Dismantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismantle) it and improved his [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) to 3/3. However he seem to have no real creatures with a [Sylvok Explorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Explorer) joining the [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr). When the 3/3 Myr was [Barbed Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Lightning) the game was stalled out. Tom still had no action and was dismayed to see his opponent tap 7 mana and was a bit relived to see it was only a [Nim Grotesque](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Grotesque) with only one artifact plus a [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus). However it proved to be rather powerful when Aaron made and equipped it with a [Whispersilk Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak) and attack for 7 with it and the [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus). Tom having not drawn any of his artifact kill drew and scooped. 


Final score 2-0 to Aaron Cadwallader
