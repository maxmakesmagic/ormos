If you are like me you have been checking the *Conflux*[Visual Spoiler](/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/conflux/spoiler) on a daily basis for the past few weeks to get your brain around the new cards that we will all be playing with at the [Prerelease](/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) this weekend. I don't know about you but I have never been able to get my head around a list of cards quite the same way as I can with that tantalizing visual buffet of cards that have been previewed on this site, different magazines, blogs, columns, and the mysterious "various sources."

One thing that immediately leaps out from the revealed cards is that players will be able to reap big time rewards for stretching their mana bases to the breaking point. The Visual Spoiler shows off five different cards with all five colors of mana in their mana cost and another three that have activated abilities that cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif). Without a doubt the card that is most intriguing to me is the Maelstrom Archangel. It gives me the same funny feeling I got when I first got an advance peek at [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) on the *Scourge* spoiler.
