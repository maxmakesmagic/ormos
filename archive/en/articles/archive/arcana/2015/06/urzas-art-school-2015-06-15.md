Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






If you watched much of Grand Prix Charlotte this past weekend, chances are good that you spotted players playing Red-Green Tron on camera at some point. As one of the most successful big mana decks in the format—heck, one of the most successful decks in the format, full stop—the Tron deck has plenty of fans and adherents.


For the fans of the Tron—so named because getting all three in play is called the "Urzatron" by many players—one of the signatures of their deck is having the "right" selection of lands. And since the three Urza lands were printed in *Antiquities*, *Fifth Edition*, *Eighth Edition*, and *Ninth Edition*, players have some choices.


While I’m writing this ahead of Grand Prix Charlotte, I think it’s safe to assume that the commentators will have, at some point, remarked on the art and expansion chosen for a player’s Urza lands. So today I thought we’d take a look at the art descriptions (and the art) for the *Ninth Edition* versions. Some of these descriptions also came from *Eighth Edition*, which used some of the same art.


**Urza’s Mine**

[Urza's Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83314) | Art by [Brian Snoddy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Brian%20Snoddy%22%5d)


Color: None (land)


This land card represents a magical mine (like coal mine, not land mine) where pure mana is forcibly extracted from the earth by artifacts. The mine is the third in a trio that also includes a tower and a fantasy version of a power plant.


**Urza’s Tower**

[Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83316) | Art by [Brian Snoddy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Brian%20Snoddy%22%5d)


Color: None (land)


This land card represents a huge, ornate tower. It should have the same look/feel as the Mine and Power Plant.


**Urza’s Power Plant**

Color: None (land)


This land card represents a magical "power plant"—a generator that creates pure mana.
