We totalled up the number of lands being played in all the decks during the OBC portion of worlds. There ended up being more Swamps than any other type of land, followed by Islands, Forests, and Plains. However, there were SEVEN non-basic land types which were more present in decks than Mountains! Clearly this shows that red wasn't a serious contender in this field.
