We're into July, and it's time for our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. What's the significance of July? We're into the last month of the season, and that means the rankings coming closer and closer to the end of the Player of the Year race. With Silver, Gold, and Platinum status on the line, our pros have been busy racking up the air miles around the world. Let's see how they did last weekend.



South America always delivers when it comes to exciting Grand Prix action, and [Buenos Aires in Argentina](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbue15) gave us a full weekend of Standard action. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa narrowly missed out on a Top 8 finish, and players finishing ninth are often *very* disappointed. Not Paulo, on this occasion, as his finish earns him Platinum status, as well as a bump up the rankings to No. 16. Craig Wescoe is now at No. 22, following his seventeenth-place finish in Argentina, while Willy Edel now finds himself on the trapdoor at No. 25, despite a Top 32 finish.



Still with Constructed, but this time in Modern, [Grand Prix Singapore](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsin15) was the second of our doubleheader weekend. Of the Top 25, only Lee Shi Tian and Alexander Hayne managed to get into the points, with Lee at 31st and Hayne at 37th. Yuuki Ichikawa, Jacob Wilson, Yuuya Watanabe, and William Jensen all failed to add to their totals. There was, however, a major rankings winner in Singapore, and it's the player who only just fell out of the Top 25— Reid Duke. His fourth place in Singapore sees him re-enter the chart at No. 19 and takes him much closer to his goal of once again being a Platinum Pro.



Next up is another busy weekend of action, with [Montréal in Canada](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-montreal-2015) playing host to Limited action, while one of the highlights of the European Grand Prix calendar takes place, the Legacy [GP in Lille, France](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-lille-2015). Join us next week for all the latest news from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
