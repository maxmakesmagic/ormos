Many of you have been eagerly anticipating the exact date of our next Announcement Day, and we've been a bit cagey about it for a while. And the reason we've been so cagey is that it's more of an Announcement *Week*.


Here's what's happening: every day next week through Friday at Grand Prix Las Vegas, we'll have some kind of major news or announcement.


On Monday, Mark Rosewater will discuss a slate of changes we'll be making to our sets going forward. You won't want to miss this one!


On Tuesday, we'll have two items you should pay attention toâ€”one is about our *Magic* digital offerings coming up and the other is the banned and restricted announcement that was originally scheduled for June 14.


We are moving the B&R announcement up because Wednesday is going to be what you would traditionally think of as Announcement Day, where we announce a ton of upcoming new products and worlds. Since we're focusing on everything we're putting out for our 25th anniversary next year, we want to give this announcement its own day for you to discuss, dissect, and dive into.


Thursday is the start of Grand Prix Las Vegas, but it's also a day for a (relatively) small Organized Play announcement. We've got a really cool thing set up for 2018 that players have requested for a long time, and you'll hear more about it on Thursday!


Finally, Friday we'll be turning our attention to *Hour of Devastation*, and you will be able to see preview cards on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). We'll have action coming from Las Vegas followed by more on DailyMTG Friday evening. So pay attention!


All of the announcements Monday through Friday will come at 8 a.m. on DailyMTG. Friday, watch for the *Hour of Devastation* party to kick off in the evening on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


Stay tuned! It's going to be a big week!
