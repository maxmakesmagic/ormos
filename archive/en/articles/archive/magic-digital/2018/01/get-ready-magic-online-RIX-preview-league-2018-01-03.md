If you've never watched a LoadingReadyRun Pre-Prerelease, you should. Well-known community members get together with the LoadingReadyRun team to preview the upcoming set one week before you can experience it at your local game store. You can check out the *Rivals of Ixalan* Pre-Prerelease on the [LoadingReadyRun Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun) on January 5 at 11 a.m. PT.


But what does this have to do with *Magic Online*, you might be asking? Well, what if you wanted to see even *more* of the new set? What if you wanted to watch some of your favorite *Magic Online* streamers play the new format? What if you even wanted to try it out for yourself before you head to your local game store? Well, next week, *Magic Online* has you covered!


On January 11, starting at 10 a.m. PT, *Magic Online* will host the *Rivals of Ixalan* Preview League, a 24-hour Sealed Deck league where you can experience *Rivals of Ixalan* before heading to your local game store for the official Prerelease. This limited-time league will be open to all players and feature a friendly prize structure where not only do all players get to keep their cards, but each player also wins at least one *Rivals of Ixalan* booster pack! The full event details are below.


Additionally, many of your favorite streamers will be taking part in the *Rivals of Ixalan* Preview League during this time. They'll be streaming on their own channels, but we'll also be hosting them on our channel, [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), during this time. You can see the schedule for hosted streams here (all times are PT):

| 3 | 1% | 8% | 0% | 91% |

And here is the list of the Curated changes:
