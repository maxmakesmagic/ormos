Showcase Challenge Weekend

Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a future Championship invitation.


On Saturday, January 29, we have the Vintage Showcase Challenge at 10 a.m. PT (18:00 UTC), and on Sunday, January 30, we finish things off with the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT (16:00). Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in April.

Saturday Legacy Challenge – Change to Small Structure
-----------------------------------------------------


After considering player feedback and play data, we are changing the structure of the Legacy Challenge on Saturdays only starting this week. The Challenge that starts at 4 a.m. Pacific time each Saturday will be converted from a Large Challenge *(64-player minimum, prizes to Top 64)* to a Small Challenge *(32-player minimum, prizes to Top 32)*. This event will be labeled "Legacy Challenge 32" inside the game client.


Legacy Challenges held Sundays at 8 a.m. are not affected—this event will continue to be labeled "Legacy Challenge" inside the game client.

*Magic Online* Format Challenges Every Weekend
----------------------------------------------


Format Challenges are the first step toward qualifying for Premier Play through your favorite *Magic* formats and provide excellent prizes for those looking to test their mettle in their favorite formats. [Learn more about Premier Play qualification](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2021) to get started today.


*Magic Online*'s Format Challenges run once on Saturdays and once on Sundays for each Constructed format! On weekends featuring Showcase Challenge events, the Format Challenge that starts at either 6 a.m., 8 a.m., or 10 a.m. Pacific time is pre-empted by the Showcase Challenge—Format Challenges scheduled at other times remain in place.


*NOTES:* 


* *Pauper and Standard Challenges are never pre-empted.*
* *Saturday Legacy Challenges require 32 players and give prizes to Top 32.*
* *Sunday Legacy Challenges require 64 players and give prizes to Top 64.*
