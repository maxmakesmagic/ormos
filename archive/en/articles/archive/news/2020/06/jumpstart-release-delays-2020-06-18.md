Due to complications related to COVID-19, we are facing further delays with regards to the availability of *Jumpstart* product outside of North America. This includes the packs intended for the *Core Set 2021* Buy-a-Box promotion. As of now, we do not have a new release date to share, but we will be sure to communicate it as information becomes available.


*Jumpstart*'s release in North America is currently on track for July 17. Players and stores in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Japan might noticeÂ some delays, but retailers in those regions can sell *Jumpstart* as soon as it arrives in their stores after July 17. We expect a rolling release schedule outside of North America.


Thank you for your patience and understanding in these very challenging times.
