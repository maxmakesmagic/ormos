The Pro Tour is about to return to Paris for **Magic** Weekend, but first let's take a look back at the Pro Tour's last Paris stop, the [2006 World Championships](/en/events/coverage/mihara-dutch-crowned-world-champions) held at (okay, near) the Louvre. Then-relative-unknown deck designer Guillaume Wafo-Tapa burst onto the scene with this unusual control deck, going 5-1 in the Standard rounds and establishing himself as one of the game's foremost control players and deck designers. Wafo-Tapa's friend and namemate Guillaume Matignon will be battling Brad Nelson for the Player of the Year title in Paris this weekend, and it's likely that the two Guillaumes worked together on Matignon's Standard deck for that playoff. What did they brew up? Tune in to [**Magic** Weekend](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/magicweekend/paris11) coverage this weekend to find out!
