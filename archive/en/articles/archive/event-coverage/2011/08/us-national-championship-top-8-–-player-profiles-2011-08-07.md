![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/usnat11/t8%20mccleod.jpg)**Name**: James McLeod  
  
**Age**: 19  
  
**Hometown**: Fuquay-Varina, NC  
  
**Number of GP/PT Top 8s?**? 0  
  
**Record by format:** Standard: 6-2, Draft: 5-1  
  
**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**  Pyromancer Ascension. I felt it had good matchups on most of the field.  
  
**What colors did you draft?** UB aggro with two Mind Controls then RB Bloodthirst.  
  
**How important is it to be on the National team with Worlds in the United States this year?** Pretty important. The U.S. has to win that team trophy this year!  
  
**What do you think the biggest impact of the recent changes to Standard was?** Forcing people to add the "picking a deck for the metagame" skill to their toolbox instead of just grinding CawBlade mirror matches.  
  
**What do you think the most powerful archetype is in *M12* draft?** Probably any deck with Mind Control. Other decks are competitive, but not on the same level.

**Age**: 30  
  
**Hometown**: Houston, TX  
  
**Number of GP/PT Top 8s?**? 0  
  
**Record by format:** Standard:6-2, Draft: 6-0  
  
**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**  CawBlade. I was given the deck by my friend David Thomas, who got an updated list from Gerry Thompson in the last minute. Gerry is a really good player.  
  
**What colors did you draft?** BR and UB. I draft a lot on **Magic** Online and sometimes post my draftcaps on texasmagiczone.com under phuqdao.  
  
**How important is it to be on the National team with Worlds in the United States this year?** Kind of important. Maybe a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.  
  
**What do you think the biggest impact of the recent changes to Standard was?** I don’t really play much Standard, so I can’t give an in-depth answer. If you look at the results, the changes made very little difference.  
  
**What do you think the most powerful archetype is in *M12* draft?** I have no idea. Personally, I just like to draft whatever is open. Getting ate picks is a lot more important than being in an archetype. Although Wizards is getting better at designing synergistic Limited formats overall, core sets are still core sets.

**Age**: 22  
  
**Hometown**: West Allis  
  
**Number of GP/PT Top 8s?**? 8 GP +8  
  
**Record by format:** Standard: 6-2, Draft: 5-1  
  
**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**  CawBlade, duh.  
  
**What colors did you draft?** UR and GB.  
  
**How important is it to be on the National team with Worlds in the United States this year?** It would be a pretty huge honor to represent the U.S. at Worlds. I want to be on the team really bad, more than I can describe. It’s really cool.  
  
**What do you think the biggest impact of the recent changes to Standard was?** There is less CawBlade in the field now and more free wins.  
  
**What do you think the most powerful archetype is in *M12* draft?** GB with 5 Greater Basilisks

**Age**: 30  
  
**Hometown**: Hayward, CA  
  
**Number of GP/PT Top 8s?**? 2 GP / 0 PT  
  
**Record by format:** Standard: 6-1-1 Draft: 6-0  
  
**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**  CawBlade. It rewards good play and is quite resilient.  
  
**What colors did you draft?** UB and RB.  
  
**How important is it to be on the National team with Worlds in the United States this year?** More important than normal because defending the home turf is a big game.  
  
**What do you think the biggest impact of the recent changes to Standard was?** Creature decks became more viable.  
  
**What do you think the most powerful archetype is in *M12* draft?** White-based fliers. White is the deepest and has a lot of fliers. With cards like Stormfront Pegasus, Griffin Riders, and Griffins, white-based flier decks can open with brutally fast draws.

**Age**: 18  
  
**Hometown**: Eureka, CA  
  
**Number of GP/PT Top 8s?**? 0  
  
**Record by format:** Standard: 7-1, Draft: 2-1, 2-1  
  
**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**  CawBlade, because Alex Bertoncini convinced me to play it and the Holla-twins were playing it.  
  
**What colors did you draft?** RB ad UR.  
  
**How important is it to be on the National team with Worlds in the United States this year?** I think it’s pretty important because you get to represent your entire country against the rest of the world.  
  
**What do you think the biggest impact of the recent changes to Standard was?** The fact that many decks were no longer obsolete and so much worse than CawBlade.  
  
**What do you think the most powerful archetype is in *M12* draft?** Probably RB Bloodthirst if you get the nuts or a deck with a lot of Griffins and Griffin Riders.

**Age**: 26

**Record by format:** Standard: 6-1-1 Draft: 5-1  
  
**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**  UW CawBlade. It’s the nuts!  
  
**What colors did you draft?** GR and GU  
  
**How important is it to be on the National team with Worlds in the United States this year?** It’s very important to me. I’ve always wanted to rep the U.S. with the best in the world! USA! USA! USA!  
  
**What do you think the biggest impact of the recent changes to Standard was?** Banning Stoneforge Mystic was right, but not Jace, the Mind Sculptor!  
  
**What do you think the most powerful archetype is in *M12* draft?** BR Bloodthirst. It’s very aggressive and it’s hard to stop.

**Age**: 28  
  
**Hometown**: Oakland, CA  
  
**Number of GP/PT Top 8s?**? 7 GP, 4 PT  
  
**Record by format:** Standard: 7-0-1 Draft: 4-2  
  
**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**  CawBlade, because it’s still really good, though much worse than before.  
  
**What colors did you draft?** WR and BUG (I had to keep it fair to each color)  
  
**How important is it to be on the National team with Worlds in the United States this year?** It’s awesome regardless, and with Worlds ten minutes from my house, I’d especially like to be on the team!  
  
**What do you think the biggest impact of the recent changes to Standard was?** CawBlade is now a beatable deck, and people can actually pick from a variety of good decks.  
  
**What do you think the most powerful archetype is in *M12* draft?** Bloodthirst Aggro.
