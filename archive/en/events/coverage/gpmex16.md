GRAND PRIX MEXICO CITY 2016
---------------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



There were 787 players who began the day at Grand Prix Mexico with hopes of finishing it unbeaten, but in the end only three managed to accomplish the feat: Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* champion Martin Dang and Rodrigo Goncalves Dos Santos finished undefeated at 9-0, while Jorge Padierna was hot on their heels with a final record of 8-0-1.


It’s a packed field right behind them, with several ranked players lurking behind Dang and Goncalves Dos Santos, among them No. 2 Seth Manfield, No. 8 Martin Muller, No. 17 Fabrizio Anteri, No. 18 Lee Shi Tian and No. 23 Joel Larsson.


There are 218 players qualified to return on Day 2 of Mexico’s largest-ever Grand Prix, and we’ll get our first look at the *Oath of the Gatewatch* when the players reconvene in the morning for six rounds of draft to determine the Top 8.
