M**agic: The Gathering–Tactics** is coming!


That's not the news. It's been coming for awhile. The real news is this: it's coming *tomorrow*. As you can see on [MagicTheGatheringTactics.com](http://www.magicthegatheringtactics.com/), it's coming out on January 18, 2011. And according to the dateline in the upper right of this page (the one you're reading right now), it's January 17 today. One day away!


**Magic: The Gathering–Tactics** is a 3D tactics game using **Magic** characters and concepts. You're already familiar with **Magic**, the trading card game. This is **Magic**, the tactics-style game!


Oh, and it's free to download and play. When it launches (tomorrow!), it will be for PC, but a Playstation 3 version will be along later in the year.


To get in as soon as possible, go to [MagicTheGatheringTactics.com](http://www.magicthegatheringtactics.com/) January 18, 2011. Tomorrow!
