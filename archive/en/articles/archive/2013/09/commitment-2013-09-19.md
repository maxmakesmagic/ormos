Commitment
==========



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)

Today I am going to talk about commitment.


There are different philosophies in deck building, of course. Some are super straightforward: Playing "the absolute best cards, or the best cards in your chosen color(s), regardless of synergy" is one philosophy, and has been a successful one. Picking nine or ten cards you like and playing four copies of all of those along with twenty to twenty-four lands is another; it has also been successful, especially in beatdown decks or other proactive strategies (although you will often be accused of playing a little-kid deck). These sorts of philosophies can rack up just as many big wins as seemingly more complicated ones... but they are not necessarily the most fun or mentally engaging.


Part of what makes **Magic** so addictive is the deck building element of synergy, and the inter-card dependencies that are implicit to synergy. I can still remember the moment, nearly twenty years ago, when it not only dawned on me that I should play my *Revised*-era [Kird Ape](javascript:void()) in a deck with Forests, but that there was such a thing as [Taiga](javascript:void()), and that all of these cards could link hairy arms and serve me as a sum greater than its individual parts (which was not a great leap for a 1/1 [Kird Ape](javascript:void())).


Decks relying on inter-card synergies require a bit more commitment to deck building than those with cards that all stand on their own. I am not talking about putting together a [Deceiver Exarch](javascript:void()) and a [Splinter Twin](javascript:void()). Not a combo.


I am talking about commitment.


Commitment to the *gang*.
