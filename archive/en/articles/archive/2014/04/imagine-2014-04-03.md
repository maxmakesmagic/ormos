Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 






Imagination is one of those nebulous things that is hard to pin down in art. Often, artists represent imagination in ways that are unusual or, well, awesome ways. In today's arcana we look at the blue Archetype:  [Archetype of Imagination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=+Archetype+of+Imagination). Where, in the art description, the creative team gives Robbie Trevino license to "add some awesomeness."
