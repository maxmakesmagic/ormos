 Chris is the copy editor for DailyMTG. If the Ts are dotted and the eyes are crossed, he dun goofed. 






This is it. The climactic finale. The Gatewatch (and loads of other Planeswalkers) facing off head-to-head against Nicol Bolas (and loads of other Planeswalkers).

Will the Multiverse be left reeling, forever under the thumb of a tyrannical overlord? Or will the Gatewatch thwart Bolas's plan and protect their friends, their families, their loved ones?


The first, best place to uncover the answer to this Multiverse-defining question is to read the complete story of *War of the Spark* in [*War of the Spark: Ravnica* by Greg Weisman](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/595014/war-of-the-spark-ravnica-magic-the-gathering-by-greg-weisman/9781984817457/). The novel will be released on April 23 and is available for preorder now!


What's that? You want more? Well I've got more for you!


Beginning on May 8, we'll be publishing six additional chapters written by Greg Weisman. These secret chapters follow the perspective of Rat, a brand-new character who plays a pivotal role in the narrative. Look for these chapters on DailyMTG and [MTGStory.com](https://magic.wizards.com/en/story), one story per week for six weeks.


Finally, don't forget to sign up for the [Random House newsletter](http://www.randomhousebooks.com/campaign/magic-gathering-newsletter/) to receive 20 free *War of the Spark* prequel stories by fantasy author Django Wexler! These stories will take place before the Gatewatch arrives back on Ravnica, and will be delivered straight to your inbox beginning in early June.


And there you have itâ€”that's all the places the story of *War of the Spark* will be told (not counting [the cards themselves](https://magic.wizards.com/articles/archive/war-spark-story-scenes-2019-04-01), of course). All that's left now is to read how the war for the fate of the Multiverse unfolds!
