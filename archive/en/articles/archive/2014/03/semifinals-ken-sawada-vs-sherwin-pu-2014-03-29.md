Pu and Sawada faced off in the first round of Day 2, where, according to Sawada, Pu crushed him 'Most rapidly'. Sawada headed into the semifinals hoping to avoid the same fate, but acknowledged the matchup was an uphill one. 



**Game 1**




 Sawada led things off with a [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon), which Pu [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet)ted. Sawada followed up with a Brimaz, while Pu had a Trouble for 6. Pu tried to mount some pressure with a [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix), but Sawada had a [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) for it. A [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) and [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood) took care of the Brimaz, but Sawada had a second to mount more pressure on Pu.
