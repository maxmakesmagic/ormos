New Phyrexia came to Prague this weekend, and a highly-talented top 8 showed that this is a Limited format that is going to test the skills of the best players in the world at Pro Tour Nagoya next month.


Headlining the final eight was former Player of the Year Shuhei Nakamura, but he fell in the semi final to old-school Czech player Ondrej Baudys, a multiple National title-holder, with a pedigree at the highest level dating back to 1996.


Emerging from the other bracket was Lukas Blohon, with a Black-White deck headlined by [Enslave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enslave) , [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) , and [Mimic Vat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimic+Vat) . Blohon took the opener, but the powerful Red-Black deck of Baudys made it a fight to the finish. In the decider, it was Baudys with his [Flesh-Eater Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh-Eater+Imp) who prevailed, poisoning in Prague for one devastating final time.


Fifteen years after his first high-level finish, the veteran had claimed a Grand Prix title.


Congratulations to Ondrej Baudys, Champion of Grand Prix Prague 2011!
