Are you ready for *Magic: The Gathering* to invade Boston? Not only will we be holding the biggest *Magic: The Gathering* event of all time, the Mythic Invitational, but we are also holding a *War of the Spark* panel. With ***sixteen*** exclusive card reveals, and the debut of the *War of the Spark* trailer—you better be ready.


When and how can I watch?
=========================


The Mythic Invitational will be broadcast live on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) beginning at 10 a.m. Thursday through Saturday, and 11:30 a.m. for the Top 4 on Sunday (Eastern US Time). We'll be bringing round-by-round coverage straight to your screen, so tune in all weekend to catch the action!

What is the format?
===================


The Mythic Invitational will feature double-elimination play through all days of the tournament, including Sunday, and feature a brand-new format we are calling Duo Standard.


In Duo Standard, players will submit two Standard-legal decks. Players will not sideboard between games, though they may submit a sideboard (for cards such as [Mastermind's Acquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastermind%27s+Acquisition)). Players can submit two different decks, two decks of the same archetype with different cards in both, or the exact same deck twice.


Match play will take place using both of each players' submitted decks. Matches will be conducted as follows:


* Game 1 – The deck each player uses and who goes first will be randomized.
* Game 2 – Players will use the deck unused in Game 1, and the player who went second in Game 1 will go first.
* Game 3 (if necessary) – Each player chooses which of their two decks to play and the player who goes first is determined at random.

Schedule (all times ET)
=======================


**Thursday, March 28**


* 10:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m.: Day One

**Friday, March 29**


* 10:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m.: Day Two

That *War of the Spark* panel sounds awesome! What's in it?
===========================================================
