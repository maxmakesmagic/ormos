Both these players have two more matches here at Great Britain Nationals 2011. One of them will advance to the final, with a guarantee of a place in the World Championship team for San Francisco, with a chance at the National title, while the loser here faces a 3rd/4th play-off for the final slot on the team. Still, at least a place on the plane to California is already secure.


### Game One


The curse of the mulligan struck early, with Pinder holding at six, but Sajgalik starting at just five. [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) was countered by Sajgalik's [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) also got countered, this time by [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), meaning [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) was the first card into play.


"So, let's see" said Sajgalik. "I basically mulliganed to eight..." as he cast [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), and reloaded.

*Tim Pinder* |



[Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) attacked for the first damage of the match, Sajgalik adding a second [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). Pinder added [Vampire Lacerator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator), but Sajgalik had [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) ready with kicker during the next attack.


[Blackcleave Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs) represented red mana for Pinder who had a lot of good cards left in hand. Sajgalik, meanwhile, wiped the board with [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment).


The second phase of the game began with Sajgalik at 12, Pinder quickly making that 9 with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), 7 with [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), and [Gatekeeper of Malakir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir) coming down. [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements) and [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) came down for Sajgalik, who was back up to 13, just when it seemed Pinder was closing in on the opening game. After a brutal attack, the board cleared, [Gatekeeper of Malakir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir) taking out Sajgalik's final Reinforcement Soldier. [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) put Sajgalik to 10, and [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) returned from the graveyard before joining [Gatekeeper of Malakir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir) in the red zone. Sajgalik was back down to 8.


Sajgalik had plans, however. [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) took out [Blackcleave Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs), and he banged down the white planeswalker [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura).


Although Pinder had [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) for an activated [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) he certainly didn't have any more pressure. The following turn, Sajgalik cast [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan), returning the Colonnade to play. Pinder had been in topdeck mode for several turns, while Sajgalik was sending the Colonnade turn after turn. [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) with kicker kept him comfortable, and the double mulligan had again been defeated.


Tim Pinder 0 - 1 Eduardo Sajgalik

### Game Two


Pinder opened with [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), seeing [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel), [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast) and Plains - oh, and a [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), which went away. [Kalastria Highborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) and [Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage) were down before Sajgalik had a play, his [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) on turn three. Although Sajgalik cast [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), Pinder had the mana left to make him pay, dropping Sajgalik to 10 via [Kalastria Highborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn).


[Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382187) got [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep), leaving two land and [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel) in hand for Sajgalik. Pinder used [Manic Vandal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) to kill Sajgalik's [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), who replied with his [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel). That got the attention of a Pinder [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and Pinder had Sajgalik down to 8, with [Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage) and [Manic Vandal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) opposite one lonely token from the [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel).


Sajgalik found [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), fetching up the other two. Two Hawks traded for [Manic Vandal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal), but Sajgalik was still down to six, and a freshly-played [Kalastria Highborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) was going to be an issue.The third [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) saw Sajgalik respond with [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) with kicker, sending [Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage) back to hand. Then the [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition) resolved, stealing the last [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), leaving Sajgalik with just [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse).


Sajgalik fell to just one life, and really needed some [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements). Moments later, he had them. From the top. Three Soldiers, back up to seven life. Next turn, he topdecked [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), activated his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), and dealt four poison damage, untapping his lands...


An amazing comeback, with [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel) completing the deal, and leaving Pinder in a 0-2 hole.


Tim Pinder 0 - 2 Eduardo Sajgalik


### Game Three


Pinder mulliganed to five, and his turn one [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) showed only [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) and [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) apart from lands.


Turn two [Kalastria Highborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) was decent, as was turn three [Kalastria Highborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn). They were presumably only going to live, however, until Sajgalik laid land number four and cast [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). In came the Highborns, Sajgalik fell to 14, cast [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), and Pinder had the mana to punish Sajgalik all the way down to 8. Pinder tried to reload with [Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage).


Sajgalik had [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements) right when he needed them. Now he was back up to 14. He added [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel) and started making tokens.


[Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) lasted almost no time before meeting [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), but even at 12 life Sajgalik was in total control. He activated [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade), piled in for eight damage, with Pinder now close to elimination. [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) ensured Pinder would have no red mana, although [Blackcleave Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs) would eventually change that. If, that was, eventually would get to come around.

*Who makes the final?* |



Sajgalik activated [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and dropped Pinder to just five, with six flying damage available for the following turn. [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) killed the Colonnade, but Pinder was still at three life. Could he escape, with Sajgalik at 12? [Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage), [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), and [Kalastria Highborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) were in play. [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and [Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage) were in hand.


The [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) attacked alone, puting Sajgalik to 10. Another [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) attacked with one Bird token, causing Pinder to respond by sacrificing both [Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage)s. Pinder was at 2, Sajgalik at 6.


One last attack from Pinder, and we were done. This had been almost as one-sided as the quarter final, with Sajgalik seemingly finding exactly what he needed every time he needed it.


**Tim Pinder 0 - 3 Eduardo Sajgalik**
