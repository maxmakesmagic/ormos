I sat down with some familiar faces to ask, "What's the most interesting play you've seen this weekend?

***Tom Martell:** "I had [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and two copies of [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) in my hand. My opponent was at three. I had exactly enough lands to cast [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), but I was dead the next turn. I cast [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and returned [Volcanic Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Island) to my hand to counter my own [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) with [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) unless I paid one. Then I returned another land to my hand and used my second copy of [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) to target the first. [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) resolved, I found [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and I was able to replay the [Volcanic Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Island) to kill my opponent."*

***Joshua Cho:** "I floated mana and sacrificed lands to cast [Fireblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast). This left me with enough cards in graveyard and mana in pool to cast [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), draw into another land and spell, and get my opponent for lethal damage with [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear)."*
