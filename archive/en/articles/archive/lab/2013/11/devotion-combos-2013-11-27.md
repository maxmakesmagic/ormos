Welcome to the Lab, folks! We're kicking off Devotion Week here on DailyMTG, and I have a pair of decks built around the mechanic for your viewing pleasure. With devotion having only been in one set so far, there aren't a huge number of cards to choose from, and there are a few ideas I'll be saving for later. ([Celestial Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Dawn), I'm watching you.) However, there are some powerful tools available already. 

BBB Gun
 Black in particular got a sweet deal with [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), and to a lesser extent [Abhorrent Overlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord). Blue might have the most powerful devotion card in [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves), but having two strong finishers makes the deck more consistent. Additionally, black has access to better devotion enablers than any other color by far.
