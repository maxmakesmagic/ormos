Matteo Cirigliano vs. Manuel Bucher
-----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm10_1.jpg)Matteo is the only undefeated player in the tournament and his Shard-powered deck has been the talk of the tournament. Accross the table is one more challenge. Bucher is defending his country from this Italian who appears keen on sweeping the Swiss portion of the tournament.


### Game 1


Cirigliano had to send his first hand back. They played "land go" for quite a while, until Manuel played a turn five [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone). Matteo used [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) to draw extra cards and passed the turn back.


When the Swiss tried [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), the Italian showed him [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend). He got his Thirst back with [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). The Swiss thought that was a good idea and played his own Witness to get Thoren back.


[Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) came out to blow the Stone but Bucher blew it himself to see some cards with [Tel-Jilad Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Justice). [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) gave him his second [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).


Matteo sent his crew in and the Witness traded. They both played [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum)s and went back to staring at each other accross the table. Bucher resolved [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), after Matteo stared at his hand for a few seconds.


The [Crystal Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Shard) in his hand wasn't as useful with the Stone on the table. He attacked and traded his Shaman for the Thoren. Another Scrying gave Bucher his third [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).


The [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) came to life and blocked the Italian Thoren. Bucher attacked with it and tried [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). A huge [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) stopped it. With his opponent now tapped out the young Swiss unleashed a entwined [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). Out came two [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) returning the [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone).


Matteo scooped.


Manuel 1-0 Matteo.


### Game 2


The Swiss tried a second turn [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) but [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) put an end to that. Or tried to, because on the next turn [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) brought the spell back. Matteo played Troll Astetic and tried to speed things along. He knew in the long game he would have trouble controlling Bucher's massive spells.


Next he tried [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) stopped that. Hiding behind his Troll Cirigliano used [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) to get his [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) back. Bucher baited it out with [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) and the Italian was happy to oblige.


A [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) resolved and traded with the Witness. By now the Troll Astetic had Bucher at six. He tried a [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) and when Matteo Cirigliano showed him [Last Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Word) he made the following comment:


Manuel: "I'll go first."


Manuel 1-1 Matteo.


### Game 3


Again the Swiss played turn three [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) and again the Italian answered with [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) stopped [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) and Bucher was stuck on four lands.


Matteo risked Troll Astetic and the Swiss found his fifth land. He blew up the Stone but Cirigliano had [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) to save his amazing creature. The Troll came back, and Manuel played another [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone).


Again, Bucher's mana fail him. He was still at five. He blew the Stone and tried [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). [Last Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Word) put an end to that plan.


The Troll Astetic kept on pounding, while Matteo battled to keep any blocker out of the way. Manuel tried [Duplicant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) next and again Matteo had an answer: [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm10_2.jpg)he was four turns away from riding the Troll all the way. Bucher found another land and tried [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion). Matteo had [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul). The Swiss went to five. He tried [Plated Slagwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Slagwurm), and the Italian had ANOTHER [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend).


The Troll marched in, Manuel fell to two. Manuel Bucher had one last chance: he tried an entwined [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). Obviously Matteo had [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend). Obviously.


Final result:


Matteo 2-1 Manuel. Matteo Cirigliano is one match win away from the Perfect Swiss.
