So you've been wondering what's going on with this new/old set, *Coldsnap*. First you hear that [it's a long-lost set from the Wizards vaults](/en/node/632201)—[then we set you straight](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/back-issues-2006-02-06) that it's actually a new set designed to cohere with a never-completed *Ice Age* block. Now it's time to strap on the fur gloves—and that one hat you got from your always-freezing aunt, the one with the earflaps on it—because now it's time to face that wintry blast for yourself.

For today, the [*Coldsnap* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/coldsnap/home) goes live.

Here's what you'll find, now and later:

* NOW: The entire scanned contents of the *Ice Age* comic from 1996, part 1 of 2
