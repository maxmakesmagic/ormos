Exploring Ixalan by Exploring Our World—Again

Prior to *Ixalan*, we set up a fun, [globe-spanning geocaching activity](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/exploring-ixalan-exploring-our-world-2017-08-14) that gave people an excuse to go outside and experience a bit of [travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZk1WHJ_fwo). It was a blast.


Meanwhile, back on Ixalan, our four tribes were experiencing a less fulfilling type of travel as they fought it out to be the first to find the golden city of Orazca. Rumor (and also *Magic* Story) has it they're still searching for that city.


So, to keep playing along with the story, we're putting a tribal twist on the geocaching activity with *Rivals of Ixalan* and throwing in ten preview cards to go with it.


Here's how it's going to work. We'll be distributing 4,000 trackable items: 1,000 each for Dinosaurs, Merfolk, Vampires, and Pirates. We'll be tracking the mileage of all the trackables *and* each individual tribe.



![Thaumatic Compass](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/cardart_XLN_Thaumatic-Compass.jpg)[Thaumatic Compass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thaumatic+Compass) | Art by [Yeong-Hao Han](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Yeong-Hao+Han%22%5d)
You can sign up [here](https://www.geocaching.com/promotions/promo/magic/) for your chance to receive a trackable. Signups will run from November 28 (that's tomorrow!) till December 1 (that's Friday!) and the trackables will be sent out on December 4.


After receiving a game piece, participants will activate and log the game pieces on [Geocaching.com](https://www.geocaching.com/play), take photos, and place them into a geocache container to start them on their explorative journey. Geocache containers stay in one place for the duration of their life cycle, while the trackable game pieces move from container to container. You'll probably want to download the Geocaching.com app to participate. Because we live in the future.


To follow along at home or to share cool things you find (like, say, trackables?), keep an eye on the #MTGGeocachers hashtag on both Instagram and Twitter. You know, where the cool internet kids hang out.


The Fate of Orazca
==================


Wait a minute, why are we tracking the tribal trackables individually?


Excellent question, hypothetical voice I set up for this article. I think I can answer that.


We're going to try something a little new with *Rivals of Ixalan* by letting you—yes, you!—decide who controls the golden city at the end of the *Rivals of Ixalan* story.


Will it be overrun by the Dinosaurs? Controlled by Merfolk? Infested by Vampires? Or become a haven for Pirates?


You don't have to participate in the geocaching activity to have a voice in who holds the city. Starting in January, different regions around the world will hold votes on social media or the *Magic* website that will help determine who takes it all. Based on the outcome of these votes (and getting the most trackable miles), we'll award points to each faction. We'll tally those up, and the faction with the most points will be declared the victor and will possess the golden city.


So watch the various social media accounts in your region (Twitter or Facebook, primarily) for these votes, and help choose the fate of Ixalan!
