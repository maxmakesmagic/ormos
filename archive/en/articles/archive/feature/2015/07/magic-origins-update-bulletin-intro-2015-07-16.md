Magic Origins Update Bulletin—Intro
===================================

Matt Tabak is the reigning, defending, and undisputed rules manager for Magic: The Gathering, Kaijudo, and Duel Masters. Matt Tabak is Gruul. Matt Tabak tries to laugh, think, and cry every day. Matt Tabak is hungry. Matt Tabak doesn't want you to sass him. Matt Tabak loves puppies.
 






*Magic*. *Magic* is what brings us together today. *Magic*, that blessed event. That dream within a dream. Love. True love. Wait, what? Skip to the update? Just one more minute.



We've billed *Magic Origins* as the last core set, but it's really quite a bit more. New abilities, the return of a few abilities promoted to "evergreen" status, and a whole lot of sweet new cards. I hate to rely on marketing-friendly sentences like "It's a great time to be a *Magic* player," but it's so obviously true. Back when I started, my involvement with the game when not playing the game was pretty much just me sketching out decklists while pretending to pay attention in college classes. Now, with event coverage everywhere, more articles written about the game than one person could reasonably keep up with, and social media, you can pack more *Magic* into your life than ever before.



But it all starts with the cards—and for me, with the rules that make those cards work. And each set brings some changes to both. So, let's break those changes down for you. If you run into a card or rule that you feel should be tweaked, let us know about it. Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tabakrules), [tumblr](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/), OKCupid, MySpace, or Farmers Only. I'm pretty sure if any of those accounts actually exist, they're linked somewhere on this page.
