*Time Spiral* overflows with allusions. Check the cards you got at the prerelease, or browse the spoiler—you’ll find resurrected mechanics, Easter egg art references, tips-o’-the-hat in both card names and flavor text, even combinations of nods to multiple past **Magic** cards that span all parts of the card. It would take a keen eye and accomplished **Magic** career for you to identify them all, but we’ll give you hints for a few—well, no, for a metric ton—of them here over the next few months. Keep an eye or two on **magicthegathering.com** for the continuously-unfolding allusion-fest.


Here’s a sample.


*Time Spiral’s* Dread Return is [Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) tricked out with a nice flashback option, but it also pays homage to a certain critter you may want to combine with it.

Check out what’s doing the dreadful returning in the art. Need a hint? It’s a creature from another black card illustrated by Kev Walker. Look closely:

![Mindslicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mindslicer)


It’s an undead [Mindslicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslicer)! You might want to [Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) your already-sac’ed [Mindslicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslicer)s, or sacrifice one to trigger its vicious ability again… Mmm, artistic combo!
