Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:). This week we take an look at the creation of *Darksteel's* 
**[Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch)** by Carl Critchlow. 


### 1. Art Description


Here were the instructions given to Mr. Critchlow for the project:



> 
> *"Money shot of Memnarch (p. 13 of style guide). Remember that he's an artifact creature who's slowly developing flesh. Line between metal and flesh should be very blurry."*

The task of illustrating an iconic character of a **Magic** setting presents a special challenge to an artist. Memnarch was sketched out in the *Mirrodin* Style Guide already: his look has already been defined. So the artist must put a creative spin on this vision while maintaining the prescribed look -- or, putting it another way, he must illustrate the preexisting character while still expressing his own artistry. It's a tricky balance.


Critchlow has been steadily illustrating **Magic** cards since the time of *Weatherlight* (in which he has illustrated the legends [Morinfen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morinfen) and [Gallowbraid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallowbraid)). Recently he has been seen on *Mirrodin's* entire [Replica cycle](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-playtest-cards-ii-2003-11-03) and, in *Darksteel*, a couple of [Arcbound Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Arcbound%2BOverseer)
[Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Arcbound%2BRavager) and the splashy [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus).


### 2. Sketches


Mr. Critchlow came up with this initial sketch for [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch). 



It's interesting to note that many **Magic** artists turn over full-color sketches. Memnarch's blue influence is definitely seen in the rough sketch above. For the final art, Critchlow's attention to detail went into overdrive, and the rough edges became clean, gleaming lines.


### 3. Final Art


Here is the final piece as it was turned over to the **Magic** art team:



That is the raw scan of Carl's finished piece. But there is another step to go in the process before it's ready to go on the card. 


### 3b. Color Correction


The production team has to color-correct the scan to make sure it is bright enough, rich enough, and balanced enough in its color contrast to look good on a **Magic** card. Below you can see the results of the color-correcting process.


Here is the *final* final art for [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch). 



### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
