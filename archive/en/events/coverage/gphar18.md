Day 2 Coverage



Matt Nass made good. Just a few weeks after advancing to the Top 8 of Grand Prix Phoenix with the newly resurgent Krark-Clan Ironworks brew that he described as the best deck in Modern, Nass ran it back at Grand Prix Hartford, to even better results.


1,800 players competed in a sold-out event, packing the hall in Connecticut to slug it out in *Magic’s* most diverse format. It most certainly lived up to that reputation, with 65 unique archetypes making Day 2 and 15 different decks in the Top 16.


Bogles was the only repeat deck in that group, but it was Nass and Ironworks against Michael Mapson and Amulet Titan in the finals. The pair played a thrilling three-game set, with even the mighty Ruric Thar, the Unbowed making an appearance in the deciding game. But even Ruric Thar couldn’t stand up to the power of Scrap Trawler, and Nass was able to eventually power through the legend to combo off and crown himself the champion of Grand Prix Hartford.
