Most of the legends in *Time Spiral* are front-and-center, nestled cozily inside the borders of their own card.



But some make their presence known more obliquely. [Jedit Ojanen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit+Ojanen), a fierce legendary cat warrior from the *Legends* set, is referenced only through [Jedit's Dragoons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit%27s+Dragoons).

In a controversial move, Jedit left his tribe of fellow cat warriors to join the Robaran [Mercenaries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mercenaries), and later battles the evil lord [Johan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Johan) (see the [comic book](/en/articles/archive/jedit-ojanen-comic-ii-2005-04-06) for more). The tribe he left behind may have learned a lesson in survival, because [Jedit's Dragoons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit%27s+Dragoons) are still kicking around Dominaria.


Like Jedit, [Jacques le Vert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jacques+le+Vert) isn't timeshifted into the set himself, but he shows up on [Pendelhaven Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven+Elder)'s flavor text. Jacques, [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) and [Pendelhaven Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven+Elder) all share the theme of protecting fellow forest-dwellers.
