By Wizards of the Coast











![Slayer of the Wicked](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked)**[Slayer of the Wicked](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked)** – *Innistrad* uncommon. The art for [Slayer of the Wicked](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slayer+of+the+Wicked) shows two creatures, but they're not the slayer and a victim. Actually, according to the art description, it's a father-and-son team who work together as monster hunters!
 ![1623](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1623)**[Kismet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1623)** – *Legends* uncommon. Many years ago, [Kismet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kismet) combined with [Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis) to lock down decks pretty well. But it only tapped creatures, lands, and artifacts! In *Betrayers of Kamigawa*, [Orb of Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orb+of+Dreams) finished the job, affecting enchantments and, now, planeswalkers. Just in case!
 ![Dream Coat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dream+Coat)**[Dream Coat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Coat)** – *Legends* uncommon. Anthony Waters is credited as the artist on [thirteen cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Anthony%20Waters%22%5D), ranging from *Legends* up to *Alliances*. After that, his credit switched to [Anthony S. Waters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Anthony%20S.%20Waters%22%5D) for another 109 cards. This is vital information if someone plays one of *Unhinged*'s ["artist-matters" cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?text=+%5Bartist%5D) against you.
 ![986](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=986)**[Desert](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=986)** – *Arabian Nights* common. Well, what else would come after the appetizer and the dinner?
 ![Hunting Grounds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hunting+Grounds)**[Hunting Grounds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Grounds)** – *Judgment* rare. Yesterday's card, [Demonic Appetite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Appetite) was picked to reference the "appetizer." Today's card mentions "dinner" (well, a "dinner bell") in its flavor text. There's only one more card of the day left before the site breaks for Thanksgiving!
 ![Demonic Appetite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Demonic+Appetite)**[Demonic Appetite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Appetite)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* common. [Demonic Appetite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Appetite) calls all the way back to the *Alpha* card [Lord of the Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=70). Although not all of **Magic**'s demons like sacrificing creatures, it's still pops up occasionally as iconic demonic behavior.
 ![Necropolis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Necropolis)**[Necropolis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropolis)** – *The Dark* uncommon. The original [Necropolis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropolis) (as opposed to the [Keldon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon) or [Crumbling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling) kind) dares players to find a way to make use of it. You could probably start with [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) and some variation of [Animate Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Wall) if you had to.
 ![Empty the Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Empty+the+Catacombs)**[Empty the Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Catacombs)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* rare. A catacomb can be either an underground cemetery or just any underground maze of twisty passages. Most of [**Magic**'s catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bcatacomb%5D) are of the "maze" variety, but the kind that [Empty the Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Catacombs) is emptying is unambiguously the kind filled with dead bodies.
 ![Boneyard Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Boneyard+Wurm)**[Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm)** – *Innistrad* uncommon. The ability that defines [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm)'s power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield. If [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm) is in your graveyard, it will count itself.
 ![Cemetery Puca](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cemetery+Puca)**[Cemetery Puca](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Puca)** – *Shadowmoor* rare. A puca (which can be spelled a lot of different ways) is a mischievous creature from Celtic folklore. It's got the head of a horse, so it shouldn't be confused with the donkey-headed [Noggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?type=+%5Bnoggle%5D%7C%7Csubtype=+%5Bnoggle%5D). Or the donkey-headed [Donkeyfolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?type=+%5Bdonkey%5D%7C%7Csubtype=+%5Bdonkey%5D).
 ![988](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=988)**[Elephant Graveyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=988)** – *Arabian Nights* rare. The "elephant graveyard" is a mythical place where all elephants go to die. There's one in Disney's *The Lion King*. And here's something else interesting: There is precisely [one Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=982) in *Arabian Nights*.
 ![Shrewd Hatchling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shrewd+Hatchling)**[Shrewd Hatchling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrewd+Hatchling)** – *Eventide* uncommon. *Eventide*'s [Hatchling cycle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Bhatchling%5D&set=%7C%5B%22eventide%22%5D) was originally slated for *Shadowmoor*, but got axed because that set had too many cycles in it. Mark Rosewater kept it around for the next set, because the manipulation of -1/-1 counters felt like a natural evolution of *Shadowmoor*'s mechanics.
 ![Midsummer Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Midsummer+Revel)**[Midsummer Revel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midsummer+Revel)** – *Urza's Saga* rare. The "growing enchantments" of *Urza's Saga* were inspired by the similarly-growing [Legacy's Allure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy%27s+Allure) from *Tempest*. All of the *Urza's Saga* versions were based on songs, which is why they all used [verse counters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?text=+%5Bverse%5D+%5Bcounter%5D).
 ![Hamlet Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hamlet+Captain)**[Hamlet Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hamlet+Captain)** – *Innistrad* uncommon. A hamlet is a small village. And it makes perfect sense that in a place like Innistrad, with all its werewolves and geists and vampires and so on, a hamlet would want someone to be in charge of the first line of defense!
 ![Measure of Wickedness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Measure+of+Wickedness)**[Measure of Wickedness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Measure+of+Wickedness)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* uncommon. Once, there was a powerful combo consisting of [Donate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Donate) and [Illusions of Grandeur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusions+of+Grandeur) (and possibly [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence), because why not, right?). [Measure of Wickedness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Measure+of+Wickedness) combined the donating and the life loss and put it in one card!
 ![Tempest Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tempest+Efreet)**[Tempest Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempest+Efreet)** – *Fourth Edition* rare. Although it's classed with the "ante cards" for purposes of being banned in every format, [Tempest Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempest+Efreet) actually bypasses the ante system for an even more direct method of changing card ownership.
 ![Fat Ass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fat+Ass)**[Fat Ass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fat+Ass)** – *Unhinged* rare. During playtesting, this card gave rise to a very important R&D discussion (which could easily be confused for an argument in any other context). The question: [Is Gum Food?](http://www.wizards.com/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/mr147_gum.jpg)
![Clifftop Retreat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Clifftop+Retreat)**[Clifftop Retreat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clifftop+Retreat)** – *Innistrad* rare. The "retreat" in the name of [Clifftop Retreat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clifftop+Retreat) is meant in the sense of "a place of refuge, seclusion, or privacy" rather than "the act of withdrawing." See those buildings on top of the cliffs? They have monks in them!
 ![Trapfinder's Trick](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Trapfinder%27s+Trick)**[Trapfinder's Trick](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trapfinder%27s+Trick)** – *Zendikar* common. [Trapfinder's Trick](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trapfinder%27s+Trick) and [Trapmaker's Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trapmaker%27s+Snare) are the reasons that the "Trap" subtype was allowed to exist in *Zendikar*. You can't have a subtype and then not do something with it! For a more recent example, see [Bitterheart Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterheart+Witch) and [Witchbane Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witchbane+Orb).
 ![Mask of Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mask+of+Avacyn)**[Mask of Avacyn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Avacyn)** – *Innistrad* uncommon. [Mask of Avacyn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Avacyn) isn't something you'd wear if you wanted to look like Avacyn. It's something you'd wear if you *were* Avacyn and wanted to keep your face safe while you flew into battle.
