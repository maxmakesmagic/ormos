Andy Wolf was once thought of as an old-timer, but his original return to the game came with a Pro Tour Top 8 at Los Angeles. Now he's 6-0 and on a run for a Top 8 here. In his way is Matt Linde, powerful ex-member of the defunct Huey, Brock and Linde and good friend of the man who might be America's best player, William Jensen. He's playing Brian Kibler's Black-White control, and is looking for an easy matchup against Wolf's red-green.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpatl03/a938.jpg)Linde won the roll and opened with a strong set of Grappler, [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), while Linde just cycled an [Eternal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon). Linde dropped a morph on his third turn, but it Wolf had the [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer) to force through more damage.

Linde untapped and threw [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) on the table. Wolf swept his men off the board in silence. He had a heck of a rejoinder at the ready: [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat). A nearby Chris Pikula had to turn away and giggle like a schoolgirl. Linde dropped [Temple of the False God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+the+False+God) and a face-up Angel, ending his turn quickly.

Wolf played a [Goblin Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief) and sat back. Linde rushed into the Red Zone to get back up to eight life. Wolf tried making another Warchief and swinging in, but a cycled [Decree of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) put two soldiers in front of each. That seemed the death knell as the Angel pulled Linde farther and farther out of reach. There was brief hope when [Goblin Grappler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Grappler) inherited [Elephant Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide), if Wolf had a burn spell he could kill the Angel. He did not, and scooped.

"Stupid Angel. Stupid [Temple of the False God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+the+False+God)." – Andy Wolf

Linde 1 – Wolf 0

### Game 2

Wolf brought in a pair of [Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call)ers of the Claw and three [Call of the Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd), subbing out a [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander), a [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), [Hammer of Bogardan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer+of+Bogardan), a [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder) and one other card. Linde brought in two [Wipe Clean](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Clean), two [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise) and two [Sphere of Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Law) for [Decree of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice), [Haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes), [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and three [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying).

"There's another round after this one? So even if Andy wins we still can't eat? Then win, I guess." – Chris Pikula

Wolf's start was short of spectacular in Game 2, thanks in part to a mulligan, with just a pair of Grapplers serving on the third turn. He still didn't have a forest on his third turn and couldn't cast his hand of green goodies. He made no play on his fourth turn either. Linde [Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath)ed away his 1/1's.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpatl03/a940.jpg)Wolf ripped a [Wooded Foothills](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills) and got a [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) on board. Linde went one better and showed him Temple and Angel. Wolf suited up his [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) with a Guide and swung in. Linde took it and fired back. Wolf kept up the pressure with a [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat), but Linde had [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) to cut down the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). He fell to seven, then rose to eleven after cycling a [Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeance). Another [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) got rid of the token. After that came a cycled Decree and then another Angel.

"I think what I need here is an Anarchy." – Andy Wolf

However, rather than cheat and pull one from a nearby binder, he scooped up his cards.

**Final Result:** Matt Linde defeats Chris Pikula 2-0
