Peter Vieren had made the Top 8 of a Grand Prix before, five years ago in Lyon. For Davor Detecnik this was his first foray into the territory. Both had already overcome heavy opposition in the quarterfinals: Vieren beat Grand Prix Portland 2013's quarterfinalist Mattia Rizzi, while Detecnik eliminated last year's Grand Prix Utrecht champion Oliver Polak-Rottmann. Now they faced each other, for a chance to advance to the finals.


Detecnik had followed common wisdom and was running the most popular deck at this Grand Prix: Hangarback Abzan. His opponent came equipped with Blue-Black Control, a much more uncommon choice.


The Games
=========


In the first game, Detecnik led with [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). The former died to [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), the latter was taken out by [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault). Eventually. First [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault) just sat on the table, a looming engine of doom stopping Detecnik from deploying any more threats.

When Detecnik finally forced Vieren to use the nuclear option, the latter had already drawn some extra cards with [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity), had amassed enough lands, and had a full hand that meant he was unlikely to lose control over the siuation anytime soon.


And so it was. The game didn't really end here, but it may as well have. After a lot of trades, after several copies of [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), Detecnik was out of threats, left with no cards in hand and no nonlands on the battlefield, facing [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death). Only then did he finally concede.


**Peter Vieren 1-0 Davor Detecnik**


The second game didn't go much better for Detecnik. A couple of early creatures met spot removal spells, his first multiple-creature offense was wiped out by [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish), and Vieren was able to cast [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess).


Things aren't always what they seem, however, and Detecnik succesfully reentered the race with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost). Suddenly, Vieren found himself in need of chump-blocking with [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy)!

No need to worry, though. There's almost no pickle that a timely combination of [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) plus [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) can't undo. Detecnik lost his creatures, and most of his hope. When he summoned his next creature, he was already staring at one [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) and one [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) on Vieren's side. Then Vieren added insult to injury in the form of [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) and Detecnik extended his hand.


**Peter Vieren 2-0 Davor Detecnik**
