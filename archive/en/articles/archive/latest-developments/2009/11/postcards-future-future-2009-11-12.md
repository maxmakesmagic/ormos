Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now.

*August 5, 2008*

I've been at Wizards for two weeks now. It's still every bit as cool as I thought it was going to be, and I'm learning more every day about what goes into making **Magic**.

From what I've seen, the majority of the Constructed testing we do is Standard, current with the most recent set that is in development. For example, right now *Conflux* (which was announced just last week) is the most recent set under active development, so we're playing with all of *Tenth Edition*, *Lorwyn Block*, *Shards of Alara*, and *Conflux*, which is what Standard will look like in the real world when *Conflux* releases. We call this format the Future Future League.

Because the cards we are playing with haven't been printed yet, we have to find other ways to play with them. The method most people use is to use "blanks," or **Magic** cards with blank white fronts, combined with the dizzying array of sharpies in the office.

I'm still learning the cards, so this is a little tricky for me. Most people are in a bit of a hurry when they build their FFL decks, and they don't use much detail when they write their cards down. For example, this is what most [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s would look like.
