In recent months, Miracles has become the de facto deck to beat of Legacy. Why is that so? What makes this deck tick, what are its crucial elements and strengths, and why has it risen to the number one spot only now, even though the concept's been around for a number of years already?


We asked a couple of pro players in attendance this weekend for their insight ...

*Joel Larsson*


**Pro Tour *Magic Origins* champion Joel Larsson:** The format has changed because it's being played so much on Magic Online. In a way, it has become more streamlined as a result, which is a huge boon for [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)/[Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). Also, I have this theory that the number of viable decks has gone down with the influx of Eldrazi. In turn, Miracles has really been able to shine, now that one needs to deal with a smaller variety of threats. Miracles is clearly the best deck at the moment.

*Immanuel Gerschenson*


**Two-time Grand Prix champion Immanuel Gerschenson:** Miracles has game against everything and can easily be adjusted to beat almost anything. Although I'm not sure whether that includes Eldrazi. And the combo of [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) is amazing, easily the biggest source of virtual card advantage in the game. It's effectively like drawing an insane amount of extra cards.

*Magnus Lantto*


**2014 *Magic Online* Champion Magnus Lantto:** Miracles simply is the best deck, has answers to everything and very powerful cards of its own. But it's also very hard to play and super slow. It could never be, like, half the field, because the mirror match takes forever and often ends in a draw.

*Alexander Hayne*


**Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* champion Alexander Hayne:** Miracles is the best deck in the format. It has a very fluid mana and spell base, has all of the best card selection of the format, and the combo of [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), like [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void), locks a lot of decks out of the game. Basically, it allows you to run the best spells, the blue ones, inside your control deck.
