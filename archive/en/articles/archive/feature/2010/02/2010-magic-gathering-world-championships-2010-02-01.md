### Travel Information



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/makuhari_messe.jpg)This year's **Magic: The Gathering** World Championships will be held in the Makuhari Messe convention center, located in the Kaihin Makuhari area of Chiba, Japan. Since it opened in October 1989, Makuhari Messe has been Japan's premier convention center, regularly hosting the Tokyo Motor Show, the Tokyo Game Show, the Jump Festa (a manga, anime, and video game exposition), and other high-profile conventions and concerts. 


**Getting There**
  
 Travelers arriving from outside Japan at Narita Airport can travel to the Makuhari Messe area using either an express bus or by taking advantage of Japan's sophisticated rail system.


The easiest and most direct route is via Keisei Limousine Bus. Counters for the bus can be found in the arrival area in both terminals of the airport. A one-way fare to the Makuhari area costs ¥1,200, and the trip takes approximately 45 minutes (subject to traffic conditions). A return ticket to the airport can be purchased at the bell captain desk of most hotels in the Makuhari area. Busses to and from the airport depart once per hour; be sure to check the departure schedule when arranging your return trip.


There is no direct train service between Narita Airport and the Makuhari Messe area. Here are the two most direct routes: 


 1) Board the Keisei Narita Sky Express at the airport underground station. Travel six stops to Higashi-matsudo station (東松戸) and transfer to the JR Musashino line (ＪＲ武蔵野線). Kaihin Makuhari station (海浜幕張), the closest station to Makuhari Messe, is six stops from Higashi-matsudo. Total fare for this trip is ¥1,200. 


2) Board the JR Narita Express at the airport underground station. Travel to Tokyo station and transfer to the JR Keiyo line (ＪＲ京葉線). The Keiyo line runs both regular and express trains to Kaihin Makuhari; actual travel time will depend on which train is taken. Total fare for this trip is ¥3,280.


Travelers coming from the Tokyo area, including those arriving at Haneda Airport, should take the JR Keiyo line from Tokyo station. The fare from Tokyo is ¥540.
