You first saw [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) as Mark Rosewater’s [example](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/utter-chaos-2007-01-15) of the vanishing mechanic during *Planar Chaos* previews. Its similarity to a single-celled eukaryote is significant—if left unchecked, its growth potential is exponential. But what does exponential growth mean, really? If you had plenty of turns for [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) to do its thing, what would it look like?
