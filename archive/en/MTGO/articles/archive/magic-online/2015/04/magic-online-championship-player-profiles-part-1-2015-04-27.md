The *Magic Online* Championship is almost upon us. From Friday, May 15, to Sunday, May 17, a group of the best players on *Magic Online* will come together to compete for a share of more than $100,000 in cash prizes and, ultimately, the prestigious title of *Magic Online* Champion.


What led these players to the Championship? How long have they been playing *Magic*? If they had a theme song that played every time they entered a room, what would it be? To answer these questions, and more, we've interviewed the full line-up of *Magic Online* Championship participants.


Today’s group of profiles includes a Pro Tour Champion: [Antonio Del Moral Leon](#DelMoralLeon). He already has some pretty impressive trophies on his mantle, but a *Magic Online* Championship would certainly be a welcome addition for the Platinum Pro.


These player profiles will be spread out over the next three weeks, so check back every Monday to learn more about this year's *Magic Online* Championship competitors. Once you've read up on the participants, tune into [Twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) beginning May 15 for a live broadcast of the *Magic Online* Championship!


Click player names below to go directly to their profile, and remember to check back next week for more interviews. Follow the 2014 *Magic Online* Championship conversation on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) with the hashtag, [#MTGOChamp](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MTGOChamp&src=typd)!

Lukas Dusek
===========


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


I started to play *Magic* with *Return to Ravnica*, so December 2012 I think.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


My favorite format is Limited because I enjoy opening a random pool and thinking about all of the possibilities. I love the element of randomization it adds to *Magic*.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


I love water and my biggest hobbie is diving and swiming. Aside from that, I enjoy snowboarding, playing tabletop or computer games, and walking with my girlfriend around the river.


**How long have you been playing *Magic*?**


I have been playing *Magic* for two years and *Magic Online* for one year.


**What is your favorite *Magic* Card and why?**


I play Standard UB Control, so my favorite card is [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=386518)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386518)


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


Green, red, and yellow for a non-*Magic* color.


**What are you doing to prepare for the *Magic Online* Championship?**


I play every day for eight hours or so on *Magic Online*.


**Who is your favorite *Magic* player to watch?**


I've only played for two years, so I don't have a favorite player to watch yet.


**If you had a theme song that played every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


"We Are The Champions," by Queen.

I think I'll have a chance at top 4.

I am happy.

My best *Magic* result is Grand Prix Warszava 2014. The format was *Theros* Block Constructed and I got 26th place out of 1,199 entrants.


**How many hours a week do you think you spend on *Magic Online*?**


About sixty hours.


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**


It would be my best place in *Magic* and I would be very happy. The prize would go towards my debts and to prepare for future *Magic* events.

Sebastian Pozzo
===============


**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


When I was nine or ten years old my cousin appeared to me with an *Ice Age* deck and a *Fourth Edition* deck. The first boosters I bought were *Urza’s Saga* and the prize for the first tournament I played was *Core Set Seventh Edition* packs.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


Team sealed. I think having little tournaments makes it more special, plus, playing on a team with friends is great. Aside from that, I think it makes luck less of a factor.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


Swimming. And I also enjoy playing Settlers of Catan with my *Magic* teammates.


**How long have you been on *Magic Online*?**


Since 2008 I think. After I made the Top 8 at Grand Prix Buenos Aires I started to play a lot.


**What is your favorite *Magic* Card and why?**


I guess I would say [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). My first good results were playing Gifts Rock and usually searching [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish), [Genesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis), and something else.

**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


I really don’t hate much anything. I guess playing against aggro decks where you don’t have to make many choices is kind of frustrating.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


I don’t think some could represent me more than others. I just play what I think will give me better results, depending on the tournament. If I had to pick, I think blue and green.


**What are you doing to prepare for the *Magic Online* Championship?**


For the Standard portion, practicing with my team, *Magic* Lair, for Limited, drafting on *Magic Online*, and for Modern and Vintage, playing online and with Antonio Del Moral León.


**Who is your favorite *Magic* player to watch?**


Well, my friends of course!


**If you had a theme song that played every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


Without thinking more than a minute I would say “Everything In Its Right Place,” by Radiohead. Though, I think if that really happened I would stop loving it and get kind of sick of it, haha.


**What record do you think you’ll have at the end of the event?**


I really don’t have much of an idea because I haven't started testing yet. I am optimistic enough to think I will Top 4.


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**


I haven’t found any food I don’t like and I only weigh about 140 pounds to my almost six feet.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**


One Grand Prix Top 8. 27 lifetime Pro Points.


**How many hours a week do you think you spend on *Magic Online*?**


It varies. From five to thirty I would say.


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**


Becoming professional for over a year: the dream.

**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


Sealed because we can use over 75 cards. With such a big sideboard, it's very exciting!

Reading. There are too many books in the world. I like to play other games too.
