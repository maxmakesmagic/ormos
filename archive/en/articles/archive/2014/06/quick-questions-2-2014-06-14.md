**What is the best deck in Standard?**

*Marijn Lybaert: There isn't one. I would say that Boros Burn, Black Devotion variants, control like Esper or Blue White and Jund Monsters are the four top decks, and they are pretty evenly matched.*

*Alessandro Portaro: The [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) decks! They have all the answers, and when the game goes long it's impossible to lose.*

*Tomoharu Saito: That's a hard one. I like Blue/White, either with or without a splash. Maybe not in terms of power of the deck. But it has a lot of play to it, and many choices.* 




![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/events/2014/gpmos14/QQ-Lee-Shi-Tian.jpg)

*Lee Shi Tian: Mono black devotion, or Black based with a small splash. Cards like [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) makes it the best deck in the format.*

*Patrick Dickmann: If you have strong opening hands I think Mono Blue Devotion is the best deck. But the Black based decks are probably better on average, and can win even without a great opening hand.*
