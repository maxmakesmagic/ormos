ChannelFireball
===============






















![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/events/teamseries/ChannelFireball_Team2.jpg)


Already regarded as one of this season's super-teams, ChannelFireball is headlined by . . .well, everyone on the team, as by the time the next Pro Tour is under way, five out of six of the members of ChannelFireball will be Pro Tour Hall of Famers.


**2017-18 Team Standings**


*Note: An italicized team member score is not included in the team's total by event. Only the Top 5 team member results are counted, with the exception of the last Pro Tour of the season.  

An asterisk (\*) next to a player's name means that the player has been substituted off the team in favor of a different player.*   
*Any Pro Tour Pro Point totals in the below standings marked with a hyphen mean that the player's Pro Points did not count for the team's score as of that Pro Tour.*
