Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





This season has brought us one of the most diverse and exciting Standard formats in the history of the game. Decks like Abzan Aggro, Red-Green, Abzan Midrange, Esper Dragons, Mardu, White-Green Company, Red-Green Devotion, Mono Red, Bant Megamorph, Abzan Megamorph, Atarka Red, and others have all been in the running for the top Standard archetype at some point or another in the last ten weeks.



One deck has been quietly sitting on the sidelines, though. Sidisi Whip has failed to perform in a format that was either too fast or too diverse for the deck to find a proper configuration. The deck was perceived as invalidated by the community and some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And myth was resurrected by Pedro Carvalho in Providence last weekend where he piloted the elusive strategy to a Top 8 finish.



I sat down with Thiago Saporito to get his take on the Standard metagame this weekend. Saporito said that the format was as diverse as ever. He doubted that any single archetype would make up more than 20% of the field. He was, however, surprised by the number of players that brought Sidisi Whip to battle this weekend. As we spoke, a pair of Sidisi Whip decks were entrenched in a mirror match behind us in the feature match area, flipping [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor)s into their graveyards and popping them back into play as they re-bought removal spells with their [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s.

Looking around the room, it seems like Whip of Erebos decks have gone from complete obscurity to being one of the most represented entities in the room, especially at the top tables.



The deck has exploded in popularity. When speaking to a group of Argentines, they were confident that players would be on Sidisi Whip if they knew the local metagame and had the cards available.



Willy Edel has so much respect for Sidisi Whip that he actually named [Pharika, God of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction) as the most underplayed card in the format. He identified the card as a tool that Sidisi Whip decks can use to overwhelm control strategiesâ€™ removal, break up [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) combos, deathtouch grind other midrange strategies, and completely dominate the mirror. It may be a bit slow, but [Pharika, God of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%2C+God+of+Affliction) does everything you need to win a long game in this format.



A quick scan of the top tables reveals that Sidisi Whip strategies are rising to the top as we approach the end of Day 1. Will Sidisi Whip continue to reestablish itself as one of the decks to beat in Standard? Or will we see the deck struggle with inconsistency and opposing aggression in the second day of competition? Stay tuned for all the whipping action here in Buenos Aires!
