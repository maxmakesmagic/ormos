No. 3 Shaun McLaren sauntered up to the feature match area. Well, he might not have actually "sauntered," but when a player has such glorious hair, that player just tends to saunters everywhere—whether they try to or not.



 Perhaps that swagger also comes from his stellar finishes last seasons. The man won Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, then finished in the finals of Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*. Those type of finishes deserve some of what the kids call "swag" or something like that. Wait, is it "bling bling"? Or "bae"? I don't know, I'm old.




 Anyway, McLaren shuffled up across from Two-time Grand Prix Top 8 finisher AJ Sacher. Sacher has a little something to prove this weekend, as one of his finishes came at Grand Prix Denver back in 2008. He'd recently taken a little hiatus from *Magic* (as we all do from time to time), but is back in business.




 After shuffling up, AJ took out a couple cards from his deckbox and displayed them to McLaren. "Do you accept the conditions?" Sacher asked. The cards were three sleeved *Unglued* cards: [Rock Lobster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rock+Lobster), [Paper Tiger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paper+Tiger), and [Scissors Lizard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scissors+Lizard).






*AJ Sacher*
