Because *New Phyrexia* combines the plane of Mirrodin (from 2003) and the ancient menace of the Phyrexians (from some time back in the dawn of time), it's got some images that reference cards from **Magic**'s past. Today's example is [Mortis Dogs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortis+Dogs)!

Take a look at [Mortis Dogs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortis+Dogs). Really drink it in. Does it look somehow ... familiar? Here's a hint: if you started playing in the last, say, ten years or so, you missed its original appearance.
