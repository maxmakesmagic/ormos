In the art of the *Planar Chaos* card [Big Game Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Big+Game+Hunter), the assassin is shown cleaning his sword as he walks away from the corpse of the dragon he's just slain.

Note that this Human Assassin (also a Rebel, tutorable with cards like [Amrou Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout)!) has an effect that mimics [Reprisal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reprisal)-a spell originally from *Alliances* that destroys a creature with power 4 or greater without possibility of regeneration.

Dragons are apparently commonly in need of reprisal. Note that the *Seventh Edition* printing of [Reprisal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reprisal) also depicts a dragon getting (or rather, having just gotten) the axe.
