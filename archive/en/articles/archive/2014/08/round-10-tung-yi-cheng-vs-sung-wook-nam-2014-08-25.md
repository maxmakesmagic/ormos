Both players finished up Day 1 of Grand Prix Beijing with perfect records. Sung-Wook Nam is ably piloting Mono-Black Devotion, a deck he took to victory recently at Grand Prix Melbourne. Tung-Yi Cheng has piloted a R/W Burn deck over the weekend, the blistering pace leaving his opponents scorched and helpless. 


As the match unfolded, Cheng was able to take Nam's life down to a perilously low levels, but was unable to steal any games before the control deck stabilised and rode its powerful creatures to victory. This matchup is a race, pure and simple, between a flurry of early burn and the Black deck's attempts to stabilise their life total and use their superior creatures to take the game.



**Game 1**




 The first game was all about a flurry of early burn from Cheng, as Nam's [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) displayed a panapoly of [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix), [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and an [Ash Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ash+Zealot). Once the Zealot hit the bin, Cheng wasted no time in reducing Nam's life total as rapidly as possible. Nam managed to resolve a Nightveil Spectre and followed up with a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Cheng had enough burn to drop Nam to 5 in response, but had nothing for Nam's follow-up [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon). Cheng was forced to look to the top of his deck for answers. None arrived in time, the powerful 6/6 Demon taking the first game in short order.






*Cheng feels a little Desecrated.*
