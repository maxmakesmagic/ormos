With no events happening again this week, our eyes stay firmly focused on the top of the rankings, where Reid Duke still holds the slimmest of leads in the Top 25 rankings, but actually sits just behind Jérémy Dezani in the race for the [Player of the Year](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/events.aspx?x=protour/standings/poy201314).


The reason for the lack of new events? Why, the impending release of *Magic 2015,* of course. Every time a new set is released, the calendar clears to give players a chance to play in Prereleases and Release Events all around the world—and for the pros to prepare for the Pro Tour that accompanies the new set. In this case, twin Grand Prix in Taipei and Boston-Worcester on July 26–27 provide one last opportunity to pick up points before Pro Tour *Magic 2015* concludes the season August 1–3. And while we're all watching the top of the standings to see where Duke and Dezani finally land in what is turning out to be a battle for the ages, many of the players on this list will be jockeying for position to earn slots at the World Championship or the World *Magic* Cup.



There are unlikely to be many changes between now and the Pro Tour, but stay tuned for the titanic shifts that are sure to accompany that first week in August and what is shaping up to be a thrilling finish to the season.
