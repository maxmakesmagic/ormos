Dan Jordan is no stranger to high level Magic event. Jordan was a Pro Tour regular until recently, and, after this weekend, it looks like that isn’t going to be changing any time soon. Jordan has three Pro Tour Top 16s and two previous Grand Prix Top 8s to his name before this event. Jordan is armed with the popular Blue/Red Delver strategy. Despite the deck being in everyone’s crosshairs coming into this weekend, Jordan was able to overcome the hate and make it all the way to the Top 8.



His opponent, Royce Walter is a Software Developer from Syracuse, New York. Despite having little previous tournament success, Walter managed to secure the third seed in a field of over 4000 players. Walter is armed with a powerful Storm strategy that seems to have taken the tournament by, well, storm.



In the first game, Jordan got off to a fast start with [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) into [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer).

The pressure mounted quickly and Walter was forced to go for his combo. A well-timed [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) from Jordan was enough to force a second game.



Jordan 1 - 0 Walter



The second game would be even faster, with Walter actually winning on the first turn, before Jordan would even have a chance to play a land. A large chain of mana production spells and two copies of [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) gave Walter the storm he needed to fire off a [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) for over twenty points of damage.

Jordan looked to be on the table with [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) in the third game, but Walter used [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to strip [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) from his hand. Then, as Storm decks often do, Walter generated enough mana and storm count to fire off a lethal Tendrils on the second turn of the game.



Jordan 1 - 2 Walter
