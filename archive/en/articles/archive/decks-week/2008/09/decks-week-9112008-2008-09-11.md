The *Lorwyn/ Shadowmoor* PTQ season draws to a close on this week's Decks of the Week. We're bringing you the final Top 8s from the season as well as the master list to look back at all the developments from a fascinating qualifier run. As a special bonus, Rob Dougherty of Your Move Games sent in his Top 8 from his recent $5k Block tournament in Massachusetts. After some technical difficulties last week, we're happy to finally bring you *all* of the Standard decks from this year's U.S. Nationals and, as if all that weren't enough to keep you busy, a sneak peek at some of the future **Magic Online** content to come with a Premier event Top 8 from Block, Standard, and Classic. Enjoy!
