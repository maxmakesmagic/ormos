### Canvas vs. Prints?


The canvas versions are meant for the collector and true **Magic** enthusiast. Produced only in small quantities, they come in a black wood frame on high-quality canvas. For those on more of a budget, the prints come with a museum-quality grey matte and will be available in higher quanities. *Both* versions come with a certificate of authenticity.


### Are They Signed?


Both the canvas and print pieces are hand-signed and hand-numbered by the individual artists.


### Are They Unique?


These pieces are guaranteed *not* to be produced again in this manner. They will become available for online order through wizards.com in the coming months; we'll let you know on **magicthegathering.com** when you can make your order. And once they're gone, they're gone.


### Will There Be D&D Art Too?


Watch the [**D&D** site](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2006-champs-limited-2006-06-27-15) for details on what **Dungeons & Dragons** art will be available.


### More Information?


Watch **magicthegathering.com** for more information on the Limited Edition Collection. We'll let you in on the print technology used to create them, describe the UV protective coating and professional-quality mattes and framing, and of course show you what other pieces of your favorite **Magic** art will be available.
