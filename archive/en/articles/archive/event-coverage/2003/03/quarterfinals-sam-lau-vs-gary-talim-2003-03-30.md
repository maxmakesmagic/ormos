![Goblin Grappler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Grappler)The quarterfinals are upon as Gary Talim of the USA meets Sam Lau of Singapore. Talim has drafted a blue white deck, with just a small splash of red – Lau with a dedicated red / blue deck.### Game 1

Sam dropped a second turn [Goblin Grappler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Grappler) after opening with an island, as Talim, (who had gone first) played a morph immediately afterwards. His plan came to fruition as he trapped the morph with the old [Crown of Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Fury)-on-a-provoker trick, netting a [Daru Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Lancer). Talim was able to put a small wall down in the form of a [Whipgrass Entangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipgrass+Entangler). It wasn't enough as Lau morphed in a [Skirk Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder) to assist the grappler. Still short of land, Talim dropped a [White Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight), at least hoping to trade with the tiny thorn in his side. 

Lau had the [Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche) ready however, and followed it with a [Mistform Shrieker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Shrieker). Taking 7 damage a turn, not even the sought after 4th land was enough for Talim as he cycled a [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) into something that was nowhere near good enough to keep him in the game.

Lau 1, Talim 0.

### Game 2

![Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pinpoint+Avalanche)Lau locked Talim with the most potent combo in the format – [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith)/[Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). Talim had to play a morph after it hoping against hope that a second goblin wasn't forthcoming ([Nosy Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nosy+Goblin)). After that he dropped a [Mistform Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Wall) buying some time as Lau couldn't attack through the ¼. Talim put his first threat of the match out as his 5th turn [Daunting Defender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) was then followed with another cleric, an [Aven Soulgazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Soulgazer). Consecutive [Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche)s removed both the defender and the wall, allowing Lau to take out the Soulgazer with the help of a part-time goblin ([Mistform Wakecaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Wakecaster)) aiding the [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). With a [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) now active for up to 3, Talim could keep nothing on the board. A [Crested Craghorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn) was left with nothing to provoke as Sam Lau progressed through to the Semifinals.**Final Result:** Lau 2, Talim 0
