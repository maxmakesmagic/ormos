Dave Price and Chris Pikula were each voted in the Invitational and everyone agrees they'll make it a fun event. Pikula has been on top of his game all weekend - telling stories and making everyone around him laugh. (Pikula's game has very little to do with actual Magic play.) He entertained the crowd before this feature match by telling the story of the first round of the team PTQ where Deadguy earned its invitational to the Pro Tour. Price's opponent sat down across from him and said "I've got to play the guy who won the Pro Tour!" Pikula's opponent said "My guy won the Invitational!" Tony Tsai's opponent complained that "yeah, well this guy kicked my butt at a pre-release once." Tsai may be the least known member of the team, but Price and Pikula didn't hesitate to team up with their old friend from their days at Cornell and "the shark" can play.


Their opponents for round 2, who named themselves after the German translation of the card Flow of Maggots - Lyskavermaden - were Stephen Valkyser, Patrick Mello, and Peer Kroger. Mello and Valkyser finished 3rd at last year's team PT and everyone joked before the round about whether Kroger was an upgrade or a downgrade from Christian Luhrs. Kroger - who has a number of Top 8's on his resume - hasn't played as much in recent years and smiled that this was like a pre-release for him. Things got a little quieter once the actual game play began.


Deadguy went with the specialist plan when they divided up their sealed decks, handing Price the red-black beatdown deck that he hopes to be drafting on Saturday, Pikula got blue-black in the middle, and Tsai had the multi-color green deck in seat C. The Germans mixed things up, hoping to give themselves an advantage against anyone running that classic line-up. Valkyser had their red-black deck, playing against Tsai's green. Mello had blue-black control that was tuned for mirror matchups. And Kroger took the Germans' green deck into battle with Price.


Things went according to plan for the Germans in the Mello-Pikula match, with Mello claiming a quick game 1. However, Price managed to even things up despite his bad matchup. Even with a splash of white cluttering up his deck for anti-red/black cards, Price's Magma Burst plus Flametongue Kavu was more than Kroger could handle. Tsai's Collective Restraint slowed his own game 1 against Valkyser down to a crawl. Valkyser did his best to slog through on the ground, and it took Tsai quite a while to find a good flier to attack with, but Tsai did eventually find a Voice of All and Valkyser never could break through on the ground.

Kroger, meanwhile, had a Crimson Acolyte out in game 2 that was giving Price fits. Kroger then played Collective Restraint followed by Global Ruin and they were soon tied at 1. Pikula's deck delivered up yet another flier and when, with an empty hand, Mello accidentally stacked up Marsh Crocodile in the wrong order and lost his Croc it looked like Pikula might make the impossible comeback. However, Mello peeled Fact or Fiction off the top of his deck, apologized profusely because he knew he didn't "deserve" to draw such a good card, took the pile with Repulse and Sea Snidd, and suddenly Pikula was on the ropes again. Pikula played it where he would go down to one but stabilize the board. However, Mello had drawn a Tidal Visionary off the Repulse and that changed the math completely. Mello claimed his match 2-0.


Valkyser played an early Arena, followed on turn 6 by a Hypnotic Cloud with kicker. He was up a million cards, but Tsai tried gamely to outrace the Arena with an Aurora Griffin while Pincer Spider and Penumbra Kavu prevented Valkyser from attacking him on the ground. Valkyser finally took out the Griffin with Agonizing Demise, preserving his last 3 points of life. Arena took him to 1 before he could deal lethal damage, but it doesn't matter how low your life total is when you win. A win is a win and Valkyser was happy to even things at 1.


Kroger had his Crimson Acolyte again in game 3. Price tried to swarm over and around it, but Kroger also had his Collective Restraint again. Price waited patiently for Kroger to tap some of all of his white mana so Price could use his Scorching Lava, Magma Burst, or Flametongue Kavu. He was able to remove a couple creatures, but he couldn't attack (because of the Restraint) or block (because all his creatures were red) and that Acolyte quite simply did him in. Thus Kroger clinched the match on behalf of the Germans. Valkyser finished off the sweep on the last extra turn and the Germans seemed quite happy with the way the matchups worked out for them. They felt Pikula's deck actually probably should have beaten Mello's, but even if they hadn't gotten lucky there, they still would have won the overall match.


**Final Result:** Lyskavermaden 3 - Deadguy 0
