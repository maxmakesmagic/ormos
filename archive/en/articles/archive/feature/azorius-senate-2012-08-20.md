Azorius Senate
**My Law. My Judgment. My Guild.**
Also known as the High Judges, the Azorius Senate is Ravnica’s ostensible government. The guild considers itself to be the mediator and controller of all other guilds’ activities, even though most of its countless decrees are largely ignored. The Azorius Senate does wield real power, and other guilds are aware that if the Azorius had their way, they would be in charge over the entire metropolis. The Azorius’s reach has waxed and waned depending on economics, cultural trends, and other guilds’ activities.

**Isperia, Law Incarnate.** Sphinxes are aloof beings that value solitude above all. As crime and chaos on Ravnica increased in the years following the breaking of the Guildpact, however, its denizens demands for laws and their enforcement grew louder. Isperia decided that the need for her service trumped her own preferences. Isperia is advised by three arbiters, each representing one of the “Columns” of the Azorius: the Jelenn Column, which makes the laws; the Lyev Column, which enforces the laws; and the Sova Column, which judges the law-breakers.

**New Prahv.** The original Azorius guildhall was demolished when the Boros warship Parhelion crashed into it. Years passed in bureaucratic paralysis while the Azorius deliberated how, when, and where to rebuild. Only after Isperia had accepted leadership of the guild did the gears of reconstruction begin to turn. New Prahv is consists of three towering, three-sided columns that form a circular courtyard, the tallest structures on the ground in all of Ravnica. It is an austere, immaculate structure, elegant but unadorned. White marble, alabaster, and steel predominate. Broad, curving hallways lead to large chambers, each with an array of subchambers and offices. Because the halls and chambers don’t have many distinguishing features, visitors to New Prahv inevitably become lost without an escort. (The site of Old Prahv’s ruins has become a wilderness preserve.)
