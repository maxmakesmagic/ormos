*What was your favorite thing about the original* Mirrodin *block?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_alexisjanson.jpg)**Alexis Janson:** My favorite thing about Mirrodin is definitely the Myr—specifically, [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr), [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr), [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr), [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr), and [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr).

I found *Mirrodin* block draft to be a very fun experience for two specific reasons. I love building four- and five-color decks. I enjoy the puzzle of which cards to splash and how to balance my mana as well as the allure of using the most powerful cards available. *Mirrodin* block draft commonly lead to these types of decks. I also love equipping up tiny creatures and crushing my opponents—an experience that was new in *Mirrodin* block. The mana Myr were perfect companions for both of these. They enabled the multicolor decks that I love, and once they did that job, they were perfect targets for Equipment.

From a different perspective, I’ve always loved the visuals of mana-related cycles. Vibrant, heavily hued cards always catch my eye, and these cycles produce five different takes on a similar concept, each with its own dominating hue. Mana-producing artifacts such as the Myr are some of the most colorful, visually-appealing cards to me. In this case, the Myr also happen to be completely adorable—something to help solace you as my [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) picks up a [Sword of Fire and Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice) and smashes your face in.
