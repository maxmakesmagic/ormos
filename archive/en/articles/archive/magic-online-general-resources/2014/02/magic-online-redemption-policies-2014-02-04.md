Magic Online: Redemption Policies
=================================

Magic Online Redemption Policy:  




SHIPPING & HANDLING
-------------------


**Magic Online** Redemption Requests will be processed at the next applicable **Magic Online** downtime. This process can take up to 10 days to complete, so please make sure you leave at least one copy of each card in the set you are trying to redeem in your **Magic Online** account until your Redemption Request is processed. After the Redemption Requests are processed, they will be sent to the warehouse for fulfillment. Redemption orders will either be shipped via [FedEx Economy](http://www.fedex.com/) or [United States Postal Service](https://www.usps.com/), depending on your shipping address. **Please note that your shipping address MUST be in the same country as your billing address or your redemption order will not ship.** Please allow 1 to 3 weeks for delivery.  
  

Charges for **Magic Online** Redemptions fall into four categories: handling fee, shipping fee, taxes, and customs/import duties. These fees can vary depending on where you are shipping the physical sets you are redeeming.  
  
**Handling Fee:** For every set released after February 1, 2013, (including *Gatecrash* and all sets released afterward) we charge $25.00 handling per set redeemed. For every set released prior to February 1, 2013, (including *Return to Ravnica* and all previously released sets) we charge $5.00 handling per set redeemed. This charge is the same for domestic U.S. orders and International orders.  
  
**Shipping Fee:** We have two different shipping rates depending on your shipping address, $2.99 for orders shipped within the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) and $29.99 for orders shipped Internationally (all non-U.S. locations, including Canada and Mexico). These shipping rates are the same whether you order one set or one hundred sets.  
  
**Taxes:** You will be charged the appropriate sales tax or VAT for your billing location. These rates are set by appropriate state and/or country and do apply to service charges, such as handling fees. Unfortunately, **Wizards of the Coast** cannot control those tax rates and is legally required to charge them.  
  
**Customs/Import Duties:** Some products are subject to customs or import duties and taxes when imported from the United States. These costs will not show up in your **Magic Online** transaction, but are assessed by your local or national government as part of the importing process. Whether or not duty and tax are applicable is dependent on a variety of factors, including item type, value, and the country where it was manufactured. The duty and tax rates are dependent on your country's duty and import laws and can be calculated as either a percentage of the customs value of goods or on the basis of the quantity of goods.  
  

If you are charged taxes or duty, the charge is coming from your local government customs office. **Wizards of the Coast** has no control over these charges, and since the customs rules can be complex, we can neither tell you if duty charges will apply to your set redemption nor what your duty charges might be. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to ensure the item can be legally imported into your country. Please contact your local customs office for further information.  
  

As part of your potential duty calculations, **Wizards of the Coast** declares a fair value for any product we ship irrespective of where in the world this product is shipped. Each **Magic Online** redeemed set is assigned a declared value of $50.00 USD plus the set’s handling fee ($5.00 USD or $25.00 USD). Your local or national tax authority may assess additional value or fees against the shipment if they disagree with the declared value. Any subsequent taxes or duties levied against the shipment, including VAT, are the responsibility of the person receiving the goods.

**Note:** Since there can be a significant delay between the time you purchase your Redemption Request and when it is shipped, we cannot automatically provide you with a tracking number for your Redemption Requests. After your Redemption Request has successfully processed, however, you may contact [**Wizards of the Coast** Game Support](http://company.wizards.com/contactus) and we will provide your tracking number as soon as possible.



REPLACEMENT POLICY
------------------


**Magic Online** includes an innovative feature that allows players who have collected a complete set of digital cards to redeem it for a complete set of physical cards. If you have questions about the redemption process, [click here](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/93).  
  

All **Magic Online** redemptions are final. Once the cards are removed from your account, the order cannot be reversed and you will not be refunded for your redemption order. Redeemed cards cannot be returned to your **Magic Online** account for any reason.  
  

If you receive the wrong redemption set or your redemption set is damaged, you will need to file a replacement claim using the guidelines listed below:  
  

• **Wizards of the Coast** only offers replacements for redemption sets that are damaged or defective when purchased or due to shipping problems. We cannot replace products damaged due to use.  
  

• Damaged or defective redemption sets can only be replaced and cannot be exchanged for alternate sets.  
  

• We cannot accept any replacement requests more than 60 days after the redemption set was shipped.  
  

• **Wizards of the Coast** is not responsible for replacing lost or stolen sets.  
  

If you have a damaged or defective redemption set, please contact [**Wizards of the Coast** Game Support](http://company.wizards.com/contactus) to determine the best course of action. Often this will involve returning the damaged or defective set and receiving a replacement set. Typically we will need to receive the returned set into our inventory before we can issue a replacement.  
  

Before returning any redemption sets, please be aware that **Wizards of the Coast** will only reimburse the basic shipping cost of a set. Express shipping or additional handling costs are not covered unless specifically authorized by our Game Support team. We reserve the right to deny replacement requests and/or shipping reimbursement at our discretion. Please note that cards with minor defects or imperfections inherent in the redemption set printing, collating and packing process are not considered damaged and will not be eligible for replacement.  
  

When contacting Game Support, please include the following information:  
  

• First and last name:  

• **Magic Online** Login name:  

• E-mail address associated with your **Magic Online** account:  

• Order number:
