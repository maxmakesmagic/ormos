Block Format Deck Construction
==============================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)

*Updated February 2, 2014*

Constructed decks must contain a minimum of sixty cards. There is no maximum deck size; however, you must be able to shuffle your deck with no assistance. If a player wishes to use a sideboard, it must have fifteen or fewer cards.

With the exception of basic land cards, a player’s combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title equivalent. All cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest are basic. (The five *Ice Age* block snow-covered lands -- Snow-Covered Plains, Snow-Covered Island, Snow-Covered Swamp, Snow-Covered Mountain, and Snow-Covered Forest -- are also basic lands. Note that snow-covered lands are permitted only in formats that allow expansions from the *Ice Age* block to be used.)

The DCI sanctions the following Block Constructed formats:

* *Theros* block (*Theros*, *Born of the Gods* [effective February 7, 2014], *Journey Into Nyx* [effective May 2, 2014])
* *Return to Ravnica* block (*Return to Ravnica*, *Gatecrash*, *Dragon's Maze*)
