It's hard for a player like World No. 2 Reid Duke to improve on past performances. With the new Grand Prix cap set at your five top performances, it can become difficult to improve on past high finishes when you're as ridiculous as Reid Duke.


I know, I know, first world problems and all that.


But Duke has certainly managed to put up a performance to top most of his other GP finishes this year. Most. A win here would certainly give him a boost, both in the Player of the Year standings and in a push to be the top ranked player in the world. His devotion to black cards this weekend had served him well, and his double Grey Merchant deck was certainly packed with power.


Standing in his way is Frank Skarren who is secretly one of the best limited players in the world. Skarren has one of the best lifetime win percentages across limited formats on the Pro Tour, and is pretty well-respected among the Pro community. He was pretty happy with his blue-green deck during build, lamenting only a few missing cards.


Duke had faced off against aggressive decks throughout the Top 8, but Skarrens was a little less wall-to-wall aggressive and could play a passable midrange game.


And, as a bonus, these two incredible players just happen to be among the nicest guys you'll ever meet. Sportsmanship all around and all that.


"Good luck, Frank."


"Good luck, Reid."



**The Games**




 For the first time in the Top 8, Duke faced someone who could parry his blows with more than another 2/1. Skarren was even able to remove [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) right off the bat, following up with a [Nessian Courser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser) and [Horizon Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Chimera). In doing so, he actually pulled fairly far ahead. [Leafcrown Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) on the Chimera only pushed Duke closer to the brink.




 For his park, Duke wasn't doing nothing, but his something was far less impressive. [Fanatic of Mogis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) and [Disciple of Phenax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) were fine cards, but they certainly weren't stopping a 5/4 flier any time soon.





*Reid Duke has been pretty much unstoppable in this Top 8. Could anyone slow the world's second-ranked player?*
