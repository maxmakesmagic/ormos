Welcome back to once again to Sketches! This time, we're going to link up with the week's theme. So prepare yourself for an example of a card with imprint!

### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Scott Chou](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Scott+Chou%22%5D) is relatively new to **MAgic** art, with his nineteen cards starting in *Zendikar* block.

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions Scott was given for [Strata Scythe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strata+Scythe):


> 
> Color: Artifact
> 
> 
> Location: Tangle floor
> 
> 
> Action: Show us a Mirrodin-style scythe, sort of: a long steel bar with a gently scooped scythe-blade on the end. We see a golem using it to shear a layer of metal from the Tangle floor, revealing gleaming copper underneath the thick verdigris.
> 
> 
> Focus: the strange carver-scythe
> 
> 
> Mood: Harvesting verdigris or digging for treasure? 
> 
> 

### Sketch

Armed with that art description, Scott submitted a sketch to **Magic**'s creative team.

### Final Art

The creative team asked for a few tweaks to the piece, allowing the scythe to be the focus. And this is the result!
