*What's your favorite legendary creature?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** "Favorite legend" is bound to be one of those highly personal things. There are (\*does [Gatherer search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?type=+%5Blegendary%5D+%5Bcreature%5D%7C%7Csubtype=+%5Blegendary%5D+%5Bcreature%5D)\*) over 400 legendary creatures in **Magic**, and although some of them are [Rith, the Awakener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rith%2C+the+Awakener) or [Sliver Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) or [Ob Nixilis, the Fallen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis%2C+the+Fallen), others are, well, [Chandler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandler). Still, I'd be willing to bet, were I a betting man, that for every single one of those legends, from [Aboshan, Cephalid Emperor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aboshan%2C+Cephalid+Emperor) to [Zuo Ci, the Mocking Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zuo+Ci%2C+the+Mocking+Sage), there is somebody out there who will swear that it's the best of the bunch. It all depends on what you like, and on which cards you encountered, and when, and how, and what you did with them, and how well you know the storyline ....

That brings me to my favorite, hands-down: [Multani, Maro-Sorcerer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Multani%2C+Maro-Sorcerer).

![Multani Maro-Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Multani+Maro-Sorcerer)  
He's a \*/\*, an enormous creature waiting to happen. He's got shroud, so he doesn't keel over at the first sign of trouble. He just loves to sit down at a nice big table with lots of people who like to draw cards. And in terms of flavor, he's a wise old tree-type guy, and that appeals to me. I busted him from an *Urza's Legacy* pack forever ago and just fell in love.

Even though he speaks to many of the things I love about **Magic**, in some ways, it's a weird fluke that Multani is my favorite legendary creature. I happened to open him at exactly the right time, in exactly the right circumstances, to make a huge impression on me. It could just as easily have been [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+the+Firemind) or [MÃ¡rton Stromgald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=M%C3%A1rton+Stromgald) (which it was for a while) or [Uril, the Miststalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uril%2C+the+Miststalker). Even in the same color, in the very next set, [Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rofellos%2C+Llanowar+Emissary) briefly unseated the big maro sorcerer in my affections. Who knows? It could even have been [Joven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joven). (I did like [Joven's Ferrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Joven%2527s%2BFerrets).)
