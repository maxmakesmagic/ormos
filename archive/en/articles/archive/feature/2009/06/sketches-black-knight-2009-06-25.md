The challenge with doing a core set is that iconic cards need iconic art. Take [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight), which first appeared in *Alpha*:

For *Fifth Edition*, ol' Blackie got a bit of a revamp:

Now [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) is returning to the core set, and it's time for a new image. Here's the art description that went out to Christopher Moeller:



> 
> Color: Black creature  
> 
> Location: unimportant  
> 
> Action: This is the archetypal "black knight". He wears some sort of asymetrical plate armor, something akin to scorched brass, over a base of-rather than chainmail-black scales, perhaps fashioned from some horror. Show him on a black horse, maybe its ghastly, or breathes some, or has a skeletal head! He charges straight at the camera with a wicked-looking weapon of some kind in one hand and a spiked shield in the other -- a champion of evil.  
> 
> Focus: the black knight  
> 
> Mood: ruthless, fearless, merciless  
> 
> Notes: the horse can be undead, but the knight himself isn't.
> 
> 
> 


Christopher's first pass included an entourage to show that the knight was important enough to have a posse:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/219_bksketch2.jpg)Ah, now *that's* iconic. Christopher was given the go-ahead and provided this beautiful art, befitting a classic **Magic** card:

**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, only *eight* cards will have been in every core set. Over the weeks before the ***Magic** 2010* prerelease, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Regeneration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regeneration).
