At PAX East in Boston, MA, luminaries from Wizards R&D and brand teams hosted a panel that, to put it mildly, blew the collective minds of the *Magic* community.



R&D Design Manager Dave Humpherys, R&D Game Designer Ethan Fleischer, Senior Game Designer and creative guru Doug Beyer, and Global Brand Manager Liz Lamb-Ferro were all on hand to give a number of tantalizing hints about the next several months, including a number of cards from *Dragons of Tarkir*, details about *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*, and an exciting announcement about the 2015 set, *Battle for Zendikar*.



And you can watch every minute of it.



So tune in and get a glimpse of what *Magic* has in store for 2015.
