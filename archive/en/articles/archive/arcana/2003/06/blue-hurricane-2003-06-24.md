Blue Hurricane
==============



 Posted in **Arcana**

The "blue Hurricane" is one of the rarest **Magic**cards on Earth.


It was printed—in error—as part of a special reprinting of the *Revised*edition in 1994 (called "Summer**Magic**").


The set was never formally released, but a few cases of it were accidentally shipped to England. Copies of this card go for hundreds of dollars on the secondary market.
