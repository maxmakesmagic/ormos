Bennett led play with a pair of [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge)s and a [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite). When Bennett tried a [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), Cameron declared he'd had enough, and cast [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). Bennett rebuilt with another [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) and a [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire). Cameron cast a second [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), and Bennett summoned a third Overseer. "One day, I'll get that dude", Cameron muttered, summoning a [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura).


Bennett cast a [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) Idol and a [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), then activated his Seer, leaving Gideon unattacked. Cameron [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate)d the Overseer and used an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) to remove the Idol. Bennett had a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) but no further action.


Cameron cast a [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), and [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) began to dominate the board. Without a third land or an answer to the imposing pair of Planeswalkers, Bennett conceded.


**Cameron 1 – Bennett 0**


Bennett played a land and passed, then immediately cursed. "I may or may not have had a one-drop," he said, shaking his head. Cameron cast a [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on Bennett's [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) as a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) watched on. Bennett cast an [Origin Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) and a [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer).


[Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and another Nexus got their beats on, with the Overseer making the [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) more aggressive than normal. A [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) from Cameron helped stem the bleeding, but there was still a Nexus and a [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) Idol to contend with. Cameron's contention arrived in the form of a Pair of Planeswalkers. [Elspeth Tirel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth+Tirel) and [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) were enough to power him to victory.


**Cameron 2 – Bennett 0**

Bennett powered out the gates with [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) and [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) Idol, while Cameron stuttered on lands. His [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) slowed the beating down momentarily, but it was to no avail. Bennett's robotic army rumbled in, and Cameron scooped up his cards.


**Andrew Bennett 1 – Maitland Cameron 2**


"Mother, may I?" asked Bennett, casting a [Shrine of Loyal Legions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Loyal+Legions).


"Oh, no, no, no," replied Cameron, showing a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Unfortunately for Cameron, he missed his next land drop, letting Bennett's summoned [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) resolve unmolested. It went on a [Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere), while Bennett cast a [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), making his pair of infectious lands look far more intimidating.


Cameron dealt with one with a [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), then summoned a [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) before [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn)ing the other Nexus. Bennett had a [Shrine of Loyal Legions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Loyal+Legions) which was growing threatening, especially after he cast a second [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel). Bennett eventually activated the Shrine to summon a host of 5/5's, which stared down a [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura).


"Gideon dies?"


"Gideon dies."


Cameron cast a [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), then summoned an [Elspeth Tirel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth+Tirel) to join his [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren). Out of aggressors and empty-handed, Bennett extended his hand in congratulations.


Maitland Cameron wins the Australian Nationals 3rd Place Playoff and will represent Australia at Worlds in San Francisco.
