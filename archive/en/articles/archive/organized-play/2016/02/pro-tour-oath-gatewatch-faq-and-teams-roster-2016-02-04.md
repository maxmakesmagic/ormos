Grab your friends and mark your calendars, because [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/ogw) begins tomorrow! This Pro Tour will be showcasing the massively popular Modern Constructed format as well as the brand new *Oath of the Gatewatch* Booster Draft in action, as the world's very best pros, esteemed Hall of Famers, and first-time hopefuls battle it out over a three-day tournament for their share of a quarter-of-a-million-dollar prize purse.


Three days, over 350 players, Modern, Booster Draft, all waiting for you, starting tomorrow morning.


Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* Basics
=======================================


Here's the lowdown on Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*:


* This Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring Regional Pro Tour Qualifier winners, top Grand Prix finishers, Hall of Famers, and players who have secured invitations through the [Pro Players Club](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-players-club) competing for a share of $250,000 in a test of both Constructed prowess and Limited instincts.
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using two packs of *Oath of the Gatewatch* and one pack of *Battle for Zendikar* (in that order)—and five rounds of Modern Constructed.
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of Friday advance to Day Two of the tournament.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Saturday advance to Sunday's single-elimination playoff.
* Sunday play is single-elimination Modern Constructed with players using their deck from Friday and Saturday, featuring a round of quarterfinals and semifinals before the final match of the event.
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five. The quarterfinals will be played two at a time, with the live video broadcast showcasing the climactic games from each match under the camera.
* The semifinals will be played one at a time, capturing the entirety of their matches under the camera.
* The winner receives $40,000, Platinum status in the Pro Players Club (netting them invitations with airfare and hotel covered for Pro Tours through the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons and $3,000 for competing in each of those tournaments), and an invitation to the 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.

Three days of action. $40,000 and way, *way* more up for grabs to whoever wins. That's a lot of value, and that makes the Pro Tour a big deal for the game's best.


When Does Coverage Start?
=========================


You can watch all three days of Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* LIVE on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) starting Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (ET)/6 a.m. PT/2 p.m. UTC. Video coverage lasts until the day is complete. Follow our Twitch channel and turn on notifications, and never miss a time when we go live!


Joining us at the news desk are Pro Tour mainstays Rich Hagon and Brian David-Marshall, along with Marshall Sutcliffe, Ian Duke, Randy Buehler, and Tim Willoughby in the booth. Luis Scott-Vargas will also be joining us on Sunday, provided he doesn't deprive the audience of greatness by making the Top 8 of the Pro Tour (and if he does, never fear, since you'll still see plenty of him on Sunday all the same).


We'll have the handy-dandy Nightbot in the Twitch chat to help with moderation and to provide you with on-call commands for things like the coverage page, current standings, decklists once they are posted, and more!


Where Else Can I Experience the Coverage?
=========================================


Aside from video, you can experience coverage of Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* in other ways!


NicoNico—Japan's streaming service—will be broadcasting our traditional English coverage as well as a Japanese broadcast featuring the likes of [Pro Tour Charleston 2006](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/kajiharu80-puts-char-charleston-0) Champion Tomohiro Kaji, Pro Tour regular and do-it-all Wizards rep Masami Kaneko, and more!


[The official Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptogw) will be your home for our Draft Viewers—which let you see every pick from every pack and every player in our featured drafts on Day One and Day Two—as well as tournament reports, Modern decklists, compelling and more intimate stories from the Pro Tour, pairings, results, standings, and more! Writers Marc Calderaro, Corbin Hosler, and Jacob Van Lunen will be joined by stat-cruncher extraordinaire Nick Fang and editor this-guy-writing-the-article-you-are-reading, all led by team captain and DailyMTG Editor-in-Chief Blake Rasmussen.


The coverage page is also where you'll find photos from the show floor from longtime Pro Tour photographer Craig Gibson, as well as a broadcast of the live video coverage, so bookmark the page if you haven't already!


When Will Decklists Be Published?
=================================


As we prioritize tournament integrity above all else, we will be withholding sensitive information—such as decklists—until key points in the weekend. If you can't find a deck you're looking for, try starting Sunday!


Any Modern Constructed decklists referenced or talked about during the weekend will have decklists added after Round 16 is underway on Saturday. Top Modern Constructed decklists will be posted on Sunday, likely around the semifinals, and will include all top Modern decks from players that scored 18 match points or more in the Constructed rounds (that's a 6-4 record or better).


As for the Top 8 Modern decklists, those will be available after the Swiss rounds on Saturday, before we head home for the night.


Where Can I Find Out More?
==========================


If you can't tune in to the coverage all weekend, you can get the latest updates by following [@MagicProTour](http://www.twitter.com/magicprotour) on Twitter. The latest pairings, results, and standings are posted there as well.

Team Up!
========


Many players have been teaming up for these big events for a while, allowing each player to contribute their strengths and testing time to shore up personal weaknesses. It's a lot easier to find the right strategies and the best decks with more people contributing. Here are just a few of those teams, with Platinum pros and Hall of Famers listed in bold.


ChannelFireball/Face to Face Games
==================================


The traditional teams ChannelFireball and Face to Face Games have been finding some success working together in collaboration, and this event is no exception.

* Andrea Mengucci
* Michael Jacob

* **Alexander Hayne**
* **Ivan Floch**

Fabrizio Anteri is coming off of a win in [Grand Prix Mexico City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmex16), with Pro Tour winner Martin Dang following not too far behind with a Top 8 finish.

The Pantheon
============


You didn't see ChannelFireball's second team, the Pantheon, in any of last weekend's Grand Prix. That's because the Pantheon has always had its eyes on the biggest prize, and nothing will distract them from their testing. Comprising the game's top honors, including Hall of Famers Jon Finkel and Kai Budde, the Pantheon is a team that isn't solid gold on account of being almost entirely Platinum.


* **William Jensen**
* **Owen Turtenwald**
* **Reid Duke**
* **Jon Finkel**
* **Kai Budde**
* **Gabriel Nassif**
* **Andrew Cuneo**
* **Jelger Wiegersma**
* **Ben Rubin**
* Brock Parker
* Antonino De Rosa
* **Shahar Shenhar**

Team member Matthew Costa will not be at the Pro Tour, but was the team's representative in Vancouver, inching closer towards Silver status in the Pro Tour Players Club and helping the team get some on-site knowledge of the Limited format.


DEX Army
========


The Iberica-Latin allegiance formed under the leadership of Willy Edel and guided by some of South America's, Spain's, and Portugal's brightest, the DEX Army also put up a strong showing in Grand Prix Mexico City last weekend. They have had their sights set on toppling Modern, and are a team to look out for in the Constructed rounds.


* **Willy Edel**
* Pedro Carvalho
* Guilherme Merjam
* Marcos Paulo de Jesus Freitas
* Artur Villela
* Leonardo de Castro
* **Marcio Carvalho**
* Vagner Casatti
* Gabriel Fehr
* Rodrigo dos Santos
* Javier Dominguez
* **Antonio Del Moral Le****ón**
* Carlos Garcia
* Sebastian Pozzo
* Caio Amaral
* Bence Bokor

Thiago Rodrigues, the Super Sunday Series Championship finalist, may not be qualified, but he's still part of the team and helping them prepare for the Limited rounds.


Cygames
=======


Headlined by a Gold-level pro and the biggest *Magic* streamer on NicoNico—Japan's live broadcasting service—Cygames recently added a *very* intimidating new member to their ranks on Monday: two-time Player of the Year Yuuya Watanabe. Cygames might be mirroring the Gatewatch in size and recent team additions, but this team is composed more of titans than Planeswalkers at this point.


* Yuuki Ichikawa
* **Kentaro Yamamoto**
* Teruya Kakumae
* **Yuuya Watanabe**

Ultra PRO
=========


Team Ultra PRO emerged out of the cleverly named Team Work from around this time last year, featuring some of the game's longtime professionals juggling their weekend *Magic* careers with weekday careers. They are joined by some of the game's most renowned deck builders and will be one of the teams to watch when it comes time to seeing who will be most likely to break Modern wide open.


* **Bob Maher**
* **Paul Rietzl**
* **Ben Stark**
* **Patrick Chapin**
* **Craig Wescoe**
* **Samuel Black**
* David Williams
* Patrick Cox
* **Matthew Sperling**
* **Ari Lax**
* Tom Martell
* Mike Hron
* Rich Hoaen
* Justin Cohen
* Corey Burkhart
* Matt Severa

MTG Mint Card
=============


One of 2014's most dominant teams and one of the Pro Tour's most consistent finishers—despite having a rotating ensemble of teammates as players qualify and fall back into the Regional Pro Tour Qualifier rounds—MTG Mint Card is headlined by the Asia Pacific's most renowned player: Hong Kong's Lee Shi Tian. This Pro Tour has marked a big shift, as Asia's Pro Tour competitors have paired with Japan's Tomoharu Saito and Oceania's top pros, including New Zealand's Jason Chung and Australia's Paul Jackson.


* **Lee Shi Tian**
* Huang Hao-Shan
* Yam Wing Chun
* Matt Rogers
* Chan Sze Hang
* Chester Swords
* Paul Jackson
* **Jason Chung**
* Zen Takahashi
* Tomoharu Saito

Blitz
=====


Headlined by a World Champion but joined by many of the game's greats, Team Blitz features a close-knit crew of friends joined by fellow collaborators. The players on this team have put up some strong finishes last season, and it wouldn't be surprising to see a repeat at Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*.


* **Brad Nelson**
* Tom Ross
* Todd Anderson
* Ross Merriam
* Michael Majors
* **Seth Manfield**
* **Steve Rubin**
* Chris Fennell
* Gerry Thompson

East West Bowl
==============


California's Pro Tour regulars and the East Coast crew that made up TOGIT at the last Pro Tour have joined forces, and the team introduced itself loud and clear last weekend in [Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpvan16). They even got another last-minute team member for the Pro Tour in Eric Severson, whose Top 8 finish at the Grand Prix cemented Silver status in the Pro Tour Players Club, earning him an invitation to Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* at the very last moment!


* Alex Majlaton
* Pascal Maynard
* Ben Friedman
* Jarvis Yu
* Mark Jacobson
* Tommy Ashton
* Timothy Wu
* Nicolas Beland
* Benjamin Weitz
* Andrew Brown
* Ricky Chin
* Scott Lipp
* Vidianto Wijaya
* Adam Boyd
* Paul Yeem
* JC Kystich
* Benjamin Nikolich
* Eric Severson

Hotsauce Games
==============


And finally, led by last week's Grand Prix Vancouver Champion Adam Jansen, Hotsauce Games represents some of the game's more outspoken and beloved pro *Magic* personalities and is expected to put up a great show.


* Adam Jansen
