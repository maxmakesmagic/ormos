Qualify for Pro Tour Aether Revolt on Magic Online
==================================================

The *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) [page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers) has been updated with a schedule for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* PTQs! There, you'll be able to find a schedule of *Magic Online* PTQs that could net you an invitation to Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*!


Starting with the *Aether Revolt* Pro Tour Qualifier season, we are also shifting prizes for Top 8 players from the *Magic Online* Championship Series to the Pro Tour Qualifier events. Instead of each player in the Top 8 earning 15 Qualifier Points, players who finish 2nd-8th place will receive a PTQ Finals token so they can play in another PTQ Finals event without needing to qualify again through a preliminary.


Also beginning in the upcoming PTQ season, we'll be adding several new PTQ Qualifier times on Monday and Tuesday to accommodate different time zones and create more qualification opportunities on more days! Constructed PTQ Events will now have Preliminary Events on Mondays at 5:30 p.m. PT/12a.m. UTC and Tuesdays at 8:30 a.m. PT/3:00 p.m. UTC. Limited PTQ Events will have Preliminaries on Mondays at 3:30 p.m. PT/10:30 p.m. UTC and Tuesdays at 10:30 a.m. PT/5:30 p.m. UTC. Check out the [full schedule](#schedule) below!


If you want to learn more about Pro Tour Qualifiers on *Magic Online*, then read on!

What is the Pro Tour?
=====================


The *Magic: The Gathering* Pro Tour is a tournament series where legends are born. With four annual worldwide stops, the *Magic* Pro Tour is the premier circuit to play competitive *Magic*. Each event showcases a prize pool of $250,000.


Learn more about the Pro Tour [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-magic-event-types-events).




---

How do I qualify for the Pro Tour through *Magic Online*?
=========================================================


With *Magic Online*, you can qualify for the Pro Tour from the comfort of your own home via *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier events!




---

You can find information on face-to-face PTQ events [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/regionalqualifiers).




---

*Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers (PTQs) consist of a set of PTQ Preliminaries that grant tokens that can be used to enter a PTQ Finals event. Winners of PTQ Finals receive invitations to an upcoming Pro Tour as well as its associated Pro Tour Challenge.


*Magic Online* hosts sixteen Pro Tour Qualifier Finals following each set of PTQ Preliminaries. PTQ Preliminaries grant Constructed and Limited tokens of two different colors, **red** and **blue**. Constructed PTQ Preliminaries award only Constructed tokens, and Limited PTQ Preliminaries only award Limited tokens. Similarly, you can only use Constructed entry tokens to join Constructed PTQ Finals, and you can only use Limited entry tokens to join Limited PTQ Finals. Players may participate in as many PTQ Preliminaries as they like and earn as many tokens as they'd like. PTQ Finals tokens can't be transferred.

Speaking of **red** and **blue** tokens, Pro Tour Qualifiers for *Aether Revolt* will switch to awarding **blue** Pro Tour Qualifier Tokens on September 7. *Aether Revolt* Pro Tour Qualifier Finals will accept either **blue** tokens or the **red** tokens from the Pro Tour *Kaladesh* PTQ season. Following the *Aether Revolt* PTQ season, **red** tokens will be removed from player accounts, so make sure to use them this season if you've been hanging onto them!


**Please Note:** For the first week of Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Preliminaries, **red** PTQ tokens will be awarded. **Blue** tokens that are currently in player collections will be removed during the September 7 downtime and Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Preliminaries will begin awarding **blue** tokens after that point. Normally, this switch would occur on August 31, immediately following the end of the *Kaladesh* season, but it is a skipped downtime week, so the rotation will be delayed until September 7.


Once a player qualifies for the Pro Tour through a *Magic Online* Championship Series Playoff, or a *Magic Online* PTQ Finals, s/he is no longer eligible to participate in either face-to-face or *Magic Online* PTQ Events that lead to the same Pro Tour. Refer to the [*Magic: The Gathering* Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/wpn/document.aspx?x=magic_the_gathering_premier_event_invitation_policy) for more event eligibility requirements and rules.


The full schedule can be found below. You can learn more about qualifying for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*, as well as get the full schedule, on the *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier [page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers).
