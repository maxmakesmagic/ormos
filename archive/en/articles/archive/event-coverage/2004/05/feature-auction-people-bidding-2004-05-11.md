The competitors were in a great mood for this popular event, with lots of cheering, ribbing, and laughter as the bids came down. At the restaurant before the event many of the players could be heard comparing notes on favorite decks (or trying to play catch-up). The bidding for the early decks was aggressive from the start as players maneuvered to get the best deal on the decks they thought most playable. As the decks began to dwindle the bidding became even more heated as players scrambled to get in on the action before it was too late, fearing a blood bath as the last of the popular decks ran out. The bidding order is listed below, along with the bids for each of the decks and who ended up with each. (Only bids are listed, but you can tell who passed by checking the bidding order.)
