The *Odyssey* and *Torment* stories (and the card sets) revolve heavily around people called Dementia Summoners, which are mages employed by the Cabal to create fierce creatures for their pit fights. But there is no card called "Dementia Summoner," so where are they in the game?


Take a look at the Dementia Summoner reference from our internal styleguide. It shows all the planning and detail that went into these charactersâ€¦ and it should help you recognize them in the card art. Aside from the obvious (like [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion)), Dementia Summoners appear quite often, such as on the *Odyssey* cards Painbringer and Sadistic Hypnotist.

When sets are put together, art swaps happen all the time. Often a painting does a good job of illustrating the card it was comissioned for, but it does a *better* job of depicting a different card. So the art gets moved around.


The art for *Mirage*'s [Jungle Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Wurm) and [Barbed-Back Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed-Back+Wurm) make a good example. If we had left the art alone, the cards would have looked like this:

The team felt that the art of Jungle Wurm eating someone seemed more black, and the art of Barbed-Back Wurm crashing through a forest seemed green, so they were switched.

Pictured are the Booster Pack, four preconstructed Theme Decks (Sacrilege, Grave Danger, Insanity, and Waking Nightmares), the Fat Pack (includes six *Torment* boosters, two premium cards, *Chainer's Torment* novel, *Torment* Player's Guide, and *Torment* Spindown life counter), and the Theme Deck and Booster Pack display boxes.
