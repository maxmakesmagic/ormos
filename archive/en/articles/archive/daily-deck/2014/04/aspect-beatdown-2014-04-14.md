I've heard some rumblings of Mono-Green Aggro decks with the potential to compete against the big boys of Standard, but I was skeptical. After all, there are problematic cards like [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) around, but they don't always have it. Even if they do, you can kill them on turn three with a great draw. Barring that, you have Gods, [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr), and [Experiment One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One) to give you some resiliency.



![Aspect of Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Aspect%20of%20Hydra&options=)The one question you are probably asking yourself (since I asked myself the same thing) is "Where are the [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter)s?" First of all, three mana is a lot to ask, even for a creature as large as [Reverent Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reverent+Hunter). Instead, the deck plays [Witchstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witchstalker) as a great target for [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) and [Aspect of Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Hydra). In a format where nearly every deck has a way to stop you when you're trying to Aspect it out, having access to [Witchstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witchstalker) can be a godsend.

Will this deck continue to thrive in Standard? I'm guessing not, but it will be a deck that pops up from time to time. For example, RW Burn was popular for a few weeks until Mono-Black Devotion adopted [Staff of the](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+the) [Death Magus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Magus) into its arsenal. The format was still soft to lightning-fast aggressive decks, but one that can deal large amounts of repeatable damage is probably better than one that can just barely eke out 20 points.


Green-based aggro might not be good every week, but it's been doing reasonably as of late, so it's worth a further look.
