There are five different booster designs for *Lorwyn*, taken from art of cards in the set. The first one looks like this:

Where were we? *Lorwyn*. As you may have guessed, "Lorwyn" is the name of the setting—the plane of the multiverse—where **Magic** is going next, in addition to the name of the set. Next booster?

*Lorwyn* card previews begin on **magicthegathering.com** in September, but really, *Lorwyn* is best experienced in person, with cards right in front of you. The new set hits stores on October 12, so October 12-14 are the dates to remember for getting out to [the *Lorwyn* release events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases) at your local stores to get in on the party. That's a long time to have to wait for the big event, but the [*Lorwyn* prerelease tournament](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) should help get you there. 

*Lorwyn* shines in Limited as well as Constructed, and is full of surprises. So get ready for the newest facet of the world's premier trading card game. Until then, enjoy the final booster!
