One of the first cities in Japan to open its streets to foreigners, Yokohama is home to the largest Chinatown in the country, and its international connections are reflected in its architecture and food. The city is centered around the Minato Mirai 21 district, a business and commerce district that features the Landmark Tower, the nation's tallest building at 70 floors and nearly 296 meters. Another notable attraction in the city is the Ramen Museum.


Few cities in the world are as synonymous with **Magic**'s history as Yokohama. The first non-U.S. location of the World Championships in 1999 (won by Kai Budde), Yokohama has since hosted a number of premier events. In 2005, the city was again host to the World Championships, which saw the "home team" dominate with the titles of World Champion, World Team Champion, and Pro Player of the Year all being captured by Japanese players. In 2008, as the home of defending champion Masaya Kitayama, Yokohama was the site of the National Championship, which saw a resurgent Masashi Oiso take home the title. Come join us at Grand Prix–Yokohama 2010 and witness another chapter written in **Magic** history in this scenic city by the sea! 


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Grand Prix–Yokohama will be run over two days using modified Swiss-style rounds of 50 minutes each. The number of rounds on Day 1 will be determined based on the number of players registered. Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event.
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff round.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.

**Judges**
  
 The head judge for Grand Prix–Yokohama will be announced at a later date. If you are interested in volunteering for Grand Prix–Yokohama as a judge, please contact Ron Foster ([ron.foster@wizards.com](mailto:ron.foster@wizards.com)) by February 12, 2010.


**Notes**
  


* Grand Prix–Yokohama will be run with a KValue of 40. The Rules Enforcement Level will be Competitive on Day 1 and Professional on Day 2.
* The **Magic: The Gathering** Tournament Rules and the **Magic: The Gathering** Infraction Procedure Guide are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this Format Document. Rules documents can be found in the [DCI Document Center](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home).
* Players must bring pen, paper, card sleeves and appropriate counters.
* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

A player who has a bye in a round does not have to play a match in that round, but is treated as having won. A bye is normally given out to a player when there are an odd number of players in a round, but byes may also be rewarded to players for previous performance at a tournament or as a prize at a Trial tournament. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria *(Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players that accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds)*:


**Third-Round Byes**
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 4 or higher
* Players with a DCI Total rating of 2050 or higher. Byes are based on DCI Total ratings published on March 17, 2010.
* Winners of Grand Prix–Yokohama Trial tournaments.

**Second-Round Byes** 
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 2 or 3
* Players with a DCI Total rating of 1950 or higher. Byes are based on DCI Total ratings published on March 17, 2010.

**First-Round Byes** 
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 1
* Players with a DCI Total rating of 1850 or higher. Byes are based on DCI Total ratings published on March 17, 2010.

**Trial winners**
  
 People who win a Trial event are awarded 3 byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/grandprix/images/Artist_JasonChan.jpg)As a child growing up in California, Jason was a huge fan of movies, video games, books, comics, anime, and anything else he could find to entertain himself. In school, he and his friends began playing **Magic: The Gathering** and continued to play throughout high school. Throughout his childhood, Jason would spend hours drawing and creating imaginary worlds full of heroes, villains, and creatures—and not much has changed since then. Jason now works full time as a concept artist with Massive Black Inc. working for clients in the video game and entertainment industries. When not working for MB, Jason also does freelance illustration for book covers, trading cards, and other projects.
