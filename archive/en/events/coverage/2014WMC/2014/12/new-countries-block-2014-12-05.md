 While some teams around the world bring Pro Tour champions, Pro Tour Hall of Fame members, or even a World Champion, others are just beginning to embark on carving their name into the history of *Magic*.




 One team, the quartet from Colombia, were each at their first—perhaps of many—appearances in the World *Magic* Cup. How does it feel to be playing in it? The players from Colombia were unanimous in thought.



"It's pretty cool," said Sebastian Varela.


"It's awesome," agreed Jose Andres Ortiz.


"It's really great. I have a play mat that I have players sign, then I get to play with them," Varela said.


"It's some kind of dream; I didn't expect to be here," Ortiz continued.


"For me it's a dream come true," Jairo Alberto Parra Bedoya explained. "I come from a small town in my country. I got to travel and play with some of the best players in the world." He motioned to the Czech Republic team nearby. "[Stanslav] Cifka is here. All the people in my town are cheering me on. It's something I've dreamed plenty of times and to see it happen really is a dream come true. For them at home it's exciting to see someone from there playing."


Every team's situations is unique. For Colombia, getting together was a difficult prospect. "In our country it's complicated and we can't travel from place to place easily," explained Parra Bedoya.




*Team Colombia sported a team full of fresh faces excited to be here this weekend.*
