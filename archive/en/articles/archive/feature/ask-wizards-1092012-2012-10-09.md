 Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks! 



**Q:** Would sacrificing an [Overgrown Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) alone be enough to satisfy [Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jarad%2C+Golgari+Lich+Lord)'s "return to hand" ability? 



**A: From the *Return to Ravnica* FAQ**



 To activate Jarad's last ability, you must sacrifice two lands. It doesn't matter what other land types the two lands have, as long as one is a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and one is a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Even if one of the lands you sacrifice is both a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), you have to sacrifice another land that is a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) or a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). 




**Q:** Why don’t you have an RSS feed for Rosewater’s Ride to Work or the new DailyMTG Podcast? 



 **A: Trick Jarrett, Editor-in-Chief of DailyMTG.com** 



They are coming! Our current web site is not built to actually support podcasts, so we end up doing a bit of work to make them functional. They were done in the past and worked but that solution has actually changed and we're re-implementing it.


Hang in there, they are coming!
