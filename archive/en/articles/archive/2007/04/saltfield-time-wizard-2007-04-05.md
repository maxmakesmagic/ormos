The card [Saltfield Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse) was designed to be a throwback to *Urza's Saga's*  [Sanctum Custodian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Custodian). Instead of preventing damage, it reduces power, which lets it interact better with [power/toughness switching cards](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1255) such as [Merfolk Thaumaturgist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Thaumaturgist). Render a creature powerless, then flip that zero around to the toughness half of the slash—die, 2-power guy!

The Recluse's flavor text even references the link to [Sanctum Custodian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Custodian)'s "double [Samite Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite+Healer)" ability:


*He remembers a past of light and healing. But he lives the bitter present—parching salt, scouring wind, and the withering heat of the desert.*


The art was originally commissioned for another card, a white-aligned wizard with some ability to "stutter through time." You'll recognize the design of [Saltfield Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse) as being based on this shot from the *Time Spiral* style guide on white aligned *wizards*; clerics look slightly different and have a more rounded headdress rather than the tall tower mask.
