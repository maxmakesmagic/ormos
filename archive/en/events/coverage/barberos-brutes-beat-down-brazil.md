Barbero's Brutes Beat Down Brazil!
==================================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppor04/win.jpg)Barbero's monsters take the biggest trophy! In a final between friends Gabriel Caligaris could do little more that laugh as Jose Barbero steamrolled him with an amazing array of huge monsters. The Argentineans came, saw and took the two trophies. The Brazilians aren't too happy about it but for the second straight time a foreigner took their Grand Prix. And for the second straight time it was an Argentinean.


But the night belongs to Barbero. He won his first individual Grand Prix (he already had a team title from Grand Prix Amsterdam) and took home a big check.

Saturday, November 20 : 10:02 am - Welcome to Porto Alegre!
-----------------------------------------------------------


Finally, the Grand Prix circuit returns to South America!


Deprived of local Grand Prix for years, and after the demise of their continental championship, South Americans were forced to endure the giant leap from Pro Tour Qualifier to Pro Tour with no intermediate steps. The more resilient endured, but many went back to their "real" lives.


Today all is forgotten. In the lovely southern city of Porto Alegre, close enough to the borders to be invaded by buses full of Magic players, 343 players are ready to crack some boosters and unleashed the power of the Legends.
