In the battle of the 'manns, Patrick Dickmann met Wenzel Krautmann for a potential elimination match.


Going into the round with a record of 7-2, each of the two Germans knew he likely needed to win to stay in contention for a Top 8 berth. Or rather, for yet another Top 8 berth. Dickmann as well as Krautmann had some previous experience in this regard, going so far as to actually having hoisted a GP trophy this season. But whereas Krautmann could boast more Grand Prix Top 8 experience, Dickmann could boast more Pro Tour Top 8 experience, meaning Dickmann was playing for Platinum (which he could secure with a Top 4 here) while Krautmann had barely an outside shot at making it to Gold.


Dickmann was unhappy about his draft, having assembled a blue-green deck with a tiny splash of red and some fillers. Krautmann was on White/Red Aggro.


Game 1


After initial trades, Dickmann seemed to be able to stabilize behind [Nylea's Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple) and [Snake of the Golden Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove), while Krautmann assembled an army of [Kragma Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kragma+Butcher), [Dawnbringer Charioteers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnbringer+Charioteers), [God-Favored General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Favored+General), and [Akroan Line Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Line+Breaker). Dickmann added [Setessan Oathsworn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn) and [Flamecast Wheel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecast+Wheel) to his board, then attacked with the Disciple.


Krautmann took the opportunity to cast [Quarry Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarry+Colossus) and put away the [Snake of the Golden Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove), then came crashing in with all of his creatures.

Dickmann blocked and killed [God-Favored General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Favored+General), keeping his [Setessan Oathsworn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn) thanks to [Savage Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Surge). On his turn, he turned the Oathsworn 6/6 via [Flitterstep Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flitterstep+Eidolon), commenting, "Well, this may look really weird, but pass the turn."



Dickmann had taken quite a bit of damage and [Dawnbringer Charioteers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnbringer+Charioteers) proved a steady source of more. He tried to take down the 2/4 flier with the help of [Renowned Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renowned+Weaver) and [Flamecast Wheel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecast+Wheel), but Krautmann had [Ajani's Presence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Presence) to save it. Meanwhile, Dickmann had cast a [Vulpine Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath).


Next, Dickmann bestowed [Nylea's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) upon [Setessan Oathsworn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn) to create a trampling unblockable 11/11. Even the many life points Krautmann had generated via [Dawnbringer Charioteers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnbringer+Charioteers) did not really matter in the face of such a threat. A couple of attacks later, Krautmann was forced to admit defeat.

"That's one of the bigger creatures I've ever build," said a happy Dickmann. "I guess I played my [Quarry Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarry+Colossus) too early," frowned Krautmann.

Game 2



This was all about Krautmann's [God-Favored General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Favored+General). The unassuming 1/1 creature first survived a [Flitterstep Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flitterstep+Eidolon) block with the help of [Ajani's Presence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Presence), then went unblocked because [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) took out [Setessan Oathsworn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn), and finally emerged alive from being blocked by [Golden Hind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Hind) thanks to [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing).


Facing the General as well as six tokens, Dickmann picked up his cards for Game 3.

Game 3


The early game was characterized by trades: [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) versus [Golden Hind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Hind), [Swordwise Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swordwise+Centaur) versus [Stonewise Fortifier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewise+Fortifier). But soon, cushioned with 4 extra life, Dickmann went on offense with his [Snake of the Golden Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove). Initially, the race did not look like it would favor him definitely, though it certainly did once he bestowed [Nylea's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) on [Agent of Horizons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons).

Krautmann fought back valiantly and managed to create a somewhat dangerous situation for Dickmann—involving [Spark Jolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Jolt), [Flamespeaker Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept), and [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing)—but Dickmann cleared with [Triton Tactics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics). It didn't take long before Krautmann offered his hand in concession. "I just don't have any answer to a large unblockable guy," he said. Dickmann had won twice, at least in part, on the back of such a creature.
