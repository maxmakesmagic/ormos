 Harry Bradford started the tournament on a high note after opening a stacked Sealed pool, replete with a [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)—a high note which immediately sunk low after he lost his very first match of the day. It's been all up since then, however, as Bradford has lost only one match since, going 3-0 in his final draft pod with a synergistic Sultai deck carrying him into the Top 8.




 Tim Wu had managed to salvage what he thought was a mediocre Sealed pool with one of the standout cards of the tournament—[Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique)—on his way to an 8-1 Day 1 finish. After slicing through his first draft pod on the back of Mardu [Ankle Shanker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ankle+Shanker), he was able to double-draw into the Top 8 giving him some time to rest and prepare himself for what he hoped would be three more matches of *Khans of Tarkir* Limited.




**Game 1**




 Wu kept his opening hand, while Bradford was forced to take a mulligan. He settled for a six-card hand with some early plays in [Smoke Teller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoke+Teller) and [Glacial Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Stalker).




 After a pair of early morphs traded off, Bradford played a face-down [Kheru Spellsnatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kheru+Spellsnatcher), in the hopes of stealing one of Wu's spells at some point down the road. For his part Wu looked to go wide, casting in quick succession a [Leaping Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaping+Master), [Horde Ambusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horde+Ambusher), [Alabaster Kirin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Kirin) and a morph.






*What the casting cost on [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense)?" asked Wu.*
