**Name:** Carlos Moral


**Age:** 31


**Occupation:** QA analyst


**Hometown:** Chiclana, Cádiz, Spain


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


I made the Top 8 at Grand Prix Lille a little less than two months ago.


**What deck did you play and why? How did the Team Unified Modern rules affect your choice?**


Blue-Red Phoenix. Because it's insanely powerful and it felt like the best fit for my playstyle. It meant my teammates couldn't play Dredge, but I think they're okay with it now.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


It means I might take a trophy home. No ni ná!

**Name:** Sergio Garcia


**Age:** 28

**What deck did you play and why? How did the Team Unified Modern rules affect your choice?**


[Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks)—because it was the best deck to fit all our needs and it's very powerful. Thanks Kanister for the sideboard guide!

Humans. Didn't have time to play Storm. Sergio and I played decks without blue, so Carlos could do his thing.

Going to the Pro Tour with my friends!

**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Played six Pro Tours, went 9-1 in Constructed in Honolulu.


**What deck did you play and why? How did the Team Unified Modern rules affect your choice?**


Dredge, the best deck in Modern. Team Unified Modern didn't affect me because my friends are very good at playing every deck and they let me have the best deck.

It's an incredible experience for me because I hadn't played Magic in a year and now I return to the Pro Tour, and with two friends too!

Mono-Green Tron. Team Unified affected me a lot. I thought I'd never play a single game with Tron, but my teammates are insane with their decks, so I had to adapt.

Confidence boost to win World Magic Cup next week. Winning with friends is the best!

Bant Spirits. I think it's a very disruptive deck and the kind of deck I love to play. I was our team's "Vial Player," which fit quite well as my wonderful teammates have a lot of experience with other types of decks.

It's a dream come true. It's my first top finish and it's wonderful to go to my second Pro Tour with friends and teammates.
