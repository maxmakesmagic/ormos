Craig Jones is more often noted for his event coverage but back in 1998 he did win GP Birmingham. Tom Harle has done well at English Nationals before with a top 8 a number of times. ### Game 1


Turn one [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) defines this game leaving Tom with a hand of uncastable one-toughness creatures. Craig followed up with Aurioc Champion and [Loxodon Anchorite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Anchorite) locked the board down with Tom's Bruiser and Vulshok Warboar un-able to get through. A [Loxodon Punisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Punisher) backed up by a [Neurok Hoversail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Hoversail) quickly finished this game


### Game 2


Craig makes the first play with a Auriox transifixer and stasis cocoons Tom's [Leaden Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr). Tom has an [Arcbound Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher), which gradually gets big but is never able to attack. A [Loxodon Anchorite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Anchorite) for Craig again holds the fort and Tom is stalled again. Both player add more creature but can't seen to break though, until a [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) starts to push 3 though a turn. So it is joined by a [Neurok Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Prodigy) and Tom tried to answer with [Thermal Navigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Navigator) backed up by the [Arcbound Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher) and [Arcbound Hybrid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Hybrid). Tom tried to block and pump his creature but an [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) deals with the modular counters. A Vulshok Warboar tried to stop the [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem), but infused Arrows from Craig makes blocking very had and he forces enough damage through with the Aurioc Transfixed to finish Tom off


Final result Craig Jones 2-0
