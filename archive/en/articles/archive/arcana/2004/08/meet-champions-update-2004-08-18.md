I*n one far-flung corner of the Multiverse lies a plane full of countless stories: Kamigawa. Starting today on the [*Champions of Kamigawa* site](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displayexpansion.asp?set=chk&page=1&lang=en), you can read just a few of those stories about Kamigawa's heroes -- and in the process, you'll see many depictions of the world of Kamigawa, from concept art to card illustrations.* 

This week's story is "**[Mountain Secret](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/chk/kumano)**," by flavor text writer, published author and deckbuilder extraordinaire [Jay Moldenhauer-Salazar](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/authorarchive&author=JayMoldenhauer-Salazar). It's the story of an encounter between a gifted lone warrior and some of the mysterious lords of the Sokenzan Mountains. Enjoy.
