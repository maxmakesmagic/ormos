Dark Horses Roam Manila!
========================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmani06/champ.jpg)This doesn't happen in Asian Grand Prix. What's supposed to happen is a highly armed posse of Japanese Pro's storms the field, takes half the slots in the top 8 and then one of them goes on to win it. Here in Manila the Filipinos were having none of that. It's been over six years since the last Grand Prix here and they were determined to make it count. Half of the top 8 were from the host nation.


Takuya Osawa was the lone Japanese player to make it to the final draft. Also Osawa, along with former Australian Jake Hart, were the only players to have ever made it this far before, making the top 8 probably one of the most inexperienced ever. Experience didn't help either Hart or Osawa as they both crashed out in the quarters. This set up a dream final between two local amateurs, James Porter and Jiro Francisco.


Unfortunately the final didn't live up to the billing. A scruffy mana-screw and mulligan-afflicted affair, it was eventually Porter who emerged triumphant on the back of successive bounce effects and a [Leap of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leap+of+Flame) to take him over the top.


Congratulations to James Porter, champion of Grand Prix Manila 2006!

Sunday, March 19: 10:22 p.m. - Top 8 Draft
------------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmani06/b29.jpg)*The final table was set*
Manila has produced a strange top 8. As far as I know there are only two players who've top 8'ed a Grand Prix before. Fortunately they happened to sitting right next to each other so I decided to follow their draft.


Jake Hart is a strong advocate of the blue-black-red draft and will try and force that if he can. The deck he had from the last draft was just plain ridiculous. The Japanese have also said they favor that strategy, and Takuya Osawa did run it in the last draft, meaning we could have a little scrap on our hands.


Straight out from the blocks both players opted for the removal spell. Osawa took a [Galvanic Arc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Arc) while Hart took [Disembowel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel). Hart's next pick was a move into blue with a [Drift of Phantasms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms). [Watchwolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf) proved too tempting for the Japanese player and he further strengthened a move into green and white with [Transluminant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transluminant) and [Veteran Armorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Armorer). Osawa also pre-empted having to select a third color for Guildpact by sweeping up a few spare black cards: [Strands of Undeath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) and [Mausoleum Turnkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey). Bathe and a second [Transluminant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transluminant) rounded off his first booster.


Hart's first few picks were largely unexciting as the second pick Drift was followed by [Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) (over [Tattered Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattered+Drake)) and a second Drift. Fifth pick was better with [Peel from Reality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peel+from+Reality) - a card that Hart rates very highly. Another Roofstalker (again over [Tattered Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattered+Drake)) and Surveiling Sprites left Hart hoping for a good pay-off from Guildpact.


The second booster saw both players first pick [Last Gasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), but as both players major colors were different this couldn't really be classed as a fight. Hart got the [Dimir Cutpurse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Cutpurse) Osawa couldn't really support while a [Faith's Fetters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) made nice addition to the Japanese player's deck. This booster gave Osawa a couple of good Golgari cards as [Drooling Groodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drooling+Groodion) and [Golgari Rotwurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm) made his pile. As his deck seemed quite aggressive I was surprised at a third pick Carytid.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmani06/b28.jpg)*Hart and Osawa draft*
Other than the Cutpurse the cards again didn't seem to be there for Hart. This booster he mainly picked up filler stuff to round out the deck: [Goblin Spelunkers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Spelunkers), [Clinging Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Darkness), [Terraformer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terraformer), another Surveiling Sprites. The pay-off usually arrives with Guildpact and the fantastically deep Izzet cards.


It seemed on the cards with his first few picks. [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze), [Steamcore Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamcore+Weird), [Ogre Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Savant). But then the card quality began to dip. [Pyromatics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromatics), [Izzet Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet) (over a [Torch Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Drake)), Petahydrox. Someone else must have had a similar plan or the boosters weren't the best as the Izzet cards didn't reach their usual depths this time.


Osawa took a [Ghor-Clan Savage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Savage) as his first pick and then picked [Wildsize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildsize), Pillory, [Wildsize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildsize). Osawa has a lot of bears and with the two [Wildsize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildsize) and a [Gather Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Courage) can probably mount a fairly scary offence.
