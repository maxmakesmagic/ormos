For North American participants, there is also an exciting, absolutely free [sweepstakes](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday-sweepstakes) that you are entered into just by showing up to Game Day. One lucky Game Day attendee and a friend of their choice will win an exclusive trip for two to the **Magic: The Gathering** 2007 World Championships in New York City. Every North American participant ages 18 & over will be entered into the sweepstakes, and everyone has an equal shot at winning. However, if you don't show up, you can't win, so make sure not to miss out.


Check out the **Magic** Game Day Sweepstakes [official rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday-sweepstakes), and we'll see you at **Magic** Game Day on July 14th!
