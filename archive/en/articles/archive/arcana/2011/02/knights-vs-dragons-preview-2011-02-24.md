There may have been some confusion about *Duel Decks: Knights vs. Dragons*, which we announced [last October](/en/articles/archive/announcing-duel-decks-knights-vs-dragons-2010-10-11). Specifically, some people appear to believe it to be a joke, just because it's being released on April 1.

Allow us to be clear: this is a real product that just happens to be coming out on April 1. April 1 is the day we make jokes, not the day we make jokes *about*. Look, we even have a preview of the alternate art for [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary)!

*Duel Decks: Knights vs. Dragons* will be available in English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish on April 1, 2011 with an MSRP of $19.99.
