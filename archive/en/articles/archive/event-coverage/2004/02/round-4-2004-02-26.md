Gary Wise vs. Neil Reeves
-------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r4fm1_2.jpg)These two were teammates last season along with Bob Maher at Pro Tour Boston, where they placed in the Top 4. Wise and Reeves are primarily known as being limited specialists, but their constructed skills shouldn't be underestimated either. Both came into this round with 3-0 records.


### Game 1


Wise mulliganed down to four. He played [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) on the following turn, missing his second land drop. Reeves played a Talisman, and Wise brought out [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). [Flamebreak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamebreak) killed it off, and Reeves destroyed Wise's only land with [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize). He followed up with [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) and a [Megatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megatog), and with no lands Wise was in no position to put up a fight.


**Wise 0 - Reeves 1**


### **Game 2**


Wise summoned a Worker, and Reeves had a first turn land destruction spell in [Detonate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate). [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) gave Wise another threat, but he had to play it off [Glimmervoid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid). He cringed as Reeves took his turn, hoping that the Worker would stay around and he'd avoid losing his only land. It stayed on the table, and Wise played another [Glimmervoid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid).


Wise - "You're going to completely screw me up with that three damage card."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r4fm1_1.jpg)Reeves didn't have [Flamebreak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamebreak), and Wise continued to build up his board with another Dsiciple, [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). [Trinisphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) slowed things down a bit, but Wise already had plenty of threats in play. His attack brought Reeves down to seven, and [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon) came out to completely annihilate the board. Wise only had two Disciples and a new [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) to Reeves' 5/5 flier, and [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) made things even worse. [Flamebreak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamebreak) left Wise with no permanents out at all, and he conceded.


**Wise 0 - Reeves 2**


Williams - "Hey, you have no permanents in play. You're not allowed to talk!"  

Wise - "Better men than you have tried to stop me from talking."
