Sometimes, **Magic** art is straightforward and easy to parse; other times, it is more abstract, as it tries to capture a concept or an idea. Today, we're looking at the *Born of the Gods* uncommon [Dawn to Dusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+to+Dusk).

> Action: This is an abstract piece representing the lifecycle of a nyxborn creature - a creature created by the mind of the gods.   
>  One way to show this could be a creature emerging from the forehead of Heliod - representing the creature's birth - and the same creature shown entering the central sun-like orb of Heliod's spear, representing its death. If there is room, there could be a middle scene in-between life and death.   
>  The creature and Heliod should have the Nyx starfield effect.   
>  Focus: The cycle of life.   
>  Mood: Gods create and gods destroy.
