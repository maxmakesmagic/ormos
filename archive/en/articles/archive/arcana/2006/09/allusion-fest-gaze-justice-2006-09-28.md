*Time Spiral’s* [Gaze of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+Justice) represents a beam of holy light from on high, punishing an evil creature in an ultimate act of justice. Its cost and removes-from-the-game effect may allude to [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares), but the true inspiration is [Hand of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hand+of+Justice) from way back in the *Fallen Empires* set.

Note that [Gaze of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+Justice)’s flashback cost is the same as [Hand of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hand+of+Justice)’s mana cost. That beam is coming from a long way off—basically all the way from 1994!


Note also the big, nasty demon getting stricken in the art—John Avon used *Mirrodin’s* [Reiver Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reiver+Demon) as a model for it (but this is a Dominarian demon, so it lacks the metal elements of [Reiver Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reiver+Demon)).
