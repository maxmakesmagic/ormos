Live Coverage of 2003 Grand Prix Shizuoka
=========================================












After falling short of victory in Yokohama earlier this year, Kazuki Katou hoisted the trophy that eluded him then. His card advantage fueled victory over amateur Satoshi Harada owed as much to his Mask of Memory as his opponent's clumsy draws but he will take victory however it comes to him. Nobody was feeling bad for Satoshi Harada though. As the highest finishing amateur player his total payday was $3,200 when you include both prizes--Kazuki *only* won $2,400 for his efforts.


There had been much talk of an all 20th Century Boys finals with Ken'ichi Fujita and Kouichirou Maki in opposite brackets. Fujita fell in the quarters and Maki stumbled in the Semis. Nobody is feeling too bad for them either. It was a thrilling return to form for a pair of Japan's oldsters. They will be attending Pro Tour Amsterdam and you can expect to hear from them again soon.


The weekend drew to a close with the melancholy strains of Auld Lang Syne wafting over the speakers. If there was something to feel bad about this weekend it was the fact that it was over.
