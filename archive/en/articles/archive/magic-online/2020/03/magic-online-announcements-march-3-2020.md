Banned & Restricted List Update Window
--------------------------------------


On Monday, March 9, R&D will make an announcement regarding the banned and restricted list. *Magic Online* will implement the change on the following day at noon, March 10, at 12 p.m. PT.


When a card is banned or restricted, players using newly banned cards in leagues have until the *Magic Online* effective time to finish those league courses. At that time, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.

*Hour of Devastation-Amonkhet* Flashback Draft March 4–11
---------------------------------------------------------


Now this is a format with some eternal appeal. *Hour of Devastation* Flashback Draft starts tomorrow, March 4, and runs through March 11. In addition to the standard entry options of 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points, you can also enter this event with 2 Event Tickets plus 2 *Hour of Devastation* boosters, 2 Event Tickets plus 2 *Amonkhet* boosters, or 2 Event Tickets plus 1 *Hour of Devastation* booster and 1 *Amonkhet* booster. This event is Phantom—the cards you draft will not be added to your collection.


**Note**: In order to avoid a card-specific bug, we will be removing [Heart-Piercer Manticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart-Piercer+Manticore) from the *Amonkhet* booster collation for this event.
