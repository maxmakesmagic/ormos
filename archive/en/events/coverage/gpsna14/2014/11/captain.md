 As many connoisseurs of *Magic* tournament coverage already know, both the World Championships and the World *Magic* Cup are fast approaching. Taking place in Nice, France, players from all over the world are converging to battle and determine two different sets of champions. The World Champion will be crowned, and the World *Magic* Cup championship will be bestowed on a country, if their team can take down the competition.



As the festivities start very soon (the first day of the World Championship is on December 2), most competitors are already on their way to France, if they're not there already. Especially considering that Grand Prix Strasbourg is going on in the same country right now, for the most part, if a competitor were to attend a Grand Prix, it would most likely be there. However, that's not true for one manâ€”Grand Prix Mexico City finalist Marcelino Freeman.


Freeman is the captain of the Mexican national team, and despite the tournament being a few short days away, Freeman took a stop over in San Antonio, Texas to compete here this weekend.
