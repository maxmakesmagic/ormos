It's Time for Time Spiral Remastered

 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






*We've done this before.*


In 2006, *Time Spiral* was unleashed into the world. It heralded our return to the plane of Dominaria after a then-long hiatus of *three years* since the release of *Scourge*—the last story to take place there. The face of *Magic* cards had changed—updated to the "modern" frame—and we were met with a dystopian future where the world was slowly dying and things got *complicated*.

The story of *Time Spiral* block includes many characters, but the most important was [the return—and planeswalking sacrifice—of Teferi](https://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/teferi) that played out through the namesake release and its additions: *Planar Chaos* and *Future Sight*. Packed with flavorful callbacks to *Magic*'s earliest days alongside dozens of mechanics, it created a rich, complex Draft format.


*Time Spiral* block would be the last visit to Dominaria until, well, *Dominaria*'s release ten years later. (Things got better.)

It's easy for me to wax philosophic about *Time Spiral* because I lived through the experience. In wonder, I opened cards that looked old but were being printed anew—even if they weren't the splashiest of options.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Squire)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squire)
I fell in love with the reimagined color pie—a rebalancing of the mechanics and abilities of colors—that played with my *Magic* intuition and appeared only in *Planar Chaos*.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mycologist)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycologist)
I was in awe of the "future frame" that came with some of the cards in *Future Sight*, showing off full-art cards in basic Draft commons.

The era was defined by complicated interactions, interesting combos, and payoffs of some of *Magic*'s wildest competitive moments. But, like all other sets, it was an ephemeral moment.


*Time Spiral Remastered* follows in the footsteps of digital "remastered" sets to bring older gameplay to a modern aesthetic and match it with an experience that's as refined as it is nostalgic.

Each card in *Time Spiral Remastered* comes from the three sets in the *Time Spiral* block, selected to capture what it was like drafting in that era.


* [Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=108825)s! If you can wait three turns you can get *something* good, I think! (You need "time" to make it work. *Get it?!*)
* Sacrifice outlets! What good is a thallid growing saprolings without some way to munch them up and get something else out of them? (Dominarian historians can explain the dangers of a [Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=108825)-based economy.)
* More life gain! [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=108899) is somewhat efficient, and will get a hit in for you, but it's destined to *vanish* as a win condition. [Editor's Note: Insert a "time is limited/Limited" joke here.]

You'll have to wait to see other familiar faces for folks who enjoy taking time to find the win, but *Time Spiral Remastered* also brings one more nod to the past with it.

Every booster pack contains a card from a bonus sheet, select cards originally printed with the modern *Magic* frame now returning with what we're calling the retro frame treatment. Built beginning from the original frame files for *Magic*, these cards flip *Time Spiral*'s "the past returns" convention on its head—and delight players like me who love the throwback *Magic* look.


Gaining life quickly suddenly looks a lot better with [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate) around. You can be sure that just as *Time Spiral*'s bonus sheet added excitement for the unexpected in drafts, the retro frame cards of *Time Spiral Remastered* bring a new dimension to its battles with familiar faces sliding into the past.
