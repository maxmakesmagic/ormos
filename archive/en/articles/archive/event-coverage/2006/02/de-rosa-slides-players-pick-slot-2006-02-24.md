Bested previously in the Resident Genius, Road Warrior and APAC ballots, Tsuyoshi Fujita's ticket back to the Invitational was finally punched by his fellow teammates. Subesuent pass-downs moved Fujita into the APAC spot, so the Players' Vote invitation passes down to Antonino De Rosa.


Final Results:


Tsuyoshi Fujita: 24.51%  
 Antonino De Rosa: 22.13%  
 Tomohiro Kaji: 18.97%  
 Gabriel Nassif: 15.02%  
 Julien Nuijten: 3.95%  
 Jeroen Remie: 3.95%  
 Rich Hoaen: 3.16%  
 Anton Jonsson: 3.16%  
 Jelger Wiegersma: 3.16%  
 Alex Lieberman: 1.98%
