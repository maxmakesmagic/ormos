![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/fin.jpg)When the final match of the weekend ended there were cheers, tears and smiles all over the exhibition center, as Masashiro Kuroda held his wife, his Pro Tour Championship trophy, and the $30,000 check in victory. Kuroda almost didn't make it to this point, following his career trend of slipping a bit after an undefeated day one performance. But, he pulled it back together and fought his way into the Top 8, where his burn heavy deck dominated the competition. After his Fireball dealt the final points of damage to win the tournament, the hall erupted in emotion from the Japanese Magic players, who had been waiting so long to have their own Pro Tour Champion. Even the non-Japanese players stood up in applause and respect. Kuroda dedicated his win to the Japanese Magic players who had made it to the finals of past events, and said that he felt the championship belonged to them and the Japanese Magic community just as much as it belonged to him.

While this major milestone makes Pro Tour Kobe special, it should not be at the cost of overlooking Gabriel Nassif. Nassif took a format that many had labeled as "the Affinity decks against the non-Affinity decks", and came up with a deck that was powerful, creative, and packed enough "wow" factor to turn heads. His "TwelvePost" deck was the talk of the tournament, dropping [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) and [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel)s into play all day en route to a finals finish. This is Nassif's second constructed Pro Tour Top 8 this season, and cements his reputation as one of the best players in the world at the moment.


Kuroda will go down in history as the first Japanese Pro Tour Champion, but if the increasing success of his country is any indication, he certainly won't be the last.
