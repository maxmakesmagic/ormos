While at Worlds Week in Amsterdam, I had the opportunity to watch [seventy-one different national teams](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/wmc13/welcome) break down their Sealed Deck card pools in both ***Magic** 2014*  Core Set Team Sealed and *Return to Ravnica* Block Team Sealed.

I think I saw it all. I saw people with piles by color, by predicted deck choice, by power level, and even saw one team sort their entire twelve-booster-pack pool sideways on the table so they could fit every card in a long color row.

 I saw some pretty effective approaches, and some that could probably use some work. Why is this important? Mainly because time spent handling **Magic** cards is time you don't get to spend building your deck. 

I have a way to sort that works well for me, and I thought I'd share it with you this week.

Reasoning
My main goal when I am sorting a Sealed pool is to get a big-picture view of my card pool. I want the most essential, high-level information available to me so I can figure out what direction the deck wants to go in. You will always have those last few card choices to agonize over, but getting to that point as quickly as possible allows you the time needed to make the best decision.

My method also helps avoid common pitfalls like building toward a bomb rare even if my pool doesn't dictate doing so. I'm sure we have all opened some sick rare in our pool, built our deck with it in mind, only to realize halfway through the deck-build portion that our deck really wanted to go in a much different direction. Not playing a bomb rare is unfortunate, but it's often correct. My method helps make that decision early in the process so you don't waste time with a build that just isn't going to work.

Lastly, it helps provide some level of rhythm and comfort to building a Sealed deck. If you already have the motions down before you even open that first pack, you can divert a lot of mental energy to the task at hand: building the best possible configuration for your deck.

Let's dive into how I accomplish this task. You can use my method as a basis for your own, or just cherry-pick the things that make sense to you. Make sure you adapt it to how you think about deck building either way.
