Once upon a time, uncommon mana fixing simply looked like this:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Coastal+Tower)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coastal+Tower)
It was clean, elegant, and even occasionally Constructed playable. [Coastal Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coastal+Tower) and its brethren would be the perfect cards to reprint in expansions that needed uncommon fixing, except for just one thing: their names.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elfhame+Palace)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elfhame+Palace) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shivan+Oasis)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Oasis) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urborg+Volcano)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Volcano)
Shiv and Urborg are locations on Dominaria, so they hardly make sense on a place like Zendikar. And while Zendikar has elves that technically could have an elfhame palace, other planes we visit won’t always have members of that tribe around.


So, for Zendikar, and possibly future expansions, we created these:

With more generic names, these can, and probably will pepper booster drafts for years to come. Simple and elegant, and, likely, soon to feel like hame to drafters everywhere.
