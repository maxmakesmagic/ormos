**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpsan16/t8_silva.jpg)Name:** Victor Fernando Silva  
  
**Age:** 23  
  
**Hometown:** São Paulo, Brazil,

**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpsan16/t8_salvatto.jpg)Name:** Luis Salvatto  
  
**Age:** 27  
  
**Hometown:** Luján, Buenos Aires, Argentina.  
  
**What deck did you play?:** Black-Green Delirium  
  
**Why did you choose this deck?:** It seemed like the most well-positioned deck in the current metagame. A mix of advice from Javier Luna and the list that Seth Manfield played last weekend in [Providence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Providence).  
  
**What's the best card in your sideboard?:** [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind)  
  
**What's your favorite moment of the tournament so far?:** The first round of day two, I lost to Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa after making a mistake that probably cost me game one, and after that I learned a great play from him that I later used to my advantage in another Black-Green mirror in the tournament.

**Hometown:** Viña del Mar, Chile.  
  
**What deck did you play?:** Black-Green Delirium  
  
**Why did you choose this deck?:** It's the one that suits me best, and resolving an [Ishkanah, Grafwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ishkanah%2C+Grafwidow) with Delirium wins a ton of games.  
  
**What's the best card in your sideboard?:** [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End)

**Hometown:** Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
