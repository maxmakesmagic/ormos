Both of these players have played each other many times before and they exchanged quite a few pleasantries and stories of battles long gone past prior to the match. Just one handshake later, however, the gloves came off and it was on between Thoralf Severin and Florian Koch!



 Severin went with Blue-White Control while Koch had gone with Black-White Midrange. Severin said: "I already know what's coming... [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), good game..."





*Koch took an early peek at Severin's hand.*
