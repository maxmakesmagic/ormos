*What instrument (or role) would each planeswalker play in a rock band?*


**From Magic R&D:**


After much debate and whiteboard scribbling (not all of which is necessarily repeatable), here's a sample of the collective wisdom of R&D on this topic:


Ajani Goldmane – bongos; didgeridoo; classical conductor; double guitar  
 Ajani Vengeant – thrash metal (maybe he's in two bands?)  
 Jace Beleren – bass  
 Liliana Vess – singer  
 Chandra Nalaar – lead guitar; bass  
 Garruk Wildspeaker – drums, triangle; Elvish impersonator; rap-rock; horns  
 Sarkhan Vol – drums; accordion; lead screamer; tragic front-man  
 Elspeth, Knight-Errant – tambourine; concert cello; harp, zither; trumpet; violin  
 Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker – owns the record label; shady manager; DJ  
 Tezzeret the Seeker – keyboard; theremin; turntables ("WHEELS OF STEEL")


There were even more opinions listed, some serious and some less so. A few people even hazarded some guesses about earlier planeswalkers like Urza ("long lost recordings on a 78"). And we never did decide whether we were trying to squeeze them all into one band or to match each planeswalker to the most appropriate musical style. What do you think?
