Welcome to another edition of Sketches! Since it's ***Magic** 2011* season, let's take a look at a brand new card, okay? Great! Say hello to Water Servant!

  
### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Igor Kieryluk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Igor+Kieryluk%22%5d) has illustrated thirteen **Magic** cards through *Rise of the Eldrazi*, and there's another two coming in ***Magic** 2011*.

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Igor for this new water elemental


> 
> Color: Blue creature
> 
> 
> Location: A pool or seaside
> 
> 
> Action: This is a classic water elemental, a 10-foot-tall creature made from living water. It has a discernible head, perhaps with a normal crab inside it that almost makes a 'face' shape, but the rest of its body bends and twists fluidly, forming strong tendrils that look like they could knock you over. 
> 
> 
> Focus: The water elemental
> 
> 
> Mood: Malleable, looming, fluid
> 
> 
> 

The next step is for the artist to submit sketches of his or her vision of the art description.

### Sketches

Here's Igor's initial sketch.

The creative team thought that looked great and gave Igor the go-ahead for the final version
