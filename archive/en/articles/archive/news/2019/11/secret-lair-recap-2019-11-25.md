Secret Lair Recap

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Have you ever wondered what *Magic: The Gathering* cards would look like if the imaginations of artists were completely unleashed?


It's time to let you in on the secret. *Secret Lair*.


![Secret Lair packaging](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/BgNr6kxq7b.jpg)


*Secret Lair* is a *Magic: The Gathering* brand unlike anything in the history of the game. It's a love letter for *Magic* fans, with eye-popping designs and never-before-seen art styles. We're kicking off *Secret Lair* with unique "drops" in the form of timeboxed-to-demand (we'll explain what that means later) collectible card drops made with care for the community by the fans inside Wizards of the Coast, starting on December 2 timed to each day of the week—and if you miss one drop, it's gone forever!




---

**The *Secret Lair* drops in 2019 will come with the contents below, as well as a code for unique card sleeves on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* and a unique code from *Magic: The Gathering Online* for a non-foil digital version of that drop (the drops with tokens have a little something extra, which will be listed below).**




---

You can only get them on secretlair.wizards.com (be sure to sign up early to be notified when drops go on sale!). And this drop is only the beginning—*Secret Lair* adds new flair and excitement to *Magic* that will continue getting weirder, and cooler, in 2020.


There's a bunch of stuff to know about how you can order *Secret Lair* products during the December 2–9 *Drop Series*, but we want to show you what those things are first. If you've already seen all of today's reveals, you can skip to the [How Do I Get *Secret Lair*](#howtoget) section. But if you're here to see all of the cool designs, scroll right on down.


All times are PST.

Will I Get This For The Holidays?
=================================


That’s a solid maybe from us. It depends on what holiday and when you order!


For *Secret Lair*, the online store will indicate whether your expected arrival date falls in December or January. This is based on when you order and if we already have enough product in stock to fulfill said order. We're pretty sure these drops are awesome, so we've pre-printed a number of these to fulfill the first batch of orders pretty close to right away. So if you live in North America and you order early enough, your order will indicate that your shipment will arrive in December 2019. Otherwise, it will say January 2020. Which, to be fair, is in plenty of time for Valentine's Day.


How Do I Get *Secret Lair*
==========================


Got all that? Have your calendar marked for when your favorite one goes on sale? Now let's get into the details of how to go about getting your *Secret Lair* drop.


First of all, each drop will be timeboxed-to-demand collectible card drops for exactly 24 hours. That means, if you order during the 24-hour window for the drop you want—you'll get it! We are limiting people to 10 copies of each drop, but we're guaranteeing that all orders will get a copy. 


In addition to the 24-hour drop window, we also have a bundle of all seven drops available for 24 hours starting December 2 at 9 a.m. PST. You can order all seven drops at once for $199.99 (they would be $229.93 if ordered separately). Here's a handy chart:
