Both players were undefeated heading in to the final round. Sewell was piloting a relatively traditional Mono-Black deck, while Wei wielded an Esper control deck featuring the usual suspects. Sewell started well, summoning the eponymous [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), but stalled on mana, missing his third land drop. Wei, having had 3 scry lands in a row to set out his plays, considered how to best take advantage of Sewell's tempo hiccough.


Wei used an [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) to pop the [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s on the top of Sewell's deck, trying to further deny him access to mana. Sewell made the somewhat unusual play of killing his own Rat with a [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh) to keep his draws unmanipulated. His third land appeared and he tried an [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), which Wei stopped cold with a [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate).

A [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Sewell revealed an Elspeth and a [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), with Wei sitting on 5 lands and with more in hand. Sewell took the Elspeth and followed up over the next turns with a [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) and a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), while Wei was content to let Sewell play out his threats and fire off a mid-sized Revelation for 4.


Sewell attacked with his Demon and [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie), knocking Wei to 12 life. Wei had a grip full of cards but nothing on the board to slow Sewell down. A [Fated Retribution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Retribution) cleared out both of Sewell's threats, and Wei followed up with a [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and then an [Ã†therling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling). Sewell was holding a trio of [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight)s and played what defence he could, but the singular win condition proved too difficult to take down.

Wei opened the second game with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), stripping Sewell of his own discard spell, but leaving him free to cast a turn 2 [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat). Wei had nothing on his second turn while Sewell cracked in with his Rat and made a token. Wei had a [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) to stave off the army of Rats. Sewell followed up with an [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), while Wei had a [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) to start racing back.

Sewell kept pace with a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon). Wei summoned an Elspeth, whose Soldiers kept the [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) occupied while the [Blood Baron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) went to town. Sewell did what he could, but Wei's two powerhouse cards kept him in control of the game and won him the match a few turns later.
