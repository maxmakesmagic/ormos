2010 United States National Championship

Utter-Leyton Crowned U.S. Champ
===============================




August 20-22, 2010












2010 United States National Championship
----------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/usnat10/usnats_top4.jpg)And there we go! After three days of play, the United States has a new national champion! Josh Utter-Leyton had a long road to victory, but his Standard play carried him all the way to the finals without dropping a match. Joining him on this year’s US National team are his finals opponent, Anthony Eason, who burned through the field with his monored Standard deck and two red-based Draft decks on the way to his second place finish, and Conrad Kolos, who had to defeat the top-seeded David Ochoa in the third place playoff to earn his spot. All in all, the United States has put together quite the solid team. We’ll have to wait until December to see if they are able to make a splash at Worlds in Chiba!
