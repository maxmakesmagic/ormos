What better place then to hold a Legacy format Grand Prix? What better time than the week of celebrating our independence? 


Last year's Grand Prix in Atlanta broke a format attendance record. The questions are what new achievements and what new experiences will you and your friends be a part of creating this year in Atlanta? To start, we have added Friday Last-Chance Grand Prix Trials in different formats to include Standard and Sealed Deck, along with Legacy. We have added multiple $1,000 public events over the weekend in different formats. Plus there's an amazingly low room rate in our discounted room block at the event hotel of only $99. Special guests include in Matt Tabak from Wizards of the Coast and artists Rob Alexander and rk post. Join your friends for an epic set of experiences in Atlanta this summer that will be remembered by all. 



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2012).*

**Tournament Format**
  


* [Legacy](/en/node/704561)
* Decklists are required ([download blank decklist PDF](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/CONSTRUCTED_DECKLIST.pdf)).
* Each Player must use the same deck on Day 2 that he or she used on Day 1.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

One of the first hurdles of attending any major city is simply getting there! Luckily for travelers, Atlanta is one of the most accessible cities in the world by plane, train, automobile, and bus.


For those of you planning on spending some time in Atlanta sight-seeing, we strongly encourage you to get a map of the city prior to arriving. Atlanta is well-known for its nonstandard layout, and its fondness for naming streets either "Peachtree" or "Piedmont."


**Air Travel**


Hartsfield International Airport (Airport Code ATL), just fifteen minutes south of downtown Atlanta or about 12 miles from the hotel, is a two-hour flight (or less) from 80% of the population of the United States and is the international hub for Delta Airlines.


**Airport sites**
  


* [Hartsfield International Airport Official Site](http://www.atlanta-airport.com/)
* [FAA's official Hartsfield site](http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyFAA/flyfaaindex.html?ARPT=ATL) (includes major flight delays)

**Automotive Travel**


**Parking:** There is very little free parking in downtown Atlanta but we have arranged a discounted valet parking fee for **Magic**  Players at the Hyatt of only $20 a day. Other parking options exist nearby at various rates.


**Quick Reference Driving Directions:** When traveling northbound on 75/85, driving from Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport or traveling on Interstate 20 you should take 75/85 North to the right-hand exit of 248-C (International Blvd). Turn left onto International Blvd, then turn right at the third traffic light onto Peachtree Center Avenue. Hyatt Regency Atlanta's Motor Lobby entrance is one block on the left.


When traveling southbound on 75/85 or the GA 400, take exit 249-C (Williams Street). Go straight off exit and at the fourth traffic light, turn left onto Harris Street. Then take the third left onto Peachtree Center Avenue. The Hyatt Regency Atlanta hotel entrance is on the left. 


**MARTA Public Transportation**
  
 Atlanta boasts the second-highest rated public transportation system in North America. The **M**etropolitan **A**tlanta **R**apid **T**ransit **A**uthority ([MARTA](http://www.itsmarta.com/)) provides rapid rail service directly from Hartsfield International Airport to the Peachtree Center Rail Station. This station, "carved from the very living rock" ninety feet below Peachtree Street in downtown, is directly connected to the Hyatt Regency through the Peachtree Center Mall and Food Court. The entire walk is covered and almost entirely climate-controlled. The one-way MARTA fare anywhere on the system is $2.50. The MARTA rail system shuts down sometimes from about 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. for track inspection and maintenance, so plan to take alternate transportation to downtown (hotel shuttle, cab, rental car) if you're arriving or departing in the wee hours of the morning.


**When Traveling via MARTA from the Airport:** 
  
 Take the northbound train to the Peachtree Center Station stop, one stop north of the Five Points transfer station. Exit the train and take the escalator up towards Peachtree Center Mall. Once inside the mall, follow the signs to the covered walkway into the Hyatt hotel.
