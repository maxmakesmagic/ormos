The original design file for *Legends* contained *six* full cycles of creatures representing the six different pieces in chess. Each color had a Pawn, a Rook, a Knight, a Queen, and a King that were identical across the colors; for example, the red King and the blue King did exactly the same thing.

Almost all the pieces were cut in development, and while a few of the abilities were used elsewhere (the green Rook inspired [Jacques le Vert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jacques+le+Vert), for instance), only the green Pawn made it through relatively unscathed. Its mana cost was changed from ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) to ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) (in those days 2G meant two mana, one of which was green), and it was given protection from black and renamed [Whirling Dervish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirling+Dervish).

Below is the playtest sheet for the red and green chess pieces for your perusal. The other three colors were exactly the same.
