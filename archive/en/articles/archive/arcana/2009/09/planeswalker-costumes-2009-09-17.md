Halloween is a little over a month away, which means it's time to start thinking about your costume. Are you thinking about it? Good! Because this is another in our series of Arcanas featuring people in **Magic**-inspired costumes. We've shown [Wizards employees](/en/articles/archive/magic-convention-costumes-2008-05-19) (from 1995 or so) and [fans](/en/articles/archive/efficient-costuming-2009-01-14) (at PAX 2008), and now it's time to check out the state of **Magic** costume design!

At the [**Magic** party at PAX 2009](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-prerelease-promos-2009-09-16), we had people roaming the crowd in Planeswalker costumes. But they weren't just *any* costumes, because they had helpful fold-down chest panels to allow the people in the costumes to give **Magic** demos while maintaining their strict roaming schedule. Check it out!
