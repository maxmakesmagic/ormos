Between them, [Grand Prix Strasbourg](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpstr14), [Grand Prix San Antonio](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsna14), the [World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WMC), and the [World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC) meant tons of drama, tons of Pro Points, and tons of changes in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Let's take a look!



There were some huge moves, but none greater than the seven places gained by *repeat* World Champion Shahar Shenhar of Israel, who will surely now end the year inside the Top 10, currently at No. 7. It looked for a long time as if he might do the fabled double of individual world champion title and World *Magic* Cup winner, but Team Israel came up short in the second round of pool play, finishing in a still-creditable Top 16 berth. Shenhar's opponent in the World Championship final, Patrick Chapin, also benefitted from his run, up four places to No. 15. Yuuki Ichikawa also gained four spots to No. 21, while his countrymen Yuuya Watanabe (up three at No. 6) and Kentaro Yamamoto (new at No. 18) both made it to the semifinals.



There were other notable moves. Ivan Floch played in both tournaments of Worlds Week, as did Canada's Shaun McLaren, and both rose. Floch now has only Owen Turtenwald ahead of him in the rankings, while McLaren is only a couple of points back at No. 3. Speaking of Turtenwald, he will now end the calendar year as a deserved No. 1 in the rankings—his Team USA battled all the way to the Top 4 of the World *Magic* Cup before being bested by Greece.



In addition to Yamamoto, two familiar faces returned to the rankings. Brazil's Willy Edel led his team to the Top 8 of the World *Magic* Cup, seeing him enter the table at No. 17, while the French Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy battled his way through the "toughest tournament I've ever played in" at the World Championship to rejoin the Top 25 at No. 24.



With the dust settling, there's just time to see if Grand Prix in Milan (Modern) and Baltimore (*Khans of Tarkir* Limited) can shift the ever-changing landscape of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Join us next week to find out!
