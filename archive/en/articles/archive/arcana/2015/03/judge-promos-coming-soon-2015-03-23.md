The next batch of Judge promos is coming soon, and, as usual, they're a spicy lot.



Judge promos, as you may or may not be aware, are special promotional cards given to judges as part of their participation in the program. For more information on the judge program, we have [a handy web page with just the information you're looking for](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/resources/judges).



But if you're just here to check out the pretty pictures, well, we can't blame you for that either. Check out what the men and women in the judge corps will be seeing come their way in the near future.
