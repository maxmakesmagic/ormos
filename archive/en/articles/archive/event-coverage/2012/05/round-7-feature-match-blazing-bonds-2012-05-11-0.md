By now, Shouta Yasooka should be a familiar name. I mentioned him earlier when I broke down the Players Championsip standings. I talked about how, despite the enormity of his resume, the Japanese community feels as though he remains both underrated and relatively unknown outside of Japan. I hope for the sake of anyone that sits across from him at a table that this is no longer the case. Especially Tomek Pedrakowski, his Round 7 opponent.

*Tomek Predakowski and Shouta Yasooka are both players you do not want to underestimate.*

Pedrakowski is a former Polish National team member with Top 16 and Top 32 finishes at Worlds. Qualifying for this event by virtue of his Level 3 Pro Club standing, and he has played enough high level **Magic** to know not to sell anyone short, especially the Japanese player sitting across from him that looks strangely familiar for some reason...


### Game 1


Yasooka started with a mulligan to six...and followed it up with two more mulligans, eventually starting on only four cards. Pedrakowski managed to stick on six cards, avoiding a trip any lower. Yasooka's opening grip of three lands and a [Scroll of Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+of+Avacyn) turned into a third-turn [Fervent Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fervent+Cathar) that soon picked up a [Call to Serve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Serve).

*Yasooka struggles to recover from his mulligan to four.*

Pedrakowski, on the other side, started with a blazing [Wingcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingcrafter) into [Fervent Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fervent+Cathar). He even had a [Mist Raven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Raven) to remove Yasooka's flying Cathar, grounding it. When Pedrakowski added a fourth creature to his side on the following turn, Yasooka folded in the face of the three fliers he was facing, content to try again, this time with more cards.

### Game 2


While that was undoubtedly a game that Yasooka would love to have back, one of the things that makes **Magic** great is the touch of randomness inherent in it. Unfortunately for Yasooka, a whole lot of randomness seemed to happen all at once for him.


Fortunately, his opening draw in the second game was far more palatable, opening once more with a [Scroll of Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+of+Avacyn), followed by a [Thraben Valiant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Valiant). Pedrakowski had a [Kruin Striker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Striker) for his turn, and it immediately traded with the Valiant. Yasooka popped his [Scroll of Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+of+Avacyn) and replaced it with another. Cycling through his deck at a rapid click, Yasooka found his way to a [Riders of Gavony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riders+of+Gavony), coming down naming Humans. Pedrakowski made a [Somberwald Vigilante](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somberwald+Vigilante) on his turn, but a lack of a second [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) left him without a play. He passed the turn back, allowing Yasooka to add a [Spectral Gateguards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Gateguards) to his team, choosing not to pair them up with the Riders to avoid a redundant double vigilance.

*Pedrakowski's deck can come out of the gates swinging, despite talk that the format was slow.*

Pedrakowski was in serious trouble. He was forced to make a [Lightning Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Mauler) and pass the turn back to Yasooka. Yasooka took advantage of Pedrakowski's troubles to attack him down to 5. Yasooka added a [Farbog Explorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farbog+Explorer) to his team and passed the turn. Pedrakowski made a [Gang of Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gang+of+Devils) and passed the turn back to defend. When Yasooka attacked in with his team, Pedrakowski tossed his men in front of what he could, but Yasooka used a [Zealous Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Strike) to pump up his unblocked Explorer, dropping Pedrakowski to 1. On the following turn, Yasooka finished him off.

### Game 3


Both players once again kept their opening hands. Pedrakowski started first with a [Kruin Striker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Striker), powering it up with a [Latch Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Latch+Seeker) before attacking into Yasooka on the following turn. The Japanese player had a [Thraben Valiant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Valiant) that could block, but he chose not to, electing to save it to team up with his [Hanweir Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanweir+Lancer) on the following turn. Pedrakowski was undeterred, pushing the Lancer back to Yasooka's hand with a [Mist Raven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Raven), allowing him to attack Yasooka down to 11. Yasooka simply replayed the Lancer and passed the turn after an attack for 2.


Pedrakowski found a stroke of incredible luck in an [Elgaud Shieldmate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elgaud+Shieldmate) to give his unblockable [Latch Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Latch+Seeker) hexproof. The powerful combination looked poised to end this game before Yasooka could even really get started. Combined with the [Mist Raven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mist+Raven) that Yasooka couldn't block either, Pedrakowski was attacking for five unblockable damage each turn. Yasooka made a [Goldnight Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldnight+Commander), but it was likely to be too little too late, even with a ridiculous [Thatcher Revolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thatcher+Revolt) turn. Pedrakowski attacked him down to 1. Yasooka untapped and surveyed the board. After some brief phantom-abacus math, Yasooka conceded the final game of the match after an absurdly good draw from Pedrakowski.
