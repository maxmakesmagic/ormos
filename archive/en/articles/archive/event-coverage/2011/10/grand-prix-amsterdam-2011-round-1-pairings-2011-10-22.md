Grand Prix Amsterdam 2011 Round 1 Pairings
==========================================

Deal with what you Can
----------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

It's the final round of GP Amsterdam, but for at least some of the feature match winners it won't be the end of the road. The top 8 beckons, but ahead of our intrepid octet are three more tables. All three may well ID, leaving these four tables effectively playing for 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th place. While all of these are excellent achievements, only two are likely to be greeted with a smile. Tiebreaks you can't control. The best Magic you can play when it matters most? It's time to deal with what you can, and wait for the final standings.

Like many a satisfying deck built from scratch, a common theme works wonders. Can you spot the theme for round five feature match action? First, Marco Monetto of Italy faces the unknown Kazuya Mitamura of Japan. Then, fellow Italian Pierluigi Aceto faces newcomer Shuhei Nakamura. From Switzerland, Marcel Schuler faces feature match debutant Tomaharu Saito of Japan. And then his fellow Swiss Florian Comte has what should be an easy matchup against Yuuya Watanabe of Japan. You see the theme? That's right - Monetto, Aceto, Schuler, and Comte, all have less than twelve syllables in their names. Ah, symmetry.
