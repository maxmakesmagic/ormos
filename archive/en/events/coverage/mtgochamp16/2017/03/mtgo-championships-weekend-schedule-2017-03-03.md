 Looking for a quick overview of the *Magic Online* Championship this weekend? Here's the basics, and what you can expect.

The Basics
==========



 The *Magic Online* Championship is a three-day tournament featuring sixteen players who qualified from 2016's *Magic Online* Championship Series events and its leaderboard for that year. The prize pool is $116,000, with last place getting a minimum of $4,000 and first place getting $25,000, plus Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club for the remainder of this season and the entirety of the 2017-18 season, plus an invitation to the 2017 *Magic* World Championship.




 For more in-depth info on this event, including overviews on each of the sixteen competitors, [check out my initial article from a few weeks ago](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-championship-approaches-2017-02-07).



The Coverage
============


This event is being covered differently than we've done it in previous years. Those who are familiar with the Vintage Super League will notice some similarities, as Randy Buehler and Athena Froehlich lead the live video team, bringing in a variety of commentators remotely. Maria Batholdi will be on site as well providing live interviews between the rounds.


If you're interested in hearing commentary from a caster, you can see the full schedule below.
