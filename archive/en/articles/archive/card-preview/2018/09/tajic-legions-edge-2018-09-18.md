We are deep into *Guilds of Ravnica* preview season, and I've got a card today that may give Boros a solid edge in combat. The Boros Legion is all about beating down, and their keyword, mentor, reflects that. Let's take a look at Tajic, Legion's Edge:

There's a lot to take in here (and it's all so shiny), so let's start at the top.


Tajic is a 3/2 haste for three, which is appealing, as he can threaten planeswalkers and the opponent's life total without any warning.


Mentor on a 3-power creature fits perfectly into most aggressive curves, as the first two turns give you plenty of opportunities to play creatures with 1 or 2 power. That, plus haste, means that Tajic essentially attacks as a 4-power creature and may sometimes even get more damage through by enabling an attack from one of your creatures that otherwise would be too small to get through blockers.


The next two abilities are interesting as well. Preventing all noncombat to your other creatures is an odd one, but quite powerful. Against most burn spells, it forces the opponent to target Tajic first, but where it gets really strong is against [sweepers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/top-decks/what-expect-pro-tour-hour-devastation-2017-07-25#sweeper). With Tajic in play, casting a deal-2 to all creatures will only kill Tajic, and an effect that deals 1 to all creatures (what in the [*whirled*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chainwhirler) could that be?) has no effect at all. That could drastically change how matchups play out and makes Tajic a powerful protective force.


Lastly, you can give Tajic first strike if you've got some extra mana lying around. That means that in the mid to late game, he can attack with impunity and requires strong blockers to keep him back.


When you add all that up, you are getting quite the card for just three mana. Tajic offers a powerful offensive threat, protection from damage-based removal, and a lot of stats for just three mana, with additional benefits when you can activate the first strike ability to boot.


Thanks to [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry), Tajic may show up in a wide range of decks, from white decks splashing red, to evenly split red-white decks, to red decks splashing white. He may make friends with everyone from [Benalish Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Marshal) to [Goblin Chainwhirler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chainwhirler), and all costs in between. We don't know exactly what the entire Legion looks like, but Tajic is a great startâ€”the Boros Legion is coming, and will be heard.
