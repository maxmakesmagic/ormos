Welcome to the *Time Spiral* edition of the [Lexicon](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=lexicon), in which we explore the meanings of some of the more obscure words we use in the names of those cards. While many offbeat names in **Magic** (like “[Herd Gnarr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Herd%2BGnarr)”) are simply made up, we often dig around dictionaries for real little-used and archaic words for inspiration.
