**2017-18 Team Standings**


*Note: An italicized team member score is not included in the team's total by event. Only the Top 5 team member results are counted, with the exception of the last Pro Tour of the season.  

An asterisk (\*) next to a player's name means that the player has been substituted off the team in favor of a different player.*  
*Any Pro Tour Pro Point totals in the below standings marked with a hyphen mean that the player's Pro Points did not count for the team's score as of that Pro Tour.*
