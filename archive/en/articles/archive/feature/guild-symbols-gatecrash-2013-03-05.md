The city-plane of Ravnica is full of guilds. And it's also full of guild symbols. And from that it follows that *Gatecrash*, being set on Ravnica, has guild symbols in card art.


Sometimes, the symbol is prominent, in the fashion of the Boros [Truefire Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Truefire+Paladin).

Sometimes, they're being formed out of *pure magic*, like the Simic symbol on [Gyre Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gyre+Sage).

Sometimes they're hidden, like the Gruul graffiti on the wall next to [Wasteland Viper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland+Viper).

Sometimes it's chiseled on the wall of an Orzhov mausoleum, as on [Immortal Servitude](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immortal+Servitude).

Sometimes they're graffiti on a person! Wait, that's just a Dimir tattoo. Anyway, here's [Coerced Confession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coerced+Confession).
