Pro Tour *Theros*  will begin Friday at 9 a.m. Dublin time as scheduled. The anticipated delays connected to a partial air traffic controllers strike did not significantly affect players' ability to arrive in Dublin on time to register on Thursday.

Tune in for the [Pro Tour *Theros*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/theros13) live video stream at [wizards.com/webcast](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/events.aspx?x=mtgevent/webcast/home) and [twitch.tv/magic](/en/events/coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93amsterdam-standard-qualifier-season-top-8-decklists). Friday begins with the induction ceremony of the 2013 Pro Tour Hall of Fame class, followed by three rounds of *Theros* Booster Draft and five rounds of Standard.
