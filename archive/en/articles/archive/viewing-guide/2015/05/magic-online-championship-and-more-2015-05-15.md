This weekend has two offerings on each of our Twitchchannels, along with a little more beyond that.



First up…

The 2014 *Magic Online* Championship starts today and we're covering all three days of action! Today features three rounds of Vintage followed by four rounds of Modern. Tomorrow, the sixteen competitors will be playing three rounds of *Dragons of Tarkir* Booster Draft and four rounds of Standard before a cut to the Top 4 on Sunday.



Will the $25,000 first place prize go to one of the three former Pro Tour champions competing in this invitation-only event, or will it go to a relatively new player to the competitive *Magic* scene? This event has been a springboard for players, such as Reid Duke, and the 2014 Magic Online Championship is your chance to see a rising star—or even an old veteran reemerge onto the scene.



Join Marshall Sutcliffe, Brian David-Marshall, Eric Froehlich, and Kenji Egashira for the 2014 *Magic Online* Championship live coverage! It all starts today at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET/5 p.m. UTC on the [*Magic* Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/Magic/). Coverage resumes Saturday at the same time, and the Top 4 takes place on Sunday at 12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET/7 p.m. UTC.

The *Magic Online* Championship isn't the only official Magic event to watch this weekend. Grand Prix Florence highlights this season's Team Limited fun, a format that tends to bring out powerhouse teams, great *Magic* in action, and a few folks from outside the continent joining in the competition.



Join Matej Zatlkaj, Frank Karsten, Simon Görtzen, Steven Leeming, Tim Willoughby, and Rich Hagon as they bring you both days of live Team Limited fun on the [*Magic*2 Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2). Coverage begins both days at 10:30 a.m. local time (CET)/1:30 a.m. PT/4:30 a.m. ET/8:30 a.m. UTC.

And on Tuesday, tune in for Week Four of the Standard Super League! While Josh Utter-Leyton claimed victory last week, it's Gerry Thompson who currently leads the competitors thanks to consistent finishes over the last few weeks, with Owen Turtenwald following closely behind in the second spot. However, anything could happen as players jockey for more points this week.



Will Gerry retain his lead, or will Owen…or will one of the players following closely behind both leap to the top instead? Join hosts Randy Buehler and Luis Scott-Vargas for Week 4 of the Standard Super League on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) this Tuesday at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. UTC to find out!

Join hosts Cedric Phillips and Matthias Hunt as they bring you two days of Standard coverage on the [SCGLive Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive)! It all starts Saturday at 10:30 a.m. local time (CT)/8:30 a.m. PT/11:30 a.m. ET/3:30 p.m. UTC. Coverage resumes for Day Two on Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (CT)/7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET/2 p.m. UTC.
