As [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)s digging up [Kessig Wolf Run](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run)s continue to establish themselves in the top tier of the Standard format using a variety of different spins and twists and sometimes even [Copper Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr), Top Decks takes a step away from Standard to make its seldom stopover to the (Eternal) Undying Lands, with a nod to Grand Prix Amsterdam and the Legacy format.

One of the cool things to come out of this tournament is that we can see the presence of some new cards (always great) but also some changes to the format as a hole.

This is what the Amsterdam Legacy Grand Prix Top 8 looked like:
