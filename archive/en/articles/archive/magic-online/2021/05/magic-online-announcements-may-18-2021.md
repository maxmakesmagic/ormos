*Legacy Cube* May 12–26
-----------------------


For two weeks, we're reviving a cube that's been dormant for almost a full year. For those of you who love the power level of *Vintage Cube* without the huge spikes that come with actual power, *Legacy Cube* is the cube for you!

Classes are now in session, with guest-lecture alternative play events available weekly. Each of these events begins on Wednesday at 10 a.m. Pacific time and continues for one week unless otherwise specified. The *Strixhaven* season ends with the MTGO launch of *Modern Horizons 2* in early June.


* May 26: New to the Spotlight Cube Series – As usual for new spotlight cubes, we'll have more information as we get closer.

Showcase Challenge Weekends
---------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Set Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, May 22, we have the Modern Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT, and on Sunday, May 23, we have the Pioneer Showcase Challenge at 6 a.m. PT. Then next week on Saturday, May 29, we have the Vintage Showcase Challenge at 10 a.m. PT, and on Sunday, May 30, we finish things off with the Legacy Showcase Challenge at 8 a.m. PT. Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in August.
