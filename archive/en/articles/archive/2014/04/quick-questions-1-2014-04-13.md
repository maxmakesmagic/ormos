**Which of the *Journey to Nyx* cards that have been previewed thus far are you the most excited about?** 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/yasooka.jpg)***Shouta Yasooka**: I don’t know about Standard, but I’m excited to look at Ajani, Mentor of Heroes, for the Pro Tour.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/kuo.jpg)***Tzu-Ching Kuo**: Silence the Believers and Mana Confluence.* 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/lee.jpg)***Shi Tian Lee**: Setassan Tactics. In Limited, especially, it is not even close to a fair **Magic** card. I'm also looking forward to Ajani, but mostly because I want a chance to [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) when someone tries to ultimate it. [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack), effectively dealing 103 damage!* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/yukuhiro.jpg)***Ken Yukuhiro**: Dictate of Kruphix. [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) and cards like that have always let opponents draw first, but now you can play that effect and not have to give up the first card. I'll probably try to work with Dictate first when I'm testing for the Pro Tour. Other than that, Ajani is a good card. Both abilities add loyalty, and Planeswalkers like that aren't easy to kill. They build up too much loyalty, which lets you stabilize with them. Besides, Ajani can always find himself with his second ability, and you might get to gain 100 life!* 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/watanabe.jpg)***Yuuya Watanabe**: Eidolon of the Great Revel. I'm interested in looking at an aggressive red deck for the next Pro Tour. *Journey into Nyx* has a bunch of good cheap creatures, like Mogis's Warhound and Gnarled Scarhide. Block Constructed is going to have a bunch of inexpensive cards in it, so Eidolon should be good. Ajani is also nice.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpnag14/sim.jpg)***Chapman Sim**: Keranos, God of Storms. No matter what you draw on your turn, Keranos is going to do something. The only risk you really run is dying when you tap out to play it.*
