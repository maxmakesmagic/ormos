Spotlight Cube Series: *MenguCube*
----------------------------------


Our last addition to the Spotlight Cube Series for *Kaldheim* season, *MenguCube* is Andrea Mengucci's take on MTGO's regular *Vintage Cube*, but with more of the archetypes and colors that Andrea and his friends from Senigallia, Italy, enjoy most: blue spells and artifacts. *MenguCube* runs from April 7–14.


For a full list cards and an explanation of archetypes, check out [Andrea's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-mengucube-2021-04-06).

Spotlight Cube Series: *Nega-Cube*
----------------------------------


Natalie Weizenbaum's *Nega-Cube* will be available on *Magic Online* one more day before ending the morning of April 7. *Nega-Cube* features cards that aren't a part of the major MTGO cubes (Vintage, Legacy, and Modern).


For a full list cards and an explanation of archetypes, check out [Natalie's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-nega-cube-2021-03-30).

April 25 Qualifier Update
-------------------------


The Sealed Qualifier event for April 25 at 2 p.m. on MTGO has been changed from a *Strixhaven: School of Mages* Sealed Qualifier to a *Time Spiral Remastered* Sealed Qualifier. This change does not affect the *Strixhaven: School of Mages* Sealed Showcase Qualifier event earlier that same day.


You can view this update on the [MTGO Premier Play page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2021) and [MTGO event schedule](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/schedule-magic-online-products-game-info).

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Split Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, April 10, we have the Standard (6 a.m. PT), Modern (8 a.m. PT), and Vintage (10 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Then on Sunday, April 11, we finish off with the Pioneer (6 a.m. PT), Legacy (8 a.m. PT), and *Kaldheim* Sealed (9 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in April.


Learn more about Showcase Challenge events [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2021#schallenges).

All-Access Weeks, Starring Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------------------


All-Access Weeks are back! From now through April 14, the Mythic Event Token is available in the *Magic Online* store. With it, you can play with almost every card in *Magic Online*.


To use the Mythic Event Token, simply purchase it in the *Magic Online* store and enter a game or event. No cards will be added to your collection, but you'll be able to play with a deck even if you don't have all the cards in your collection.


The token is $25, and the access will last until downtime on April 14. (We'll remove all the Mythic Event Tokens from accounts then.)


And what better way to use that access than to play in Super Qualifiers? Every day from April 3 through April 9, there will be a Super Qualifier available to play in! We're upgrading the previously announced Pauper and Vintage Qualifiers and adding five more to play in. Whatever your format, we've got a Super Qualifier for you!


Each of these events will let you enter with two Mythic Event Tokens. That means that if you want to play in a Super Qualifier and have already gotten a Mythic Token, you can save on entry by picking up a second token instead of the normal entry options! And don't worry; spending your Mythic Event Tokens won't end your access early.





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **EVENT/FORMAT** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tuesday, April 6, 2021 | 3:00 p.m. | Pioneer Super Qualifier |
| Wednesday, April 7, 2021 | 12:00 p.m. (noon) | Standard Super Qualifier |
| Thursday, April 8, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | Legacy Super Qualifier |
| Friday, April 9, 2021 | 2:00 p.m. | Modern Super Qualifier |


All times listed in Pacific time (UTC-7).
