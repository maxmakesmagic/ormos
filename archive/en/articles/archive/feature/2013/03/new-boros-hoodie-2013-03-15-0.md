The Boros Legion captured my heart right away when we first came to Ravnica, and ever since then I have been a loyal soldier for the red and white.


There is a new item up for sale on [MTGMerch.com](http://www.mtgmerch.com), and it is of course one I am very excited about! A new hoodie for what is clearly the best guild out there: Boros!
