 Mike Cannon started writing From the Lab at the end of 2012 after two years with GatheringMagic. He is an ardent casual player and loves finding uses for bad cards. 







Hello Labbies! With only a few days left until *Conspiracy* is released, I thought I'd take another look through all the awesome new cards in the set. *Conspiracy* has a lot of cards we would never see in a normal set, and some of them present great opportunities for new combo decks. 


### Bigger and Better


The first card that caught my eye was [Muzzio, Visionary Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muzzio%2C+Visionary+Architect). Any card that can put things onto the battlefield for free has potential, and this ability seemed particularly interesting to build around.


![Muzzio, Visionary Architect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Muzzio%2C+Visionary+Architect)
  
 Muzzio requires two things to really work well. You'll want some sweet artifacts to cheat into play, and some way to make sure you find them when you activate the ability. You could use a card like [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to make sure you hit what you want, but I wanted to go a different route. I wanted to actually look at a giant chunk of cards. 


 To do that, we'll need some artifacts with high converted mana costs that can be cast for much less. I started out looking at [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco). With the highest converted mana cost of any card in the game, it can dig through more than a quarter of your library. It also costs ten mana less to cast if you have a land of each type. 


 The only problem was that ten mana less is still six mana, which is more than I wanted to pay for an enabler. Therefore, I turned to another way to may my artifacts cost less: affinity. [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) has a high converted mana cost of seven, but with enough artifacts on the board, it can be easily cast for three or four mana. 


![Myr Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Myr+Enforcer)
  
 Another card perfect for the deck was [Mycosynth Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycosynth+Golem). Not only does it have a converted mana cost of eleven, it gives all your other artifact creatures affinity. That could let you just cast whatever giant creature you want at a huge discount. If you don't have a finisher in hand, Muzzio can look at the top eleven cards of your library and put one straight onto the battlefield for you. In addition, multiple instances of affinity for artifacts are cumulative, so any other [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer)s and [Mycosynth Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycosynth+Golem)s will cost two less for each artifact you control. 


 When it comes to giant artifact creatures to cheat into play, it doesn't get better than [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus). With the potential to kill an opponent in one attack and an immunity to most removal spells, it will almost always win you the game when put out this far ahead of schedule. As a backup, its uninfected brother [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) is no slouch either, although it does take two attacks to end the game.

To get the requisite number of artifacts to make affinity effective, I turned to some old staples of artifacts decks in different eras.



[Mox Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) and [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) each make one mana each turn for free, provided you can meet their conditions. Since that mana can be of any color, they also help you get the blue you need to cast [Muzzio, Visionary Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muzzio%2C+Visionary+Architect). [Izzet Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet) and [Azorius Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Signet) serve a similar purpose. Although they appear to cost two mana, if you can use them immediately the net cost is only one.

[Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) joins its affinity brethren as a potentially free artifact that can come down early in the game, and [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) serves as a one-mana [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) most of the time. Powering these affinity spells are a number of artifact lands, including [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod), [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace), [Ancient Den](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Den), and [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel). When casting spells with affinity, they effectively produce two mana, which is why they have been banned in a number of formats over the years.

### Let's be Treasonable


Another card that I wanted to experiment with was [Treasonous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasonous+Ogre). Although 3 life for one mana is a lot, anything that allows you to get free mana can be broken. Unfortunately, even if you can prevent yourself from losing the game you can't pay more life than you have, so you can only activate the ability six times.


Or can you?


![Treasonous Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Treasonous+Ogre)
  
If you can gain life somehow, then you can make even more mana. Here's what I came up with.


 First, you use [Sunspring Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunspring+Expedition) or [Rest for the Weary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+for+the+Weary) to gain 8 life. Now you can activate the Ogre's ability nine times. Then sacrifice [Children of Korlis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Children+of+Korlis) or [Tainted Sigil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Sigil) to get all your life back, allowing you to get another nine mana. Add in some mana from other sources and you can cast an X spell to deal 20 damage to your opponent. 


 For the X spells, I chose [Comet Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Comet+Storm) and [Aurelia's Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurelia%27s+Fury). Both are instants, which will become relevant later, and the one extra mana isn't too taxing. 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Tainted Sigil | Aurelia's Fury |

 Normally you'll need to get five mana from lands or other sources, but if you have a [Tainted Sigil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Sigil) and two X spells you can reduce that a bit. Activate [Treasonous Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasonous+Ogre) nine times, then add in three of your own mana to deal 10 damage to your opponent. [Tainted Sigil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Sigil) will give you back all your life plus 10, and you can activate the Ogre twelve times to deal the other 10 damage. 



[Braid of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braid+of+Fire) can give you an assist on the mana production, so long as you can use the mana before it empties from your pool at the end of your upkeep. This is why it's worth paying the extra mana for [Comet Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Comet+Storm) and [Aurelia's Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurelia%27s+Fury) instead of something like [Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze) or [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball). [Braid of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braid+of+Fire) can give you back far more than that if it stays on the battlefield for a few turns. 




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Braid of Fire | Comet Storm |

 Unneeded X spells can be used as spot removal, but I wanted a way to clear the board and keep your life total high enough to pull off the combo. To that end, I added in [Blasphemous Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act), which should annihilate just about any creature you run into. Although the mana cost seems high, in the situations you want to cast it, it will most often cost around half as much.

### The Drafting Table


 There are a variety of cool interactions you can put together in *Conspiracy*, and some of them can happen before the game even starts. The set includes a number of cards that have effects during the draft, and some of them can be combined to great effect. Here are a few examples of some of the coolest things you can pull off during the course of a *Conspiracy* draft. 



**Æther Searcher**



![Ã†ther Searcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%C3%86ther+Searcher)
  
If you manage to draft two of these in a row, start taking every one you see. When you cast one in a game, you can search for another copy of [Æther Searcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Searcher), which can search for another copy, and so on. You'll have an instant army for seven mana. Note that the card searches your hand and library, so you can also take an off-color bomb afterward and use the robot to cast it even if it's in your hand.



**Agent of Acquisitions/Lore Seeker**





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Agent of Acquisitions | Lore Seeker |

 If you've already drafted [Agent of Acquisitions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Acquisitions), you might want to keep an eye out for [Lore Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lore+Seeker). When you draft that, you can add a booster pack of any set to the draft. If you like what you see, you can use [Agent of Acquisitions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Acquisitions) to keep the entire pack to yourself. 


 A pack of *Mirrodin* or *Darksteel* could give you access to powerful common and uncommon Equipment cards such as [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter), [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear), [Vulshok Morningstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Morningstar), [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer), and [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). You could also luck out and get a [Sword of Fire and Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice) or [Sword of Light and Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Light+and+Shadow). If you've picked up a copy of Worldknit or think you can grab one later, a pack of *Alara Reborn* will give you a whole pile of powerful multicolored cards. Since *Conspiracy* games are multiplayer, you could also use *Rise of the Eldrazi* to pick up a suite of giant creatures that will help you win the longer games. 



**Lurking Automaton**



![Lurking Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lurking+Automaton)
  
If you grab several copies of this early, you can then ignore any other copies you see throughout the draft. Unless your opponents waste their early picks taking other Automatons to make sure yours aren't good, you'll be left with a bunch of massive five-mana creatures. Most players won't want to use an early pick on what might just be a five-mana 4/4, so whenever one of the Automatons sticks around until later in the pack, you'll have several of them to take advantage of.


You can go even further by taking the conspiracy Secret Summoning. If you name [Lurking Automaton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Automaton) before the game starts, you can start chaining together a string of enormous creatures as soon as you hit five mana. You can also use Brago's Favor to reduce the cost even further, making your giant robots cost four or even three mana.


**Double Stroke**


![Double Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Double+Stroke)
  
 This conspiracy is pretty good no matter what instant or sorcery you name, but there are a couple that are particularly effective. If you name [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip), you can target a large creature with the original, and a 1-toughness creature with the copy. The copy will kill the small creature, activating morbid and making the original give its target -13/-13. 


[Æther Tradewinds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds) is also more effective when copied. You can target the same permanent you control with both copies, but choose different permanents your opponent control. The copy will return your permanent to hand, and since the original still has one of its two targets, it will resolve and return the other opposing permanent with no downside.



**Muzzio's Preparations**



![Muzzio's Preparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Muzzio%27s+Preparations)
  
 If you name a card like [Howling Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Wolf) or [Screaming Seahawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screaming+Seahawk) with this card, you can be sure to take advantage of that extra +1/+1 counter multiple times. You can also use it in combination with Secret Summoning to make a creature like [Courier Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier+Hawk) into a much beefier version of [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). 


 You can also use Brago's Favor to great effect with creatures that search for each other. [Screaming Seahawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screaming+Seahawk) and [Howling Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Wolf) both cost a couple extra mana in exchange for having the search ability, but Brago's Favor can fix that quite nicely. 


### The Game is Afoot


 The Vorthos deck-building contest is still going on, so make sure to get your submissions in by next week. If you missed [last week's article](/en/articles/archive/lab/not-my-type-2014-05-28), all you have to do is build a deck around some part of **Magic**'s storyline and send it in, along with a description of the cards chosen. In two weeks, I'll highlight a few of my favorites here. So get cracking, and until then, may all your conspiracies remain undetected until it's too late. See ya!
