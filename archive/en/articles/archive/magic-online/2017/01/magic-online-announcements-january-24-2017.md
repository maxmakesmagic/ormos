General | Corrected all links in the EULA to direct to the proper pages.


General | New Product Window settings will now be remembered more consistently.


General | Updated copywrite year in legal text.


General | Added the *Kaladesh* prestige avatars to qualifying accounts, which you can read about [in this article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-event-updates-november-2016-11-09#avatar).


General | Fixed an issue causing Unhinged land art to appear distorted.

Duel Scene | Fixed an error that was preventing players from tapping newly played lands.


Commander | [Thelon of Havenwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thelon+of+Havenwood) is providing bonuses to Thallids with spore counters correctly.


Commander | Added a commander damage display. [Learn more in Alli Medwin’s article.](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/aetheror-2017-01-18)


Modern | Fixed an error that would sometimes cause [Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold)'s tokens to enter the battlefield but not be attacking.


Modern | Fixed the error causing [Saffi Eriksdotter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saffi+Eriksdotter)'s delayed trigger to have no effect.


Modern | Discarding [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) to the ability of [Insolent Neonate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insolent+Neonate) now correctly creates a zombie token.


Modern | [Porphyry Nodes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porphyry+Nodes) no longer causes a soft-lock when there are two creatures tied for the lowest power and the controller has selected to Always Yield to the triggered effect.


Modern | [Revenge of the Hunted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revenge+of+the+Hunted) now correctly forces all of the opponent's creatures to block the targeted creature.


Modern| Fixed an issue that caused [Rite of Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Ruin) to occasionally sacrifice the wrong number of lands.


Standard | Players can now view the top seven cards of their library when playing [Deploy the Gatewatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deploy+the+Gatewatch), even if there are no planeswalkers in those cards.


Standard | Hitting CTRL+Z after selecting lands for [Fork in the Road](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork+in+the+Road) no longer has any effect.


 


NOTE: Tomorrow’s update will introduce a bug that affects resolving the abilities for Narset Transcendent, Domri Rade, and Scrying Sheets that reveal cards from the top of your library. [Full details on how to work around this issue can be found on the MTGO Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/156320779929/bug-warning). We expect to have a fix out before the weekend.
