Pro Tour–San Diego has come and gone. Which, when you think about it, is what happens to most things. But our coverage is still [right here](/en/events/coverage/g%C3%B6rtzen-goes-all-way-san-diego) with the whole story.

During the event, we also covered it via Twitter on @[magicprotour](http://www.twitter.com/magicprotour), but for the moment we want to talk about other people's tweets. The hashtag #ptsandiego let people post their own thoughts, observations, and one-liners. And here are some of the ones we particularly liked!

**@[herodotusjr](http://www.twitter.com/herodotusjr)**: The hashtag for the Pro Tour this weekend makes me want to burst into song. "Where in the World is #ptsandiego" It even scans right!
