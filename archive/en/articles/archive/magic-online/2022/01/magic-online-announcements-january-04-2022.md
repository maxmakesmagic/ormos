*Vintage Cube* Is Back: December 22–January 12
----------------------------------------------


*Vintage Cube* is back for a three-week run through January 12. To see the full cube list and the list of card changes, make sure to check out [the updated Vintage Cube card list page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).


All paid accounts on file as of last week's downtime have been given a Vintage Point—good for a free entry into the *Vintage Cube* Draft League during this three-week run.


**This is the last week to use your Vintage Point if you haven't yet done so!** *Unused Vintage Points will be removed from accounts on January 12.*

Limited Showcase Opens This Weekend
-----------------------------------


The penultimate events of each season, Showcase Opens allow anyone to try their hand at earning an invitation to the Showcase. Players don't need to earn points or another qualification to enter, and because these events are Sealed, players don't even need a deck. The winner of each Open will get an invitation to the Season 3 Showcase, and both the winner and runner-up earn invitations to the upcoming Championship on *MTG Arena*.


Because this event uses *Modern Horizons 2* product, the entry options are 50 Event Tickets or 500 Play Points. Each Open consists of Swiss rounds followed by a single-elimination Top 8 draft.


These events are also the last chance to earn enough [Leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) points to grab one of two At-Large invites to the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase.


Showcase Opens are scheduled as follows:





| DATE | TIME | UTC | FORMAT | INVITATION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saturday, January 8, 2022 | 7:00 a.m. | 15:00 | MH2 Sealed | MOCS Showcase & Neon Dynasty Championship (*MTG Arena*) |
| Sunday, January 9, 2022 | 7:00 a.m. | 15:00 | MH2 Sealed | MOCS Showcase & Neon Dynasty Championship (*MTG Arena*) |


Learn more about Showcase Open events [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2021#so).

Limited Qualifier Friday
------------------------


On Friday, January 7, there will be a *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* Sealed Qualifier with a special start time of 2 p.m. PT (22:00 UTC). The event costs 40 QPs (Season 1), and the winner will earn an invitation to the Neon Dynasty Championship event on *MTG Arena*.
