When[Soldevi Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldevi+Sage) from *Alliances* was reprinted in *Sixth Edition*, one of the two alternate pieces of *Alliances* art had to be chosen for the reprint. The seated woman was chosen for the *Sixth Edition* printing.

However, the art was actually printed reversed left-to-right. In the *Sixth Edition* version, the reversal was corrected.

How can you tell that the art was backwards? As you can see in the high-resolution art, the artist, Carol Heyer, inscribed her last name on the binder of the book that the Sage is reading. In the Alliances version, her name was backwards!
