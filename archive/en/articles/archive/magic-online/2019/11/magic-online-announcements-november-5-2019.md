Pioneering a New Ban Cadence
----------------------------


For the new Pioneer format, R&D has announced that all changes to the banned list will happen on Mondays. Since we know that many Pioneer fans play on *Magic Online*, we wanted to make it clear how this will work with *Magic Online* league play.


Until the Pioneer format is placed on the normal ban cadence, Pioneer bans will take effect the day after the announcement, at noon Pacific time on Tuesdays.


If a card is banned, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses up until the ban takes effect. At noon PT on Tuesday, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned, players will be able to join the Pioneer league with decks containing those cards after the changes are made effective at noon PT on Tuesday.

Pioneer on *Magic Online*
-------------------------


Pioneer, *Magic*'s new nonrotating format featuring cards from *Return to Ravnica* forward, has arrived on *Magic Online*. Pioneer Leagues and Format Challenges are well underway, so now's the time to build something new!


For more information about Pioneer, check out [Blake's announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-pioneer-format-2019-10-21).

*Masters Edition III* Encore Draft
----------------------------------


Beginning tomorrow, November 6, and running until next Wednesday, November 13, you can draft *Masters Edition III*. And just like the *Masters Edition* draft two weeks earlier, it's using the original Draft style: this is non-Phantom. When you draft these cards, they're added to your collection. Entry options are 12 Event Tickets, 3 *Masters Edition III* boosters plus 2 Event Tickets, or 120 Play Points.


For weeks listed in the [Alternative Play Calendar from Alli's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo/throne-eldraine-magic-online-edition-2019-09-18#altplay) as non-Phantom events, this League will begin at approximately 10 a.m. PT on the first day listed, which is always a Wednesday. These Leagues will be closed to new entries at 10 a.m. PT on the last day listed and ended no later than 2 p.m. that same day.

Alternative Play Calendar
-------------------------


For the *Throne of Eldraine* Alternative Play season, we're trying something new and different: a series of blasts from the past. And by that, we mean way in the past. For this season, we're introducing several non-Phantom events into the schedule, but all events listed below are Phantom unless stated otherwise:





| Events | Dates | Phantom or non-Phantom |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Masters Edition III* Encore Draft | November 6–13 | non-Phantom |
| *Legacy Cube* | November 13–20 | Phantom |
| *Masters Edition IV* Encore Draft | November 20–27 | non-Phantom |
| *Modern Horizons* Encore Draft | November 27–December 4 | Phantom & non-Phantom |
| *Vintage Masters* Encore Draft | December 4–11 | non-Phantom |
| *Vintage Cube* | December 11–TBD | Phantom |
