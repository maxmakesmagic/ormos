From time to time, a sketch comes in that's so *right* that there's no point elaborating on it. So let's take a look at Dan Scott's [Kor Skyfisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Skyfisher)!


The card, as you may already know, looks like this:



![Kor Skyfisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kor+Skyfisher)

The art description was this:



> Color: White creature  
> 
> Location: Plains environment  
> 
> Action: Show a female kor warrior who's riding a kitesail, a flying device of your design, through the sky. As she flies, she trails a long rope with a large hook (see style guide pg. 47-48 for kor hook designs). She's "fishing" for flying creatures or other valuables by air.  
> 
> Focus: The kor sky-scout  
> 
> Mood: She's on the look-out for any goodies -- and if she finds it, watch out.


And now here's the final art. Click it to see the original sketch. Then click it again to change it back. Whee!
