Since Beta.


S: How long have you been playing competitively?


Mirage Block.

Won Prereleases, second at Prereleases.

Replenish. Understand it very well - familiar with cards.


S: How does it stack up against the field?


Good matchups, about the third best behind Angry Hermit and Flores Black.


S: How do you feel about your chances in the Top 8? 


Depends on how many Angry Hermit decks I have to face - the less the better.

Candleabra of Tawnos (it was my first card), Brainstorm and Ancestral Recall.

Pitch cards - especially from Alliances.


S: What's your favorite movie?


Braveheart. Very heroic. "I'm not a sissy or nothing, but Braveheart touched something deep inside of me."
