Venser, for those who've been following the *Time Spiral* Block novel storyline, entered our story as a promising young artificer from gloomy, apocalypse-blasted Urborg. [Venser's Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%27s+Sliver), a card from *Time Spiral,* shows off his artifact-construction talents.

Smart and resourceful, Venser found himself a place traveling alongside the former planeswalker Teferi and the ageless artificer Jhoira. Gradually, Venser came into his own not only as an artificer, but as a master of teleportation magic. Today's feature article by Rei Nakazawa showcases a new *Future Sight* look at this up-and-coming mage, now a powerful card in his own right. 


Aleksi Briclot was tasked with Venser's illustration.

Although this sketch does have the proper look for a blue-aligned wizard in *Time Spiral* Block, the creative team wanted to see more personality for this central character, and more of a sense of Venser's teleportation powers. Venser has the power to appear out of nowhere, warp through rifts in space, and pull other people and objects through the planar mist along with him—he should look formidable!

Now you can see a lot more of Venser's spirit—and raw power—coming through. 


Another *Future Sight* card, illustrated by Hideaki Takamura, is also tied to Venser. You'll have to see how at the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases). Keep an eye on **magicthegathering.com** to see Venser's story develop.
