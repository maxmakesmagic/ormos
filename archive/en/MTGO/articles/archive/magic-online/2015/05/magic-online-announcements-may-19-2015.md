**Known Issue Around Trading *Tempest Remastered* Cards**


We added a new known issue in the April 23 [Bug Blog](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-bug-blog-april-23-2015) involving trading cards from *Tempest Remastered*.


The *Tempest Remastered* set is hidden if unowned. This means that if a player owns no *Tempest Remastered* cards, the *Tempest Remastered* filter cannot be selected as a possible format, even if the player has the quantity filter set to 0. Because of this issue, a player who doesn't own any *Tempest Remastered* cards cannot place any of those cards in their wishlist. This bug is scheduled to be fixed during the Wednesday, May 27 deployment. In the meantime, players can find a breakdown of how we expect this to affect trading *Tempest Remastered*. Thank you for your patience while we work on this!


**Trading *Tempest Remastered* without using wishlists:**


If a player who does not own any *Tempest Remastered* cards begins a trade with another player who has *Tempest Remastered* cards, then *Tempest Remastered* cards will be visible in the trade for both players.



* The player who did not own any *Tempest Remastered* cards is able to trade with that other player to get *Tempest Remastered* cards without issue.
* Once the trade is complete, the player who did not have any *Tempest Remastered* cards will now find that the *Tempest Remastered* filter in their collection is functional.
* Once the filter is functional, the player will only be able to see cards that they own.


**Trading *Tempest Remastered* using a wishlist:**


If a user owns no *Tempest Remastered*, the *Tempest Remastered* filter cannot be selected as a possible format, even if the player has the quantity filter set to 0. Because of this, a player who doesn't own any *Tempest Remastered* cards cannot place any of those cards in their wishlist. The only cards that can be added to the wishlist, are ones that a player already owns.
