The Mirrans and Phyrexians are at war! Where do your sympathies lie? Where do you stand?

To help you decide, the two factions have created helpful recruitment videos. These videos are conveniently located on the official Facebook pages for the Mirrans and Phyrexians.

The Mirrans lay their plans [here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mirrodin-Faction/111175072274346), while the Phyrexians plan their assault [here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phyrexian-Faction/144426112262398). Watch the videos and then decide where you stand!
