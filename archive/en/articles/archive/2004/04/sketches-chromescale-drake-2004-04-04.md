Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:). This week we take a look behind the scenes at the art of *Darksteel's*  **[Chromescale Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromescale+Drake)** by Ben Thompson. This is a *Mirrodin* block twist on the classic **Magic** drake -- as its name implies, it takes on a chromed, silvery look to fit with the artifact-world of Mirrodin.


### 1. Art Description


The art description establishes the parameters of the artist's task. It provides details of what the card will do, what its flavor role is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Mr. Thompson for the project:



> 
> *"A metallized drake with chrome-like eyes, in flight."*
> 
> 
> 


A simple description, but a fun opportunity to illustrate a big, powerful flyer. You'll recognize Ben Thompson's work from cards like [Dust Bowl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Bowl), [Llanowar Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Dead), [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), [Mistform Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Sliver), [Surestrike Trident](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surestrike+Trident) and [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge).
