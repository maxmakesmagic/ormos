*Magic Online*'s second Standard League is coming to a close, and we now have access to the 5-0 decklists. One of the more fun-looking decks I found while going through results was a Black-Green Aristocrats deck that wins by attacking with a gigantic unblockable [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk). You can do this by sacrificing your creatures for value and then using [Rogue's Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue%27s+Passage) to make [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) impossible to block.

The great thing about this deck is that most creatures in it are secretly two creatures. We have [Blisterpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blisterpod), [Carrier Thrall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrier+Thrall), and [Sultai Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Emissary), which create tokens or manifests when they die. These extra creatures do some pretty cool things, such as pump your [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) an extra time, draw you more cards with [Grim Haruspex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Haruspex), or make your [Bone Splinters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Splinters) and [Merciless Executioner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner) have very little downside.


Another cool thing about this deck is that you don't even need to attack to win. [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) does a great job of draining life from your opponent, and when you have multiples of those in play, they scale pretty nicely. When you combine them with cards such as [Blisterpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blisterpod) and [Carrier Thrall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrier+Thrall), you can get double triggers provided you have a sacrifice outlet.


[Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter) is the glue that holds this deck together. It allows you to sift through your deck to find the pieces you need. Eldrazi Scions can be sacrificed for mana and a scry, but with a Husk in play you can scry as many times as you want as long as you have the creatures to sacrifice. Drawing either a [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) or a [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) is crucial for this deck, so having a way to find them is really important.


It can be really hard to get into *Magic Online*, especially for newer players who don't have a Standard collection. This deck contains mostly commons and uncommons, which makes it very easy to build. It's a strong deck, and the 5-0 record speaks for itself. Congratulations to bigcat24 on the finish!
