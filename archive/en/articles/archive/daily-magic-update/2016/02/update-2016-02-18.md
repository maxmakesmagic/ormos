The February 18, 2016 Update
============================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**
 on February 18, 2016

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 18, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [absurdly (and awesomely) long deck names](#decknames).


Today's Must
============


1. [Are Pro Teams Ruining *Magic*?](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/stevehorton-021816-are-pro-teams-ruining-magic/) | Gathering Magic | Steve Horton

Well, now that we're through [the latest thing ruining *Magic*](#ruiningmagic), it's time to dig up another one. I'll admit, this wasn't the topic I thought the article was going to cover when I read the title, but Horton asks the interesting question of whether the way pro teams solve formats is a problem for *Magic*. Does the concentrated solving of a Pro Tour format ruin it for everyone else?


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Modern Metagame and Eldrazi Checkup](http://modernnexus.com/modern-metagame-and-eldrazi-checkup/) | Modern Nexus | Sheridan Lardner

Do Eldrazi get checkups? Can you imagine Ulamog with a tongue depressor saying "ahhh"? Or am I misreading this?


Something, something, Eldrazi all over Modern. Just how all over Modern? Well, that's what this checkup article is for. I can't do all your reading for you.


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* Spoilers: Mindwrack Demon, Tooth Collector, Eerie Interlude, and more—MTG!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHdPdxMD4ig) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Lost in all of the *Eternal Masters* hoopla? We previewed a few *Shadows over Innistrad* cards worth talking about. At least Wedge things so, and that guy has his own YouTube channel, so I'd be inclined to believe him.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHdPdxMD4ig>


1. [Modern Flashback Series: *Champions of Kamigawa* Colors](http://puremtgo.com/articles/modern-flashback-series-champions-kamigawa-colors) | PureMTGO | Vincent Borchardt

Modern Flashbacks are back, which means Vincent Borchardt is back to take us on a tour of the format *de*, um, whatever "week" is in French. Vincent has some great advice for the format which, despite *Champions*' poor reputation in Constructed, was actually a pretty sweet Draft format. I mean, Splice.dec became an archetype in *Modern Masters*, and everyone loved that format. Just remember: if you can't get [Glacial Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), get [Kabuto Moth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth).


Ahem, I mean, I'll let Vincent tell you what's what.


Oh, but if that's not enough, the Limited Resources subreddit also crowd sources a primer for every new format, and [they've done it again for triple *Champions of Kamigawa*](https://www.reddit.com/r/lrcast/comments/46dkhh/triple_champions_of_kamigawa_primer/).


1. [*Magic Duels* Developer Insights: Surge and Colorless Mana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UjprPG9yg0) | Wizards of the something, I don't know who these people are

Did you know one of our developers, Drew Nolosco, and one of our community managers, Chris Peeler, stop by the internet now and then to talk about *Magic Duels* development and issues? If you're into *Duels* or enjoy bald men with facial hair, well, the video is right here. What are you waiting for?


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UjprPG9yg0>



1. [Against the Odds: General Tazri's Five-Color Ally Creature Land Combo Family Band Solution](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-general-tazri-s-five-color-ally-creatureland-combo-family-band-solution) | MTGGoldfish | Saffron Olive

Selected mainly for the article title, the Against the Odds series is nonetheless quickly becoming one of my favorite recurring series in *Magic* content. Saffron challenges himself—or the community challenges him—to build something based around a card, and he—well he tries. Sometimes the card just isn't good enough. Sometimes it is, but things get a little weird. But it's always fun and always enjoyable to watch. So you should do that.



1. [MTG—Tolarian Winds: "Event Decks and Clash Packs Discontinued" A *Magic: The Gathering* Vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm8qHJ3ZhGk) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

We did, in fact, discontinue those two products. The Professor has some suggestions for what should replace them.

Amen.


Okay, so you might have seen a few tweets to this effect. What are people hoping we can return from? Well, as you might have noticed, we put out a statement a few days ago about [some rumors](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/statement-about-eternal-masters-card-list-2016-02-16) swirling around the community. I'm not here to add anything to that statement or to talk about an investigation that's being handled by top people (Top People!).


But I will say I'm all for returning to normal. If you're for some reason interested in ~~banging your head against a desk~~ learning more about all of the hoopla these last few days, there's plenty on the [*Magic* subreddit to browse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/) Otherwise, I vote we all move on to things that are fun and awesome.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Magic: The Parenting](http://shoutengine.com/MagictheParenting/episode-one-the-adventure-begins-16209)

I teased this podcast yesterday, but, well, now they're a real thing! If you're a parent and a *Magic* player, or a prospective parent and *Magic* player or, I suppose, a parent and prospective *Magic* player (did I get them all?), this podcast might just be for you.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [(Land)falling on Standard's head](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-constructed-league-2016-02-17)

Did I pick this deck because it was piloted by a user named JohnnyHotSauce? Maybe. Maybe not. But it's undeniably brutal either way. JohnnyHotSauce (I might use this name every time) clearly knows about aggression, and this deck has nine one-drops, seven two-drops (eleven if you count [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector), which you actually might a significant portion of the time in this deck), and a curve that stops at two ([Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) never costs more than that in real life).


Yet with 24 lands, JohnnyHotSauce has found ways to keep the land flowing (half of the lands are fetch lands) while also using it productively ([Abbot of Keral Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbot+of+Keral+Keep) and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) provide mana sinks while the landfall creatures use the lands to pump). Throw in the [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense)/[Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage) combo and you have an excitingly explosive deck.


An excitingly explosive deck by JohnnyHotSauce.
