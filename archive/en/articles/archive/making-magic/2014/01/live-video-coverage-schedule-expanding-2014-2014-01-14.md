After starting his career covering college football and basketball for ESPN.com, Greg Collins found a way to merge his love of sports and games into one job. He's been in charge of Magic event coverage since 2004. 







So you wanna watch some **Magic**? How do forty-three events across thirty-four weekends in 2014 grab you? 


 Over the next twelve months, you'll be able to watch your favorite **Magic** players battle it out for fame, glory, big prizes, and the most elusive invitations in all of **Magic**—seats at the twenty-four-person **Magic** World Championship. All of this action will unfold before your viewing eyes at [Twitch.tv/magic](/en/events/coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93amsterdam-standard-qualifier-season-top-8-decklists) and our coverage partners' channels. 


Because of the sheer frequency of events, Grand Prix form the foundation of this video schedule. We're excited to announce that there will be live video coverage at all North American, European, and Japanese Grand Prix in 2014, plus the debut of live video coverage in Australia at Grand Prix Melbourne!


 The streaming schedule also includes the four Pro Tours, World **Magic** Cup, World Championship, **Magic Online** Championship, and the Super Sunday Series. Other events may be added to that schedule as they are announced. You can see a complete schedule of events with live video coverage at the end of this article. 


 It takes an ever-growing staff to cover this many events in so many different regions. Pro Tour Hall of Famer Randy Buehler returned to the coverage booth at [Grand Prix Albuquerque](/en/events/coverage/owen-runs-it-back) last year and will be seen regularly in Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage in 2014. Last year also saw the expansion of Hall of Famer Frank Karsten's role on the European coverage team for both video and text coverage, and the addition of Hall of Famers Raphaël Lévy to the video team and Olle Råde to the writing team. 


The Hall of Fame train doesn't stop there, however. For 2014, Hall of Famers Luis Scott-Vargas and Ben Stark will be making their debuts as members of the official Wizards video teams at Grand Prix in the coming months.


 Expanding to this amount of coverage is a major undertaking, and it can't be done alone. Wizards of the Coast is partnering with [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing) and [StarCityGames](http://www.starcitygames.com/) to produce the live stream from Grand Prix run by those organizations. This relationship kicks off with Grand Prix Sacramento this weekend and continues with Grand Prix Richmond in March. For Grand Prix Melbourne, Wizards will be working with Sneak and Show to put together the first live video coverage from an Australian Grand Prix. For Japanese Grand Prix, [NicoNico](http://www.nicovideo.jp/) will be providing live video coverage in Japanese. 


Grand Prix that do not have live video coverage will have weekend-long text coverage at DailyMTG.com.


 It's a long way until December 2 and the start of the World Championship, but what a great trip it will be. Break out your calendars, mark the dates, and tune in to watch hundreds of hours of the greatest **Magic** players in the world battling it out for a seat at the biggest show of the year.
