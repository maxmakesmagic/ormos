Congrats Will Kreuger – 2022 MOCS Season 1 Showcase Champion!
-------------------------------------------------------------


Eight top *Magic Online* competitors entered Saturday's MOCS Season 1 Showcase, but in the end, Will Kreuger's TitanShift deck proved victorious!


Kreuger swept the *Vintage Cube* pod with mono-green, then nearly won the Modern portion as well, losing to Tom White's Grixis Death's Shadow in the pod finals. But an immediate rematch in the championship round led to Kreuger taking home $20,000 and the first invitation to next year's first Pro Tour in Charlotte!


Check out our coverage of the Season 1 Showcase on [Magic.gg](https://magic.gg/events/2022-magic-online-champions-showcase-season-1) now, including the video coverage.
