### Game One


"What's one mulligan?"


So said Canadian **Magic** fixture and part-time Zen monk Phil "psamms" Samms as he reshuffled and drew six. His opponent, BC's [Brand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brand)on Chreptyk, was playing Hero-Blade and had quickly kept his opening seven. Samms decided one mulligan was enough, and they were off.


Chreptyk led off with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), then set Samms's [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) back with [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). Chreptyk untapped, played a Sword of Feast and[Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famine) (with [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) at the ready), then passed it back. Samms replayed his Cobra, then used the bonus mana to [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth).


Chreptyk animated his Nexus, suited it up and hit, knocking [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) out of Samms's hand. Samms played a [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs), hit for two, and passed. Chreptyk again animated and equipped, and once the Nexus was in the Red Zone, Samms went for a [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) off his Catacombs. Chreptyk was ready with [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). Samms's frown deepened.


Samms untapped and tried an [Inferno](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno) Titan, but Chreptyk had [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to keep it off the board. Another attack from Chreptyk put him Samms to nine poison, and [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) all but sealed the deal. Samms drew, then scooped.

### Game Two


Chreptyk smiled. "My first poison kill. Though to be fair, it was the first game I've played with this deck."


Samms couldn't help but laugh. "Such daggers for no reason." He shook his head. "I played so bad that game. This is nothing new, of course. In Atlanta I \missed multiple Valakut triggers against LSV."


"LSV is a powerful wizard."


This game started at a more sedate pace. The two traded land drops for the first three turns. Samms broke the silence on turn four with [Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle) of Mul Daya. Chreptyk considered his options and his two untapped lands. He allowed it to resolve. Samms found a [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) on top, then [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap).


Chreptyk played [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) and passed it back. Samms drew his Trap, saw [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) on top, and shuffled it away with the Catacombs. That revealed another [Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle). Luckily for Samms he had another shuffle ready: [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). He fetched a pair of Valakuts, got a bonus mountain off his deck, and passed with [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) on top.


Chreptyk [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed, then chose to kill off the the Valakuts with two [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge)s. Samms Zenith'd up a second Titan, and that was good enough for the scoop.

### Game Three


Chreptyk opened with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and sent both to the bottom. Samms got out a quick pair of Cobras, and after Chreptyk summoned [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold), Samms busted out the turn-four Titan. Chreptyk was ready with [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), and bashed in with his Hero. Samms was happy to throw his Cobras in front to get rid of it. Chreptyk played a fifth land and passed with one mana open.


Samms wasted no time tapping six for [Inferno](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno) Titan, clearing out the soldier tokens. Chreptyk [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed and kept one, an [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) during Samms's turn. Samms replayed the Titan, forcing [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) from Chreptyk, but had [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) for the follow-up. It hit another [Inferno](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno) Titan, knocking Chreptyk to fourteen.


Chreptyk cast another [Hero of Bladehold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Bladehold) and passed. Samms tapped six for [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), and Chreptyk extended the hand.
