Sunday Coverage



Breaking through in his first Pro Tour Top 8 as the sole 36 match point player at the end of the Swiss rounds to survive the cut, Andrew Elenbogen of Cardboard Live made this Pro Tour one to remember.


After fighting in a match where he was uncertain if he had hopes of playing on Sunday, Elenbogen’s name was the only one called among the 36 match point finishers called in the Top 8 announcement, giving him his shot at a Pro Tour title in his fourth Pro Tour appearance, and one he gladly took on his path to a $50,000 first place prize.


His Sunday was not easy, as he had to defeat a rough matchup, one of the Pro Tour frontrunners of the weekend, and a Pro Tour legend to get the trophy. He overcame Wilson Mok’s Jeskai Control deck in the quarterfinals, surpassed Tay Jun Hao of Grey Ogre Games in the semifinals, and Luis Scott-Vargas of ChannelFireball in an epic five-game finale.


This weekend was also the home of the rarely-seen Player of the Year Playoff, the second in *Magic*’s history. Luis Salvatto and Seth Manfield battled it out in a unique best-of-seven for the title, with Luis Salvatto claiming 2017-18 Player of the Year. The win makes Salvatto the second Latin American Player of the Year in competitive *Magic* history, as well as Argentina’s first. Additionally, Samuel Ihlenfeldt was officially given his 2017-18 Rookie of the Year title and award after starting off the season with a Top 8 finish at Pro Tour *Ixalan*, his first Pro Tour ever.


The weekend was an exciting showcase of a brand new Standard Constructed format and a celebration of 2017-18 title winners and Pro Tour Hall of Fame inductees, but the Pro Tour wraps up for this weekend with the spotlight on Andrew Elenbogen, Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica* champion. Congratulations!
