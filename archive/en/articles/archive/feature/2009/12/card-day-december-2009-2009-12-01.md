![Infernal Spawn of Evil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil)**[Infernal Spawn of Evil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil)** – *Unglued* rare. The staff of Daily MTG is taking two weeks off to recharge their batteries. While we rerun our favorite articles from 2009, we encourage you to wrap yourself in a scarf, have some hot chocolate, and tell yourself "It's coming ... back on January 4, 2010."
 ![Goblin Bookie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Bookie)**[Goblin Bookie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bookie)** – *Unglued* common. Like many *Un-*cards, [Goblin Bookie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bookie) doesn't work perfectly within the rules. It turns out you can't activate an ability in the middle of another ability resolving. To do something like this in regular **Magic**, you want something like, say, [Krark's Thumb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark%27s+Thumb).
 ![Monss Goblin Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monss+Goblin+Raiders)**[Mons's Goblin Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mons%27s+Goblin+Raiders)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* common. Here's something to consider. [Mons's Goblin Raiders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mons%27s+Goblin+Raiders) is plural, which means that it takes more than one of them to make up a 1/1. Or there's the generic [Goblin Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Raider), which is a 2/2 all by itself. It turns out that Mons's personal goblins are actually weaker than the regular kind!
 ![Stream Hopper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stream+Hopper)**[Stream Hopper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stream+Hopper)** – *Eventide* common. The phrase "better half" usually refers to one's spouse. In the flavor text for [Stream Hopper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stream+Hopper), however, it appears to have been used literally. Just what made the missing left arm and leg better is left unexplained.
 ![Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob)**[Squee, Goblin Nabob](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob)** – *Tenth Edition* rare. Squee is many things: a member of the *Weatherlight* crew, a Vanguard card, comic relief, a combo enabler, a nabob ... the list goes on and on. But he rarely gets credit for being responsible for one of the great Stealth Puns in **Magic** history: the squeeze toy called [Squee's Toy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%27s+Toy).
 ![Arms Dealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arms+Dealer)**[Arms Dealer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arms+Dealer)** – *Mercadian Masques* uncommon. In *Mercadian Masques*, we saw a different kind of **Magic** goblin: smart and cunning, as opposed to dumb and wacky. But as [Kyren Glider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kyren+Glider) points out, they had their own flaw. Instead of the usual insane recklessness, Mercadian goblins tended toward the cowardly.
 ![Statecraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Statecraft)**[Statecraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Statecraft)** – *Mercadian Masques* rare. Instead of representing a magical [fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=fog) that keeps armies from finding each other, [Statecraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Statecraft) depicts the vizier of the Saprazzans physically separating a Mercadian and a Sprazzan. When things get rough, the vizier calls in [Saprazzan Bailiff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Saprazzan%2BBailiff).
 ![Thrull Retainer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thrull+Retainer)**[Thrull Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrull+Retainer)** – *Fallen Empires* uncommon. The flavor text for [Thrull Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrull+Retainer) comes from the second volume of *Sarpadian Empires*, which supplied many *Fallen Empires* cards. Back then, there were only six volumes. Years later, *Time Spiral* provided *[Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarpadian+Empires%2C+Vol.+VII)*.
 ![Crime/Punishment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crime%2FPunishment)**[Crime/Punishment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crime%2FPunishment)** – *Dissension* rare. Not only is [Crime/Punishment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crime%2FPunishment) a split card, it's actually split between guilds. The "Crime" side shows an Orzhov thrull digging in a cemetery, while the "Punishment" side has a Golgari shaman bringing forth a horde of bugs.
 ![Soulsworn Jury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soulsworn+Jury)**[Soulsworn Jury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulsworn+Jury)** – *Dissension* common. The [Soulsworn Jury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulsworn+Jury) acts as bodyguards for [Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV), who can be seen in the background of the Jury's art. 
 ![Counsel of the Soratami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Counsel+of+the+Soratami)**[Counsel of the Soratami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counsel+of+the+Soratami)** – *Tenth Edition* common. After its first appearance in *Champions of Kamigawa*, [Counsel of the Soratami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counsel+of+the+Soratami) had a brief run in the core set, showing up in both *Ninth Edition* and *Tenth Edition*. It was replaced by the less Kamigawa-specific [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) in ***Magic** 2010*.
 ![Tromp the Domains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tromp+the+Domains)**[Tromp the Domains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tromp+the+Domains)** – *Time Spiral* uncommon. The flavor text for [Tromp the Domains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tromp+the+Domains) references Benalia, Llanowar, Hurloon, and Urborg. Presumably, that makes the Domain count "four", with the missing basic land type being [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s.
 ![Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thoughtseize)**[Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)** – *Lorwyn* rare. Aleksi Briclot's art for [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) looks even better when it's blown up from card size. Check out the [Wallpaper of the Week](/en/node/602756) entry from 2007.
 ![Standing Troops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Standing+Troops)**[Standing Troops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standing+Troops)** – *Classic Sixth Edition* common. The name of [Standing Troops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standing+Troops) is kind of a joke. See, because the cards doesn't tap to attack, it stays vertical, or "standing". Hilarious!
 ![Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Werebear)**[Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear)** – *Odyssey* common. Mark Rosewater is [proud of Werebear](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-bad-things-happen-good-cards-2002-07-29) because it was the rare green mana producer that's good enough to stand next to [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves).
