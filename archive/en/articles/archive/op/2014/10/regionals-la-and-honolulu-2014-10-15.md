October 15, 2014
 










Last weekend, on many levels, was full of plane-shaking news tidbits. Whether it was related to program changes, the Pro Tour, the Standard format as a whole, upcoming PTQ seasons, do I go on?


Let's dive in.


First up...


FNM
===


Last weekend, Director of Global Organized Play Helene Bergeot [announced a change to Friday Night *Magic*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk/friday-night-magic-changes-2014-10-11). Starting in January 2015, stores will be able to choose which format they wish to run for their FNM events. This could be Standard, Modern, Legacy, Commander, Tribal Wars, Limited, and a whole lot more (previously, they were limited to Standard, Modern, or Sealed and Booster Draft).


The way stores receive and give out promo cards has also changed. Stores instead receive FNM promos based on their store level when they sanction their FNM events and will be able to choose how they distribute those cards to the players (previously, a promo card went to 1st and 2nd of an FNM, and two were given out randomly).


With these changes, stores will have more options in how they hold their events Friday night. They can keep doing things just like they have been doing it, but they could also sanction a Commander event for FNM, and give out FNM promos in a Commander event. Now stores can run the event that best fits their player base, and players will be able to play what they enjoy on Friday nights in a fun and social setting.


Pro Tour Qualifiers
===================


After that, Helene revealed the locations for the 31 Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers, which will take place on April 25, 2015, worldwide.


You can find the list of locations for these RPTQs [here,](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/rptqvan15) and if you'd like information on the upcoming Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier season, [head over here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/pptqvan15).


A couple of reminders:



* The Preliminary PTQs and Regional PTQs for this round will put players on the path to qualify for the Pro Tour in Vancouver, BC, which takes place July 31–August 2, 2015. This will run during the regular Pro Tour Qualifier round that qualifies for the Pro Tour in Brussels, which takes place April 10–12, 2015. Information on that PTQ round will be available by the end of the week. For a refresher on how the seasons overlap, [please refer to the original announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/new-path-pro-tour-2014-07-29) for the new PTQ system.
* The promo for participating in a Regional PTQ during 2015 is [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil).

Win a Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier from December 6, 2014, through February 22, 2015, and when you compete in that round's Regional PTQ, you'll get one of these!


GP LA
=====


This weekend features a [Grand Prix in Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-los-angeles-2014). The format? Standard, where we'll see if Abzan and Jeskai decks are able to continue their reign following the Pro Tour.


Grand Prix Los Angeles takes place at the LA Convention Center in downtown LA. As the Staples Center—home of the LA Lakers and LA Clippers—is in the same area, there are plenty of restaurants and hotels that are a short walk away, with restaurants offering a variety of food options (including many that are open late).


The drive from Los Angeles International Airport to the venue is 16 miles, but LA is notorious for its congested traffic—especially on Fridays, speaking from the experience of having lived in SoCal for two decades)—so if you're getting in on Friday, be prepared for the drive to be about 45 minutes to an hour. Plan accordingly, and consider carpooling if you are coordinating travel plans with other friends getting into LA around the same time.


Public transit via bus is an alternative. You can get routes and directions via [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Los+Angeles+International+Airport,+1+World+Way,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90045/Los+Angeles+Convention+Center,+1201+S+Figueroa+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90015/@34.0135282,-118.3561846,13z/data=!3m1!5s0x80c2c7b8b984fa5b:0xbb811745669040a8!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c2b0d213b24fb5:0x77a87b57698badf1!2m2!1d-118.40853!2d33.941589!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c2c7c76a01ef3d:0xf629c020e23429b5!2m2!1d-118.269562!2d34.040321!3e3). The expected time in transit if you're taking the bus is 1 hour 30 minutes, but this can vary again depending on traffic.


Main event registration for GP Los Angeles is limited to 2016 players, so if you're thinking about going, we recommend you preregister as soon as possible to secure your spot. Remember, all players who register for the main event will receive this exclusive playmat!

Now, where were we?...oh right, there was a Pro Tour last weekend!


The Flashback
=============


Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* heralded the new Standard format, where Jeskai and Abzan positioned themselves as the dominant clans to watch out for. Jeskai Wins, the three-color deck that rides a Mantis, a Goblin, or plenty of burn spells to victory, was the most played deck, but Abzan strategies weren't too far behind.


The Top 8 featured a mixture of archetypes, as well as more than a few notable players. Japanese superstar and 11th-ranked Yuuya Watanabe, as well as 16th-ranked Lee Shi Tian of Hong Kong, both earned their third career Pro Tour Top 8s last weekend. [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15) winner and 5th-ranked player Ivan Floch went back to back with another Top 8 this weekend, and 8th-ranked Shaun McLaren made his way to the finals in a hope to become the third person in history to get two Pro Tour wins in a calendar win.


However, it was longtime *Magic* grinder Ari Lax, who finally broke through to the Top 8 after multiple near misses in recent years, who took the down the event and took home the trophy, the $40,000 check, and Platinum Pro status.


You can read up on the full coverage of Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*  [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk), but here are some highlight pieces from the reporting staff:


[Breakout Card: Dig Through Time](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk/breakout-card-dig-through-time-2014-10-12)—Marc Calderaro talks to multiple pros to find out just how good [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) is. Spoiler alert: it's good, and control wouldn't be a thing without it right now.


[Drafting 5-Color with Ari Lax](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk/drafting-5-color-ari-lax-2014-10-11)—Ray "Blisterguy" Walkinshaw talks to eventual winner Ari Lax about the philosophy of drafting the four- and five-color archetypes in *Khans of Tarkir*Booster Draft.


[Passing the Torch](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk/passing-torch-2014-10-12)—Corbin Hosler talks to Sean Pottenger, a teacher from Hawaii and a longtime competitive player, who received a special invitation to this Pro Tour. He discusses Pottenger's history with the game, how he's integrating it into his life as a teacher, and even how he manages to arrange a special field trip for those who participate in his after-class games program.


If you missed last weekend's Pro Tour coverage, don't forget to check it out. There are some great games of *Magic* that were played in Honolulu. To those competing this weekend in GP Los Angeles, best of luck!


And once again, congratulation to last weekend's Pro Tour winner: Ari Lax!
