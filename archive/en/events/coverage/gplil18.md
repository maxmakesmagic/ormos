Day 2 Coverage



After Saturday's eight rounds the original field of 1,339 players was whittled down to a much more manageable 277. Now it was time for another seven rounds of *Guilds of Ravnica* Standard followed by the Top 8. Time to venerate some Loxodons, to arclight the way for some Phoenixes, to conduct runaway experiments in a steam-powered frenzy, and to ramp into lots of Carnage Tyrants.


Check back throughout the day for metagame info and decklists, watch all the action live from the battlefield and stay tuned for the conclusion of Grand Prix Lille 2018!







Day 1 Coverage



Hot off the printing presses and store shelves, *Guilds of Ravnica* has already taken over the format. All day long, Phoenixes were shining their Arclight, Loxodons were being venerated, runaway experiments were being conducted in a steam-powered frenzy, and the Golgari were swarming as usual.


After eight rounds, the original field of 1,339 was cut down to 277, and eleven players got to enjoy their evening with their perfect records of 8-0 still intact: Florian Trotte, Renato Spinelli, Francesco Giorgio, Rob Catton, Harry Garbett, Michael Blanc, Carlos Moral, Peter Vieren, Thomas Diedic, Alexandre Darras, and Thomas Angel. Congrats!


Join us and them and 266 others tomorrow—for decklists, for more Standard action, and for the conclusion of Grand Prix Lille 2018!
