Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 







Welcome to Feedback week here on **Magicthegathering.com**. The new core set has a lot of people brewing, and I'd like to respond to a few email requests and build a deck in the process. I've always been happy to explore the furthest reaches of an archetype.


The most frequent topic of emails I receive, excluding requests for non-budget lists, is deck building. Newer players often want a quantifiable method to deck building. Unfortunately, deck building is not usually a process that can be broken down into a uniform order of actions.


Finding a unique card that seems powerful is usually a good place to start your building process. A lot of people play **Magic** these days. It's probably unreasonable to start with cards like [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), and [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) because the decks that are built around those cards are likely near perfect in their tournament-winning forms. You can always add powerful and heavily played cards that turn out to fit your deck properly.


Now we need a powerful, yet overlooked, card to build around.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab102_slime.jpg)I've received a huge number of emails asking if it's possible to make a competitive deck that abuses [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime). To start, yes, it is certainly possible to build a competitive deck that wants to play with [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime). The card provides a total of 12 power if you get full value out of it. It also provides seven bodies. There are a number of routes we can take with a card like this. [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime) gives a [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire) +14/+14 if you sacrifice the whole enchilada. [Eldrazi Monument](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Monument) also seems like a very powerful way to abuse the ***Magic** 2011* rare.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab102_gameState.jpg)You want your deck to be a well-oiled machine.


Every card in your deck should help accomplish the same goal. When you're building an aggressive red deck your goal should be to reduce your opponent's life total from 20 to 0 as quickly as possible. A card like [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) is very good, but it doesn't belong in a deck that wants to end the game quickly.


So, what is the goal of the [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime) deck? [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime) is most powerful when used in tandem with cards that can abuse the token generation. Cards like [Eldrazi Monument](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Monument), [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire), and [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat) help us get maximum value out of our [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime).

Eldrazi Monument
 | 
Vampire Aristocrat
 |

The rest of our deck should help support this theme. The later additions may not have synergy with the Slime itself, but we can choose to play cards that work well with the token-generation abuse. [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) seems like the most obvious inclusion; it helps us ramp into spells like [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime) and [Eldrazi Monument](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Monument), it provides an early board presence, and it provides multiple bodies for our Vampires and Monument.

Kozilek's Predator
 | 
Nest Invader
 |

[Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator) fits the deck for the same reasons as [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader). The Predator may not be as curve friendly, but it helps accomplish the same goals.



![Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodghast)

Â 

[Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) has a lot of potential in a deck like this. You can sacrifice [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) to a [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire) or [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat), play a [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and activate the [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)'s trigger, sacrifice the [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) again, pop the Expanse and activate the trigger, and sacrifice the [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) again. That's a lot of damage.


[Pawn of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog) is another card that works well with our Vampires and Monument. I've wanted to play with this one for a while now. Imagine how much damage you could produce with the [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) play I just described if you had a [Pawn of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog) in play.

Doom Blade
 |

I worry about very large creatures on the other side of the table. I want to make sure our deck can successfully trick an opponent into not having a board presence for our attack. I want to round the list out with some removal. [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) seems like the most efficient answer available right now.


Here's what we have so far:


4 [Eldrazi Monument](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Monument)  

4 [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire)  

4 [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat)  

4 [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader)  

4 [Pawn of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog)  

4 [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)  

4 [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime)  

4 [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator)  

4 [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade)


Now it's time to build a mana base. This seems to give a lot of people trouble. I receive a lot of emails that include deck lists without the lands. I also get a lot of emails asking how I put together a mana base for a new deck.


Lets take a look at the mana requirements of our deck. I like to assign different weights to the mana requirements of spells with different converted casting costs. A spell that costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) has a much greater white requirement than a spell that costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif). Chances are, you want to play your ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) spell on turn two, not turn four. You want your deck's mana base to understand these complexities and be built accordingly.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab102_mana1.jpg)Spells like [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) or [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) would not be weighted as first- and second-turn plays because the cards don't lose value as the game progresses. Playing a removal spell is fine in the later stages of the game whereas playing a card like [Vampire Lacerator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Lacerator) has become unimpressive.


Here's the math I use when designing a new deck.


Mana symbols on spells that are intended as first turn plays are given a value of 5.  

Mana symbols on spells for the second turn are given a value of 4.  

Mana symbols on spells for the third turn are given a value of 3.  

Mana symbols on spells for the fourth turn are given a value of 2.  

Mana symbols on spells for the fifth turn are given a value of 1.5.  

Mana symbols on spells that you want to play after the fifth turn are given a value of 1.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab102_mana2.jpg)I'll design this deck's mana base using this method. All of the spells are four-ofs, so I can treat each card as an individual. We're just simplifying here. Remember that this formula is a good place to start with a new deck, but the only way to truly understand the mana requirements of a deck is to sit down and play a lot of games.


One-mana spells: None


Two-mana spells: [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire)

Three-mana spells: [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat), [Pawn of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog)

Four-mana spells: [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator)  

(1 x 2)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) = 2![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)


Five-mana spells: [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime)  

(1 x 1.5)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) = 1.5![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)


First let's add up the black requirement.  

12![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) + 9![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) = 21![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)


Then let's add up the green requirement.  

4![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) + 2![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) + 1.5![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) = 7.5![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)


The deck has a very clear need for black mana. The green is light, but [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) means we can't skimp too much. We don't have any one-mana spells, and we would like to abuse [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) as much as possible, I'd like to play with [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds). I want to maximize my chances of playing a turn two [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) when I want to without having to sacrifice my ability to play a turn two [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader). A 21-7.5 split brings me to a 12-5 split in the actual deck list. 12-5 may not be perfect, but it seems a lot better than 13-4.

Â 

I played a few games with the deck to see how it fared. The deck will probably do well in creature mirrors, but I imagine it has trouble with decks that play [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), and [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab102_pyro.jpg)I win the roll and keep [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat), [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime), [Pawn of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog). I play the Terrmorphic Expanse and pass. My opponent plays a [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn), pops it for an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and casts [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). I crack the Expanse, get a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and start my turn. I draw another [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), play a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), cast [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader), and pass the turn. My opponent casts a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), plays a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and passes the turn. I draw a [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), attack for 2, cast [Pawn of Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pawn+of+Ulamog), and pass the turn. My opponent casts a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) targeting the Pawn on my end step and I get another Eldrazi Spawn token. My opponent casts a [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond), plays another [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and passes the turn. I attack for 2 again, cast [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat), play my land, and pass the turn. My opponent casts a [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), casts [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and puts a counter on the Ascension, then passes with a red open.


I draw a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), play it, cast [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime), and attack with [Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader) and [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat). I sacrifice the Slime to the Aristocrat and my opponent lets it resolve. I sacrifice both Spawns to the [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat), and sacrifice each Slime token one by one. [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat) gets in for 20 damage all by itself and I win the game.

I draw a [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime), cast [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), sacrifice it to my Vampire, play my [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), return both [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)s, sacrifice both [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)s to my Vampire.

I draw a [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat), cast it, and attack with my team. My opponent has a [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), but I cast the Vampire Artistocrat before combat so I could sacrifice something if I needed to. My opponent targets the Slime, and I sacrifice it and make a pair of 2/2s. My opponent blocks both [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)s, and it becomes his turn again.

I draw an [Eldrazi Monument](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Monument) and cast it. I attack with my team.

My opponent has an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) for my Monument, but with only 1 life point remaining he concedes to my lethal attack the next turn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab102_hellspark.jpg)I lose the roll and keep [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire), [Mitotic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mitotic+Slime), [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat), [Kozilek's Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator).

My opponent shows me a [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) and the game is over.


This deck has the ability to get some really absurd draws. I don't think it has the consistency to be played at a very competitive level, but I think it definitely has what it takes to do well at your local FNM. Hopefully your deck-building skills have improved.


Happy Feedback Week!

P.S. I draft at Reality's Edge in North Arlington, New Jersey every Thursday night. Jim, the owner of the store, has decided to give four [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor)s to the winner of this Saturday's Standard tournament. Jim has been running a great gaming spot for a few years now and this tournament is a testament to how much he wants to give back to the community. I strongly recommend making the trip out to Reality's Edge this weekend if you have the chance.
