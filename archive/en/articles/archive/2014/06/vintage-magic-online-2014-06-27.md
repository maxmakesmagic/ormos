With the release of *Vintage Masters* on *Magic Online*, Vintage is now a real possibility! For the first time, you can collect pieces of the fabled [Power Nine](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/432) and start building your Vintage decks. Currently, Vintage Daily Events and Premier Events even have *Vintage Masters* packs for prizes!

*Magic Online* user safe\_haven has taken advantage of this, going 4–0 in the first *Magic Online* Vintage Daily Event. His weapon of choice is one of the strange decks enabled by the vast Vintage card pool—Dredge.


This deck is basically all-in on finding [Bazaar of Baghdad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad). When playing this deck, mulligan until you have a Bazaar in your opening hand (using [Serum Powder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Powder) as needed). [Bazaar of Baghdad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad) helps you get dredge cards in your graveyard and dredge them at a very quick rate. The majority of the rest of the deck operates from the graveyard, with [Bridge from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) and sacrifice triggers generating an army of lethal Zombies.
