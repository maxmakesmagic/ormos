**How Important Are 2-Drops In This Format?**


Properly building a Sealed pool is one of the trickiest skills to master. Subject entirely to the whims of whatever their six packs contain, players can have a tough time determining how exactly to balance the oft-times competing considerations of consistency, curve, and late-game clout. With that in mind, we asked some of the top pros in attendance at Grand Prix Atlantic City how much they value 2-drops at the moment. Are Grizzly Bears simply underpowered in this bomb-heavy Sealed format? Or are they a necessary evil to avoid falling too far behind your opponents?

*Luis Scott-Vargas said he was happy to play no 2-drops at all in his Sealed decks.*



“They're not incredibly important, and you can be fine with zero” said Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas. “Ideally you'll have a couple cards that cost three mana or less, but they don't have to be creatures—a removal spell works too.”



While 2-drops aren't a necessity, they are slightly more important than they were in the last Sealed format, before *Khans of Tarkir* vanished, he said. People are more likely to play two-color decks, and there are fewer comes-into-play-tapped lands now, so the value of a two-mana creature has gone up slightly, even if it is still not incredibly important, he said.

*Two-mana creatures are too easily outclassed by larger creatures to be of great value, according to Craig Wescoe.*



“They're not very important at all,” said No. 17 Craig Wescoe. “There's just so many cheap 4-toughness creatures that blank all of the 2-drops.” Consequently, it's very hard for a 2-drop to be good except for a few particular exceptions, such as [Atarka Beastbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka+Beastbreaker), or the exploit-enabling creatures such as [Palace Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palace+Familiar) or [Sultai Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Emissary).

*Adrian Sullivan said 2-drops were only good when paired with a particular supporting cast.*



“In the vast majority of decks they're not especially important,” said Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* Semifinalist Adrian Sullivan. For instance, in a deck with quality 1-drops, 2-drops go up in value. Or if a pool contains support cards, such as [Coat With Venom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+With+Venom), that are cheap and enable you to win a trade, 2-drops likewise begin to look more attractive, he said.

*Christian Calcano though a few 2-drops could be necessary to keep up, but cautioned not to go overboard on them.*



“They're important just because you don't want to fall behind, but you definitely don't want to overload on them,” said Christian Calcano, fresh off a Top 8 performance at the last Limited Grand Prix in Cleveland. “The games in this format tend to go later, so it's more important to secure your own high-end.”
