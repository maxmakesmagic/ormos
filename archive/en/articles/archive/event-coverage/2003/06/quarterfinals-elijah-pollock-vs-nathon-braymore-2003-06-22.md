Being crowned National Champion would be a big feather in the cap of Elijah Pollock, closing out a season that's seen him do so well with his teammates from 2020. Unfortunately for him, he's sitting across from Nathon Braymore and his mono-black control deck. That bodes ill for the veteran Pollock, who is with Blue-Green Madness, a deck he audibled into because he had the flu. 

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a907.jpg)Pollock started things with a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) that sent [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) to the graveyard. Braymore hit him with a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to see what was up, and it seemed like Pollock's gambit had gone horribly awry. Pollock held [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur), [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) and [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), but no second land. He lost the [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic). He proceeded to rip a forest and play his Looter.

"Of course I drew the forest, this is the Top 8." – Elijah Pollock

He wasn't done. [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) number two was waiting on top of his deck, so he could Loot into [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). Braymore Edicted away the Looter, but Pollock was rolling. He flashed back the Analysis and played Wild [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). 

 "Do you have the [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate)?" – Elijah Pollock

"I can't tell you that." – Nathon Braymore

"You've already answered." – Elijah Pollock

Braymore Scryed for two and got bashed down to eight. Pollock didn't even pause before throwing down [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur). Braymore scooped.

Pollock 1 – Braymore 0

 "Last night in playtesting I was 0-8 in presideboarded games. After boarding it gets a lot better, but that was just embarrassing." – Elijah Pollock

### Game 2

Braymore kicked off Game 2 with a first-turn [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). It showed Pollock's hand to be four land, [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) and [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Braymore stole the [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) and passed it back. Pollock played his island. Braymore wasted no time in busting out [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade). Pollock's [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) seemed weak by comparison.

The hits kept coming for Braymore. He swung for two and brought out [Withered Wretch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). Pollock tried discarding his Analysis to the [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), but Braymore was quick on the Wretch's ability.

"You can't fool me." – Nathon Braymore

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a909.jpg)Elijah hit for three but had nothing further. Braymore hit back for six. Pollock stood on four land, taking more damage, and again on five. Braymore added another Shade to the table. That was enough to convince Pollock to scoop.

"I had to try to mise with Deep. My draw was so bad." – Elijah Pollock

Pollock 1 – Braymore 1

### Game 3

Pollock started the third game with [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and Rootwalla, then swung for three on the following turn. Braymore made no play on two swamps, and Pollock tried to hit for another three. [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) forced his [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon). He dug for cards with [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) while Braymore brought out more swamps. Pollock flashed back the Analysis and made a [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). Braymore had another [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). Pollock had another [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon).

Braymore played his fifth swamp and was done. Pollock again tried a [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), and this time it stuck. Braymore made his sixth swamp. The Rootwalla jumped out at end of turn. Pollock untapped, Studied away a pair of Wurms, cast one, and still had mana open for [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). It looked like a coup. Braymore calmly untapped, dropped Cabal [Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffers), and followed up with [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) for six. Pollock had to pitch three cards to [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) it. Braymore spent his last six for a [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) on the Wurm token.

Pollock made another [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) token and swung in, bringing Braymore dangerously low. He played a seventh swamp, [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), and then Flashed it back, but Pollock had the [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) to shut it down. He bashed again and played and replayed a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), giving Braymore one more turn with a suspicious single blue up. Braymore drew, but was out of gas, and scooped.

 "You know how I was 0-8 presideboarded? Wanna know the grand total? 1-23. I've now doubled my playtest victories." – Elijah Pollock

Pollock 2 – Braymore 1

### Game 4

Pollock led with a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), and almost drew three cards off of it. Braymore made a disappointed face when Pollock caught himself. There wasn't much good news to be found for Pollock, though. He surprisingly pitched a pair of [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur)s. He played a second island on the next turn, and showed the weakness of his hand. He did have an [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). Braymore's third land was Cabal [Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffers).

"This is nice, he's manascrewed and my draw is god-awful." – Elijah Pollock

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a908.jpg)Pollock started to swing while Braymore found another [Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffers). He hit again, but then Braymore found a [Withered Wretch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). A second [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) did little to help Pollock's position. [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) for one got Braymore the swamp he so desperately needed. Another swamp followed and he was able to clear out Pollock's yard after a forest finally decided to show up for him.

That was all to clear the way for [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful). [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) bought Pollock a turn after Braymore played [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), but the big legend just came back down. Pollock had no play, just five lands. When Braymore Tutored and Forked it, Pollock was sure he was done. However, Braymore didn't go for a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), so Pollock would get one more chance to topdeck land six for his [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).

He did just that.

Braymore was first on the board with [Withered Wretch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch), and Edicted away Pollock's [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). He had another, but [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) forced out [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) hit the table again. The [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) hit again, trading a [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) from hand for Braymore's Wretch. Pollock got gutsy with a [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur). Braymore wasted no time Mutilating away the board.

"So it's a difference of $500, decided by one game?" -Nathan BraymorePollock flashed back his [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar), and was exposed to be empty-handed by Braymore's [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). A flashed-back Edict took care of the token. He topdecked a Looter and played it, but Braymore's plays of [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) and [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) outshined his. He Looted up a Centaur only to watch it Edicted away with [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara)'s help. He conceded.

Pollock 2 – Braymore 2

"So it's a difference of $500, decided by one game?" – Nathon Braymore

### Game 5

Pollock led with [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) in the deciding game, but Braymore had [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) at the ready. Pollock pitched [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and spent his third turn flashing it back. Braymore played a swamp and was done. Pollock tried [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), but it too fell to [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). Braymore took a moment to [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), and he didn't take long to choose [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara).

Pollock tapped out to hard-cast [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), and Braymore Tutored again, this time for Cabal [Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffers). Pollock flashed back his Analysis and Studied Rootwalla into play, ending his turn with three mana open.

Braymore went for it. He played a swamp and tried [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara). Pollock didn't even shake his head as he showed the [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Pollock cast another Analysis and played [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) with a blue mana open. Braymore made a second [Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffers) and tried [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate). Pollock [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)ed. Braymore [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate)d again.

Pollock had a lot of options. Braymore was low on cards. He hard-cast [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) of the Wurm and gave it back to Braymore, who found a backbreaking [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) for seven, with enough mana left over to Edict away the token. Pollock's advantage had evaporated. He flashed back his Analysis and [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar), but was in trouble. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) exposed two [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur)s, [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) of the Wurm, [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic). He took the [Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic), but had to burn for the excess mana in his pool to get it out of the madness zone. He still had enough left over to Edict the token and summon [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara).

Pollock clung to the hope that he'd be able to draw into [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). He [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon)ed the beast and worked his Analysis. He did manage an [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), then protected it from Edict with Rootwalla, but Braymore's next spell was [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother), and Rootwalla was no help against that. A big [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) finished things.

**Final Result:** Nathon Braymore defeats Elijah Pollock 3-2
