 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






Bryan Lyons was the winner of the 4-Way Solomon format. He was part of two pairs of players that decided to implement an all or nothing split with their neighbor during the draft. Bryan and Adam Benrstein made pile with 13 good cards and three piles of 4 miserable cards that they shipped to each other during the draft. Bryan’s deck was widely acknowledged to be the best of the 16 and he rode it to a 3-0 record without any game losses.

The format led to some interesting card interactions that you don’t see in limited formats restricted to one block. Dave William’s deck had the rarely seen combo of Rathi Assassin and Crowd Favorites and Mike Musser had one of my favorites on the day—Kyren Sniper and Sigil of Sleep.
