 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






What was being played on Day 2 of Grand Prix Oklahoma City? Like many of the recent large Modern tournaments there was a mix of usual favorites and emerging decks.

| **TOTAL** | **166** | **100.0%** |

There were plenty of popular decks, such as Affinity, Jund, and Infect, but rolling up the core of the archetypes revealed even more:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core Archetype | Total | % Field |
| Affinity | 25 | 15.1% |
| Black-Green (Rock) | 24 | 14.5% |
| Splinter Twin | 15 | 9.0% |
| Infect | 11 | 6.6% |
| Zoo | 10 | 6.0% |
| Burn | 9 | 5.4% |
| Merfolk | 9 | 5.4% |
| Red-Green Tron | 9 | 5.4% |
| Elves | 5 | 3.0% |
| All Other Decks | 49 | 29.5% |
| **TOTAL** | **166** | **100.0%** |

Here, Jund and Abzan combined show the allure and staying power of the black-green decks. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), whether you go with red or white next, is a powerful duo at the core of as many decks as [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating).


Similarly, when summed the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) flavors hold a firm third overall. While many adopted the [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang)-inclusive Grixis version, the longest running deck of Modern in Blue-Red [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) continued to prove it’s a deck you can expect at every event.


Infect’s rising presence was clear this weekend too, as well as the continued push of Zoo decks. Thanks to [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) for the former and [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) for the latter, aggressive creature decks are performing far better than a year ago. It’s also why Merfolk, with its ability to sidestep countermagic with [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) and often Islandwalk through most of the other decks in the format, rose in numbers.


Elves decks got a shot in the arm with both [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and a series of new tools in *Magic Origins*. Undefeated player Chris Lopez put both [Dwynen's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwynen%27s+Elite) and [Shaman of the Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+the+Pack) into his version as well, which carried him to a Day 1 undefeated finish.


Other decks made moves as well. Lantern Control was piloted to a Day 1 undefeated record in the hands of Zac Elsik, who pushed the deck into the Magic zeitgeist with his Top 16 finish at Grand Prix Charlotte. Joining him on Day 2 was another Lantern Control player, similar to how Amulet Bloom burst onto the stage with Justin Cohen’s finalist finish at Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*.


Of course, all the looks at the start of Day 2 are just suggestive. It’ll take a Top 8 playoff to determine the real rising stars of Modern this weekend, and a new champion at Grand Prix Oklahoma City.
