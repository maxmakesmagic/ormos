Remember the symbol of Phyrexia? We mentioned in an [earlier Arcana](/en/articles/archive/symbol-phyrexia-2004-02-16) how it crops up in the art of cards like [Order of Yawgmoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+Yawgmoth) and [Yawgmoth's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Edict), and looks a little something like this:

[Yawgmoth Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth+Demon) follows suit in its Pete Venters-illustrated *Ninth Edition* printing. Check it out.

Its head bears the mark of Phyrexia, and its staff has the circle-and-bar design as well. But of course, you don't have to be Phyrexian to order this artifact-hungry demon around. Just open a pack of *Ninth*.
