 This match features Robert Berni's Black Devotion deck against Daniel Ward's Bant Control deck. The match-up should be familiar for both players - Ward surely had to beat many Mono Black decks to get to the top 8, and even though this is Berni's first time playing against Bant Control, the difference between White-Blue, Esper, and Bant are very small, especially where this matchup is concerned ([Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave) are the only green cards in Ward's deck).




 Game one, in general, should be good for the control deck; the black deck has six removal spells that have almost no targets and few meaningful threats, letting the Bant deck just go over the top eventually. After board, things get a lot closer since Ward has access to four [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and two [Erebos, God of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead), replacing the cards that were previously very bad with all-stars, whereas Bant changes very little in terms of power level. The Games




 The match started slowly, with both players having no action in the first turns. On turn two, Ward played an untapped dual land, taking 2 and representing [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate). Now, Berni had a choice, he could call the bluff (or choose to get the [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) out of the way), or he could wait a turn. He chose to wait a turn, in the likelihood that Ward does not have another untapped land. He did just take two to play his land after all, which he would not have done if he had a basic land to play instead, so there is a decent chance he will not be able to cast [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) for two on the following turn. Ward played another untapped dual land on turn three, and Berni decided he's had enough waiting and cast a [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), which sure enough drew out the [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate).
