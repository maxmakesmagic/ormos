Grand Prix Cleveland 2017
-------------------------




* [DAY 2 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)
* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-1)


DAY 2 COVERAGE



Just over 100 teams are back to compete at Grand Prix Cleveland, and after five rounds of play exactly four will advance to the draft!


The tournament began with more than 500 teams, but after nine rounds of play exactly one stood on top. That would be Oliver Tiu, Shahar Shenhar and Ivan Floch, who came together as a team as a matter of convenience but left Day One of the event next to each other at the top.


Not far behind them lurk a pool of superstars, including the Peach Garden Oath, who are at 8-1 after narrowly losing to the team ahead of them in the final round. Also at 8-1 are Corey Burkhart, Shuhei Nakamura and Martin Juza, as well as Paul Reitzl, Matt Sperling and Dave Williams.


As we begin the final day of play, it’s still anyone’s tournament, and that’s sure to make for an exciting day. Tune in to [Twitch.tv/Magic](http://Twitch.tv/Magic) to watch it all unfold.

Just over 100 teams will return on Sunday to battle it out for a shot at the Top 4 in *Amonkhet*'s final bow before the release of *Hour of Devastation*. Five more rounds of Sealed will take us to the final four, who will then draft for a shot at the title and the trophy.
