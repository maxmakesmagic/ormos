**Reminder: Use your 2017 QPs before reset**


As a reminder, the last day to use your QPs from the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering Online* Championship Series will be on Saturday, October 21. Any QPs left on your account that were not earned after October 18, 2017 will leave your account during downtime on October 25.

**Standard MOCS Monthly this Saturday, October 21**


A *Magic Online*Championship Series (MOCS) Standard Monthly Event is coming up on October 21! Because this is the last MOCS Monthly event that you can use QPs earned during 2017, we have added an additional event. You can play in this event on October 21 at either 7 a.m. *or* 8 a.m. PT!


Players can spend 35 Qualifier Points (QPs) to enter. The series will contain 24 Monthly Events, each of which qualify top players for one of the four Playoff Events. These Playoff Events qualify top players for the *Magic Online*Championship, a Pro Tour, and the Pro Tour Challenge event at that Pro Tour.


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the year. Top players on the [Leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) at the end of the 2017 MOCS will qualify for the year-end Championship event.


We look forward to seeing you on October 21 for the last Monthly Event for the 2017 series! Learn more about the 2017 *Magic Online*Championship Series [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2017-magic-online-championship-series).
