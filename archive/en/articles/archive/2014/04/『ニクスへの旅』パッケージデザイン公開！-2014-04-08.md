Today we are diving into all the different packaging for *Journey into Nyx*. With *Theros* we had a green style, *Born of the Gods* had an orange-red hue, and with *Journey* we get purple.

### Boosters

First up we have a leonin who looks curiously like our old friend Ajani...

Some sort of Nyx-ified cyclopic monster. Wonder what it is...
