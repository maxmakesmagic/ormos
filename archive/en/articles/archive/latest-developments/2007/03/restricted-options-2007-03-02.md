Another three months gone by, another iteration of the [Banned & Restricted List](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/announce/dci20070301a) released. Once again, balance is prevailing over all the major formats, leaving us to do a minor bit of touch-up work with regards to Online Prismatic, but that's it.


**Online Prismatic:**  [Demonic Collusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Collusion), [Mystical Teachings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings), and [Supply // Demand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supply+%2F%2F+Demand) are banned.


In general, we have been banning all the decent tutors in that format, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

I've been getting some mail - and reading some articles - regarding taking cards off of the Vintage and Legacy B&R Lists. A surge of such requests says two things to me: There isn't anything wrong with those formats right now, so players turn their eyes on less critical issues, and some of the cards probably can come off.


We didn't have time to take the long, hard look at the lists that would preface the removal of cards from it this time around, but we plan on doing so before the June 1 announcement. If you have any opinions and/or data on what *you* think could come off the B&R Lists, feel free to drop me a line. Perhaps I'll write another article covering the suggestions like I did [back in '03](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/133).


With the high number of Constructed formats currently supported between *Magic**Online* and the paper game, it takes a good deal of work to stay on top of all the metagames and keep tabs on what cards are starting to warp environments where. Thinking about it all for the March 1st announcement got me wondering… *What if* there were no formats to Constructed *Magic*? What if it was all one big Vintage-style mess? How could we keep people interested in new cards? What would decks look like? [Read on…](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/af160b)
