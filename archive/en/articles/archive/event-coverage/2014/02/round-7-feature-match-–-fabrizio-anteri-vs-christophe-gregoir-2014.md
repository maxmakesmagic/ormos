Neither of these players is a stranger to the spotlight of the feature match area. Belgium's Christophe Gregoir has a Grand Prix as well as a Pro Tour Top 8 from a couple of years back, while Fabrizio Anteri made it to the Top 4 of two Grand Prix last year. This time, however, they met with scores of 4-2 each, needing three straight wins to even clinch a Day 2 berth!


The match-up here was Elves, played by Gregoir, versus Anteri's Storm. Both combo decks are capable of killing within the first three turns, but where Elves offers a little more resilience and can win in various ways, Storm is clearly ahead in pure speed. This, of course, bodes ill for Gregoir.

### Game 1


Anteri went first, but Gregoir had the first play in [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman). Then Anteri's [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) revealed another [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), [Heritage Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) as well as [Crop Rotation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crop+Rotation) and two [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith)s in Gregoir's hand. Zeniths and [Crop Rotation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crop+Rotation) were quickly discarded with two copies of [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), though.


With his hand thus demolished, Gregoir made some Elves, but those were getting nowhere, while Anteri had all the time in the world to set up his combo. [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), a pair of [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal)s, a pair of [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)s, and [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) for [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames) sealed the deal.


"Just show me [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony)," Gregoir asked, and Anteri happily obliged.

### Game 2


Unfortunately, Gregoir was forced to mulligan seven cards which included some sideboarded discard spells, and was left with the rather slow start of [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) on turn one, [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) on turn two.


Still more unfortunate, Anteri had a turn-two kill.


### Fabrizio Anteri 2-1 Christophe Gregoir


When asked about the six-card hand he kept, Gregoir explained that it wasn't great but, "It did have a turn-three [Natural Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order)."


"What do you get with that?" Anteri asked. "I'm sorry. I don't know the format very well." Gregoir showed him Ruric Thar, The Unbowed. Anteri was impressed. "Yup, that would have been game."
