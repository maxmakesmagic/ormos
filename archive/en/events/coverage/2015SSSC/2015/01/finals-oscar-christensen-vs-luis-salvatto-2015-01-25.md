The final match of the 2015 Super Sunday Series Championship pitted Oscar Christensen of Denmark against Luis Salvatto of Argentina. Representing two countries that were very much apart, the two—much like many of the competitors in this room—formed a friendship over the past few days.


While a sizable prize was on the line, the atmosphere of the finals was, much like the weekend, relaxed and fun, though a sense of seriousness did flow around the trophy and once the match got started. Christensen and Salvatto wished each other luck and the match got underway.


The Games
=========


The first game proved two points:


* Each of Christensen's big creatures were monsters that needed an immediate answer (hence the deck name)
* One of Christensen's monsters was a tad tricky to answer without a [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames): [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)

Sure enough, [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) was the key card of the game. When the [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) went monstrous, Salvattor shrugged and moved to the next game, a [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) stranded in his hand and unable to do anything against the giant red behemoth.


In the second game, Christensen had no blistering start, and the possibility of accelerating into [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) with a morphed [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) was cut short by a [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) when Salvatto's [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) attack in.

However, Salvatto was stalled on three lands with a hand full of dragons and [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) in hand. However, he made the best of it, casting Brimaz to trade with Christensen's [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds). [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) into [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) ensured Salvatto continued advancing his board, while also stopping another morphed [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic). Christensen was also stuck on three lands, but was not performing nearly as well with what he had.


With a board full of little tokens, Salvatto found a fourth land and cast [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege), naming Dragons. The resulting attacks left Christensen without any nonland permanents in play. While Christensen finally found enough lands to cast [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), the inevitably of [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) with Salvatto's attacking creatures sealed up the game, bringing this match to one final showdown.


The key to the third game was Salvatto's suite of removal. If sequenced correctly, Christensen's threats would post no problems. First up was [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler), and [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) along with an attack of three Goblins (created via [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst)) ensured the Planeswalker would be short-lived.

Next up was [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix), which Salvatto happily ignored in order to cast [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) naming Khans. Christensen deployed another Phoenix, hoping to dispatch his opponent before getting buried under the card draw power of the enchantment.


Christensen began to find lands, and was therefore able to start deploying more threats. However, it was too late. Salvatto traded card for card, bringing Christensen's board down to just a morphed Phoenix, the remnants of a [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) that had roasted the 4/1 bird earlier.


Salvatto happily traded [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker)s for [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)s, and as Christensen ran out of options, Salvatto's smaller follow-ups wrapped up the game, the match, and the championship as his opponent extended the hand.


**Congratulations to Luis Salvatto, 2015 Super Sunday Series Champion!**
