On October 7, universes will collide with *Magic: The Gathering*'s Universes Beyond *Warhammer 40,000* collaboration.

The collaboration will consist of four ready-to-play, preconstructed 100-card Commander decks and three *Secret Lair* drops. If you're new to *Magic*, Commander is an exciting, unique way to play *Magic* that is all about awesome legendary creatures, big plays, and battling your friends in epic multiplayer games! More information on the format can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/commander).

The First Previews
==================


As some within the Imperium are known to say, "While the enemies of the Emperor still draw breath, there can be no peace." But there can be preview cards! *Warhammer 40,000* has deep lore that we've evoked through each card. From basic lands to commander staples, each card has been reimagined and was chosen for its iconic flavor or gameplay impact.


Dates, artwork, and first previews for *Warhammer 40,000* were shared earlier on Weekly MTG.

Looking for a written breakdown? We've got all the preview cards right here.


![Abaddon, the Despoiler](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_EtUa2dPAlq.png)


First up is Abaddon, the Despoiler, the face of "The Ruinous Powers" deck. "Ruinous" is not an understatement for the power of this iconic character, either. Abaddon and his forces are so powerful in *Warhammer 40,000* lore that they literally tore the galaxy in two, divided by a tremendous warp rift known as the Cicatrix Maledictum.


![Blood for the Blood God](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_s0qLMmefZn.png)


"Blood for the blood god, Skulls for the skull throne" is the battle cry for the *Warhammer 40,000* Chaos legions of Khorne and his followers. Drawing strength from battle, Khorne's followers in the 41st Millennium are bloodthirsty zealots who live for war, and this card's mechanics reflect that flavor. This card costs less to cast as things on the battlefield die, whether those are your forces or an opponent's. Remember, "Khorne cares not from whence the blood flows, only that it flows."


![Vanguard Suppressor](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_1o3kly4H4t.png)


Vanguard Suppressors align with the *Warhammer 40,000* Ultramarines faction, who are defenders of Humanity and among the greatest of the Emperor's warriors. In addition to the great artwork, this card comes with an exciting new token-related mechanic.


![Fabricate](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_eBQrIIz1VM.png)


The promo card, Fabricate, won't appear in the Commander decks, but you can get your hands on it if you go to your local game store on launch day. This exciting card features Belisarius Cawl, one of the most powerful members of the Imperium and fabricator of some of *Warhammer 40,000*'s most legendary artifacts.


Finally, did our mention of a new, never-before-seen surge foil grab your interest? We’ll have pictures to share closer to release!
