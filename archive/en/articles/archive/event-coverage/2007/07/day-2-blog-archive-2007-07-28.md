Friday, 10:10 a.m. - Players to Watch
-------------------------------------



*by Tim Willoughby*

It's rather bright, and very early here at M-Fest day two, and players are filtering into the venue at a rare old pace, zipping around the room getting their last sideboard slots filled and sleeving up before the big event of the day, the first 6 rounds of UK nationals. While still a little sleep addled, I took the time to pick out a few players to watch, and where possible get some embarrassing photos of them to go with!


**Dave Grant**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/dave_grant.jpg)*Dave Grant, a bit TOO early in the morning*
One of the 'Old School' players who is always a good bet for Nationals, Dave was a bleary eyed blur this morning as he zipped around the hall scouring for the final cards for his Rakdos deck. Yesterday he could be seen asking for 'some red and black cards'. For anyone that took the time to find out what he needed, you'd find out that he was in fact 57 or so cards short. He had 3 Dark Confidant…


**Craig Stevenson**


The Starcitygames.com editor will still be the English National Champion at the end of the weekend, but he's still raring to add another trophy to the cabinet. One of the Mox Radio team for the event, he's been preparing with some of the best players in the country, and looked pretty happy going into the event. (We're pretty sure that what's in the bottle is water!)


**Calum Stephenson**


The other Stevenson from the finals of last year's English Nationals, Calum has spent all year thinking about **Magic**. He went undefeated in Standard in 2006, and has been working on his draft game intently with the rest of his team from Reading games store Eclectic Games. When asked about his deck for this year, he smiled a little. "It's pretty techy… I'm pretty happy with my choice".


**Daniel Yendall**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/daniel_yendall.jpg)*Daniel Yendall - ever-confident!*
Last year was Daniel Yendall's first multi-day event, and after he crashed out of RGD draft 0-3, he though, much like in any PTQ, that he was all done. When he was told that he could win out and make top eight, he just laughed, proceeded to do exactly that, and then narrowly missed out on making it into the national team. This year, he's raring for a second bite of the cherry, and looking frustratingly awake and confident in spite of having been up late into the night, working out the final card for his main deck. Oh to be 15 again.


**Quentin Martin**


**Magic**thegathering.com writer Quentin Martin is a little jet-lagged. He got back from Las Vegas on Thursday, after an extended stay in the US following PT San Diego, and went straight to work finding cards for his Standard deck. More naturally inclined to limited formats, Quentin is having a great season on the Pro Tour, and is chasing his very first Nationals top 8, to go along with his GP and Pro Tour finishes.


**Stuart Wright**


There is a core contingent of players whose big plan for Nationals is to ask Stuart Wright for a deck. Even if he gives you his second or third choice, it tends to be pretty incredible, as to the best of anyone's knowledge *all he does is play **Magic**.* This year, he's joined part of the Mox Radio team, along with Craig Stevenson, Craig 'Prof' Jones, Andrew Clayton, and Tom Harle, to name but a few.


**Nick Lovett**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/nick_lovett.jpg)*Last year's 3rd place at Worlds Nick Lovett*
Last year, Nick snuck onto the Welsh national team without too many people noticing, then proceeded not to lose a constructed match at Worlds until the semi-finals. Since then he's been enjoying level 3 status and flying around the world playing on the Pro Tour, and generally having a whale of a time. This year, he had two options going into the event… one 'exciting', and one 'boring Rakdos deck'. We on the coverage team are hoping for excitement, but Nick is known for making good constructed choices, so one way or another we're sure he'll choose the right one.


**Dan Paskins**


Dan has updated his list from last year's nationals. Now it's called Red Deck Wins 2007. No surprises there then. The original Red Mage, Dan will be throwing fire better than anyone else in the room once again, and showing people that while there might be five colours in **Magic**, it isn't necessarily a good idea to get distracted from the one that will burn you if you do. Dan might be the single person most happy that red's premier one drop is now not one that requires there to be a forest in play. Burn to shine Dan, burn to shine.


  


Friday, 10:15 a.m. - 178 Take on the Champ
------------------------------------------


*by Richard Hagon*

If Craig Stevenson is to defend his title, he will have to go through 178 others to get there. The huge success of M-fest has seen players from far and wide descend on Birmingham for the biggest event of the gaming year. Join us on the Metagame Runaround, as we see just how many Tarmogoyfs, Blood Crypts, and Mystical Teachings are going to be making the top tables. All the top plays, all the top players, here on **magicthegathering.com**.

Friday, 11:01 a.m. - Round 1: Quentin Martin vs. Craig Stevenson
----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/craig_v_quentin.jpg)*Round 1 Feature match Craig Stephenson vs Quentin Martin*
Round one saw a pretty saucy pairing - the current English National Champion against the English player who is currently at the top of the English game when it comes to Pro Tour performance. Quentin currently writes about limited for **magicthegathering.com**, and had his laptop all ready in case he needed to take notes.


Last time they played was at another nationals, where Quentin's [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari)'s Wake deck succumbed to the Blue/Green Madness of Mr Stevenson. Quentin won the roll this time though, and was all set to break Craig's streak.


Quentin began slowly with a karoo on turn two, followed up by a [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) from his Angelfire deck. Meanwhile Craig was unabashedly mono-green to begin, with [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) over the first few turns. Quentin had to discard two cards to his research, as the [Boros Garrison](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Garrison) he had in play had increased the number of cards he had in hand anyway. As he ditched two lands, he mumbled "misclick".


Craig had a [Glare of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) the following turn, showing that he was still pretty happy with the plan that had served him so well the year before. Quentin, the control player in the matchup, just continued to play land, and wait for Craig to bite first.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/Craig_stephenson.jpg)A [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) from Craig found [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic), who soon joined Craig's Mox Radio team. This was enough to prompt a [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) from Quentin, who had effectively, Time Walked Craig's following turn, which was consumed with paying for his pact. This time was used well by Martin, who made a couple of signets and [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) to get in with, taking the life totals to 18-17 in his favour.


[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Harmonic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonic+Sliver) from Craig (taking out a signet) were enough to stop Quentin's offence pretty handily, and he went back to the card drawing plan, using [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) to scry into the choice of [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), [Court Hussar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar) and two [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler)s. After some thought, he left them all on top, with the [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler)s not making it to his hand. The second [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) gave him a [Boros Garrison](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Garrison) and an [Izzet Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Signet) to think about. With a hand now consisting of [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), Bogarden Hellkite, [Court Hussar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar) and [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain), he chose to draw the mana sources, and still kept the Chronicler around.


Craig's turn was a little simpler, he simply got his beat on with everyone, including [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), or Monkey Town as it's now known given it's new Ape status when animated. He had a black source and a [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) for [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel), keeping up pressure while denying Quentin of any sort of offence. [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) plus [Court Hussar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar) followed, and Craig was left to continue on the [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) beats plan, making a welcome return to Standard from everyone but the control players.


Quentin did have an answer, with a [Bogardan Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Hellkite), who killed off Craig's team, only to be stymied by the combination of a [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) and [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) after combat. Quentin spent his turn on a suspended [Detritivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detritivore) for 3, and a suspended [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler) for 1, tapping out in the process. With a [Glare of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) on the board, punching through damage would be tough, and Craig seemed to have all the answers in the form of a [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer) to allow a swing taking Quentin down to 6, while Craig returned to a healthy 19 life. Quentin had plenty of [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler)s at his disposal, but no real answer to the threat on the board. He hard cast a [Detritivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detritivore), and suspended another Chronicler for 4 this time.


Craig didn't need to do a great deal more to win this game, making a few saprolings to work with his Glare, and beating with his Guildmage to seal up Game 1.


### Game 2


Quentin had a mulligan for game 2 on the play, but led off with a quick [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) on Craig's [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), and had a Signet to accelerate apace also. Craig's next threat was a troublesome one. [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) might well be the best threat in the format right now, and Quentin would have to race with lifegain or play [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) to deal with it. He chose the former option to start, using a second [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) on a [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) to effectively fog for a turn, (with bonus [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) thrown in).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/quentin_looks_fearful.jpg)*Quentin is looking afraid... or is it a bluff?*
Quentin was soon facing another [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), but his lifegain was keeping him nicely in the race, especially in the face of [Horizon Canopy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy) pain whittling down his opponent. Quentin had the time to suspend an [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler) for two, and left a [Court Hussar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar) in the way of [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) to buy the time to make the most of those cards. [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) on Monkey Town bought more time for Quentin, who was busily building up lands for a pontentially huge [Demonfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire).


[Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer) on [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) did not help this plan, and neither did a karoo bouncing [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) so that at some point it could attack again. [Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler) came in and swung Craig back down to 13, then [Take Possession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Possession) appeared to effectively neuter [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer).


Stevenson still had a few tricks up his sleeve though. On the following turn's swing he had [Stonewood Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invocation), to do enough damage that it would kill Quentin before the Warhammer trigger could resolve.


Craig Stevenson wins 2-0!


  


Friday, 11:44 a.m. - Round 2: Ian Pirouet vs. Calum Stephenson
--------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/calum_v_ian.jpg)*Round 2 Feature match Calum Stephenson vs Ian Pirouet*
Last year, both members of our round 2 feature match made it through to the top eight of English Nationals, and this feature match reporter managed to spectacularly Iain's name wrong. It's become something of a tradition now, so if any selective dyslexia appears in the coverage of the following games, it is all an in joke… promise. Both of these players are regulars at Eclectic Games in Reading and had tested the matchup pretty thoroughly, declaring it to be something of a bloodbath - one which they both desperately wanted to prevail in.


Piroetu led off with a suspended [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate), and had another shortly thereafter, while Calum was all about [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic), a pretty devastating creature given the suspend action going on. He had a [Griffin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) for it, and suddenly put Ina on a four turn clock. Venser said no to all that though, firstly bouncing the [Griffin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide), then blocking [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) who did not have regeneration mana up. Cloudskate number one put Calum back on land, before beating for a turn, before his friend joined in.


"All my cards are really bad."


"It's a problem isn't it" replied a cheerful Pirouto.


Calum played a Hierarch, and chuckled as his opponent missed on Aethermage's Touch at the end of turn. He was taking a lot of pain from [Horizon Canopy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy), but had the [Griffin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) for [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) to (hopefully) stem the beats. With just one card in hand, it looked that Ianis had run out of gas. Looks were deceiving though, as a [Bogardan Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Hellkite) sprung out to deal five to Stephenson's face. On just 4 now, he was dead to the team of flyers coming in.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/Calum_stephenson.jpg)*Calum Stephenson ponders on how to better Magic...*
### Game 2


On the play, Calum had a mulligan, but started with a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). His turn 3 [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) got hit by [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), then another one the very next turn, as Ignatious ramped up to [Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV). [Glare of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) then got stopped by a third [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), reduced in cost by the Azorius legend. [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) was hit by Venser, and Piratouet mana burned for one as he forgot about his Grand Arbiter. [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) was held off by [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) on Venser, and an impish Iguanodon continued to beat in. A flashed back [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) dealt with Hierarch again. A swing and a [Bogardan Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Hellkite) was enough to end it.


Indigo Pomegranite wins 2 - 0!


  


Friday, 12:12 p.m. - LCQ Decklists
----------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

 

There were a brave 8 players that were getting to be at about 2am, and back in for the first round of UK Nationals today, and here are their decklists. It seems that Slivers might be on to something in Standard as well as in block. One of the decklists appears to have shroud at the moment - but rest assured that if any new hotness shows up, you will get the decklists.

Friday, 12:44 p.m. - The Last Chances Run Out
---------------------------------------------


*by Richard Hagon*

 

In our second show from M-fest, we get a trader viewpoint on the potential Championship metagame, follow the Limited Last Chance Qualifier to it's epic late-night conclusion, and I become an official DCI Level 1 judge. Possibly.

Friday, 2:09 p.m. - Flashback!
------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

 

Aside from the main event of Great Britain Nationals today, there are a whole host of other formats and events for people to partake in. Aside from your regular, run of the mill, awesome PTQs, there are players reliving 2001 with *Odyssey* block sealed, doing flashback the old fashioned way, and having fun with Threshold along the way. For the rest of the weekend there are blocks going all the way back to Revised sealed deck!


Those dual lands might be interesting for the players of Legacy events running today, which are enjoying a whole new wave of interest in the format following the big announcement that the format will be supported at worlds. Stay tuned for the winning decklists on that one later on.


Yesterday we saw some precon tournaments, in which some of the more brutal pre-constructed decks of the last few years butted heads against each other, with the Jitte powered Rat's Nest proving it's worth. These will be running every day, and having looked at the stock room, there are precons going back all the way to Tempest block, some of which are very exciting.


Even with unseasonably awful weather warnings around the UK right now, the only danger of flood here at M-Fest is mana flood - or possibly event flood. If you can get here this weekend, do… you won't regret it.


  


Friday, 2:34 p.m. - Artistry
----------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

 

Here at M-Fest, we have 3 **Magic** artists in house doing signings, pictures, and selling prints of the various pieces of artwork they have produced in their illustrious careers.


Jean-Sebastien Rossbach is here with some beautiful illustrations including the [Edge of Autumn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) artwork, which is even more impressive as a large print than a future-shifted Sorcery.

Dave Kendall, whose latest masterpiece is the new Goblin token in 10th Edition is also here, along with R.K.Post, who when not signing Morphlings and Ichorids and [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel)s is showing off some of his stunning non-**Magic** art, including work for the Wizards of the Coast Dungeons and Dragons line.

For this event, as a little challenge, I gave each artist a Pro Player card to work with, to create a new token card. The results are, quite frankly, spectacular. Dave Kendall has turned Johnathan Sonne into a Goblin that isn't a million miles away from the new 10th ed artwork, for a classier [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander) Token. R.K. Post's Kenji Tsumura is a little demon who you definitely wouldn't want to sit down against. Finally we have Katsuhiro Mori as a Kamigawa block legend. Each of the artists here at the show really excelled themselves, showing that they are at these events to do more than just write their name on cards.

Friday, 4:07 p.m. - Round 5: Tom Harle vs. Andrew 'Boomer' Clayton
------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/andrew_v_tom.jpg)For some reason, in spite of the fact that Andrew Clayton was on the English national team last year, he rocked up to round 5 of the Great Britain Nationals with a plush Welsh dragon on his side. Tom Harle, who has also represented England at Worlds, and won an English Nationals back when it was a qualifier for UK Nationals way back when was clear in his sentiments. He was playing for England.


Both are members of the Mox Radio team, and entered the match pretty happy. Tom led out with an [Amrou Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout) who was quickly joined by [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse), while Boomer had a morph and the potentially devastating Chronazoa off a [Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) in spite of only having [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s and [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) in play - who might end up tough for Harle to remove.


For a race though, [Essence Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Sliver) from Harle looked likely to make things a little touch better, and he continued to lay the impressive white monsters, with a [Castle Raptors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Raptors). All in all the board was getting thoroughly gummed up, as Boomer replied with [Even the Odds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Even+the+Odds) and an [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher). In the short term it would be tough for either player to get much damage through, and Boomer used a [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) to keep his best threat, the Chronazoa, alive for long enough for it to multiply, while taking down [Castle Raptors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Raptors) in a double block.


A rebel search found Tom a Zealot *il-*Vec, who quickly despatched an [Icatian Crier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Crier), and then started whittling down the rest of Boomer's team, but Boomer wasn't about to get shaken off. He attacked with most of his team, and used a [Shaper Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) to take down [Essence Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Sliver). Tom made a [Kavu Primarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Primarch) with kicker, but was on the back foot to what was now a pair of [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa). Tom barrelled in, in what was now a race. Each player was at 15, with Boomer ruling the skies, while Tom was crashing in on the ground. [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) fetched up from Tom looked good, and when it was bounced by [Stormfront Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Riders) it looked even better.


Boomer played a [Dralnu, Lich Lord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dralnu%2C+Lich+Lord) and passed. He suddenly looked in a lot of trouble, behind on life, board presence and cards in hand. [Kavu Primarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Primarch) was acting like The Abyss for Tom, as Boomer kept throwing creatures in front of the kickered monster. Another [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse) got fetched by [Amrou Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout), making for a formidable team. A flashed back Marshalling Cry allowed for an attack for 32 points in total, and while Boomer had a few blockers, they weren't nearly enough


### Game 2


Boomer led off with a [Blade of the Sixth Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+of+the+Sixth+Pride), and followed up with [Icatian Crier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Crier), while Tom had the turn one [Shade of Trokair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade+of+Trokair) suspend, turn 2 [Amrou Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout), turn 3 [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll), for a pretty formidable force.


[Goldmeadow Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Lookout) came down for Boomer, who took a few beats the following turn from the aggressive force on the other side of the board. He had a [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) to follow up though, which looked solid in the face of a green white deck. Zealot *il-*Vec from Tom was a fine answer to [Goldmeadow Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Lookout), but he was, once more weathering [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) beats. A [Death Rattle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle) on [Zealot il-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealot+il-Vec) further compounded the trouble Tom appeared to be in, though he did play a Luscent Liminid which may have been able to block the [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa). Tom's rebels were again being fetched with some speed, and a [Stormfront Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Riders) added to Tom's air force, meaning that suddenly he could compete with a multiplying monster from Boomer. The game was suddenly tightening up, with each player sat on eight.


[Stonecloaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonecloaker) swapped places with a [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) token in the middle of a fight, but Tom had a [Castle Raptors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Raptors) to rule the air in spite of this setback. Ultimately, Andrew was forced to trade with them in a fight, clearing the board quite a lot on both sides, though ultimately in favour of Harle.


While [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) seemed to be providing some inevitability for Boomer, suddenly tempo was an issue. Tom's green/white deck was churning out quality creatures faster than Boomer could create blockers, and it wasn't long before an alpha strike saw Boomer scooping them up.


Tom Harle wins 2-0!


  


Friday, 5:15 p.m. - Round 6: Nick Lovett vs. Stephen Murray
-----------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/nick_lovett_v_stephen_murray.jpg)In case anyone was in any doubt about the fact that this was the United Kingdom Nationals, rather than the English Nationals, one need only look to the top of the standings going into round 6. Nick Lovett and Stephen Murray, members of the 2006 Welsh and Scottish national teams faced off at 5-0, with each agreeing that they didn't mind too much who won Nationals, as long as it isn't an English player. No national rivalries there.


Stephen launched off with a suspended [Infiltrator *il*-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor), while Nick had a morph for his third turn on the play. [Spiketail Drakeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling) came down for Murray, whose draft had solidified it's colours into blue white significantly before Nick ever settled down with his - having picked something of a rainbow of good cards early on before eventually settling into what was largely a red / green deck.


It was the blue white deck from Scotland that took the early lead with a [Sunlance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance) on Nick's only creature, the morph, revealing it to be a 1/5 [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity). Nick could already be seen to be leaning on the [Prismatic Lens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) he had in play, and got a two for one the following turn with a [Subterranean Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Shambler), which killed off the fresh Infiltrator, and a [Sarcomite Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomite+Myr) that Stephen had committed to the board.


Murray played [Voidstone Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voidstone+Gargoyle), naming [Ghostfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire), and started racing with Nick, with neither player blocking the other, and Nick dropping to 8 in short order. The difference was that Murray would ultimately be the one able to choose to block more easily - he was the one with all the fliers. [Malach of the Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malach+of+the+Dawn) made Murray's air force one point off being lethal, and Lovett thought hard before making any swings. He eventually went for it with [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity) and [Subterranean Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Shambler), getting in for a point, before a [Riddle of Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning) got pointed at [Voidstone Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voidstone+Gargoyle). Murray calmly looked at his hand and allowed it. A [Sulfurous Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast) got revealed to kill the 3/3, and Murray swung in to take Nick to 4, nearly low enough that he wouldn't be able to play his mass removal spell. A [Mistmeadow Skulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistmeadow+Skulk) seemed to ensure that the Blast would be a bad plan, and soon Nick was forced to scoop it up, in the face of another lethal attack.


"Now I know what to name with my Gargoyle." remarked Murray happily.


"[Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser)?"


"Yeah…"


### Game 2


Stephen led off with a powerful [Amrou Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout) in game 2 on the draw, while Nick accelerated out with both [Prismatic Lens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) and [Edge of Autumn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn). This let the Scot have a few turns to get his beat on, before [Quagnoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quagnoth) jumped into play, as 'not quite a dragon'. Murray flashed his hand of all lands and a [Sunlance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance)… not great, but not the worst when combined with a rebel searcher. Nick made a Firefright mage the following turn, while Andrew had a [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse) to fight back with thanks to his searcher. The rebel beat in, in a controversial play from Murray, while Nick continued to do the same with his 4/5 shroud monster. [Errant Doomsayers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Doomsayers) was the next rebel to join Murray's cause, but it still seemed to be a losing one, with him languishing on 12 life to his opponent's 17. Unphased, Murray just kept on beating, if beating is really the right term for the tiny plinks of damage he was applying.


Murray tried for a [Leaden Fists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists) on his [Amrou Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout) so that he could block and kill [Quagnoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quagnoth), but his creature fell to [Ghostfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostfire) in response, leaving Murray with few outs to pull things back. A kicked out [Pouncing Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Wurm) made life even tougher for Murray, who delayed things for a turn with [Snapback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), but dropped to 4 nevertheless. The following turn he scooped it up.


### Game 3


The first action of game 3 was a [Spiketail Drakeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling) from Murray, which was soon joined by a [Malach of the Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malach+of+the+Dawn). Nick got an unkicked Pouncing Kavu down, but it was swiftly [Sunlance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance)d, to keep Murray in dominating position. Nick played a [Llanowar Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Empath), revealing a [Riddle of Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning). Attacks the following turn dropped Nick to 10 before he could draw the removal spell, which traded with [Spiketail Drakeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling) without giving Nick the scry.


Things looked perilous for Nick, who dropped a [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) onto the board with a shrug. This was his chance, he would have to see if it worked. [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate) seemed to think not. Nick took a long look at his cards, and extended his hand.


Stephen Murray wins 2-1!


  


Friday, 6:06 p.m. - Saproling Mayhem!
-------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

 

The picture pretty much tells the story here. 20+ Saprolings in play on both sides. Even with a judge's help, things get a little silly when both players have a [Sprout Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm) in play, and there are rumours of at least one deck in draft one that ended up with *four*!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/saproling_war.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/saproling_messup.jpg)  


Friday, 7:33 p.m. - Round 7 Richard Moore vs. Stuart Wright
-----------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

 

"I have four more rares in my deck than Stuart does… something he appears to be quite worried about"


Richard Moore's deck is pretty nuts. [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation), Oros, Kaervek, [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows), etc. He went into the match a little downhearted to play against Stuart, who he has a nasty habit of losing to, but the 2005 English National Champion was definitely not offering the draw with his deck.


Stuart led off with a Looter *il-*Kor, and soon had a second to join it, while taking the beats from a [Blazing Blade Askari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Blade+Askari). All that card drawing found Stuart a [Spiketail Drakeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling), which quickly died to [Fatal Attraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Attraction).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gbnat07/Stu_v_Rich.jpg)Richard tried for a [Festering March](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+March), but was stopped by a [Logic Knot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic+Knot), which Stuart had proclaimed as they were shuffling up to have been really good for him in the draft, where apparently almost every other player has some number of dragons.


Stuart used [Stingscourger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger) to bounce Richard's only monster, and used [Llanowar Reborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Reborn) to make his goblin a 3/3. A cycled [Ichor Slick](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichor+Slick) killed the goblin, and Stuart continued to dig into his deck with Looters. Having drawn a whole bunch of extra cards over the course of the match, Stuart's draw was looking pretty good. At the end of turn, Moore played [Riddle of Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning) targeting Stuart, revealing Kaervek the Merciless. Stuart sighed.


"I don't know if you've got any more counterspells" said Rich, as he played his bomb.


Stuart just cast [Sprout Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm) with buyback, and then once again without, all before the legend resolved.


In the face of Kaervek, Stuart cast a morph, dutifully taking the zero damage from Kaervek.


Richard had a [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) for the morph, leading Stuart to muse that he might not be able to win the game without decking himself. Richard jumped up above 10, and finally Stuart showed that he had an answer to Kaervek, in the form of [Lightning Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe).


Richard's response? [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) followed by [Brain Gorgers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers). Nice deck.


Stuart played [Deadwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadwood+Treefolk), fetching back a [Sporoloth Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient). Richard had [Spitting Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Sliver), to Stuart's [Durkwood Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth). Having played Dredge in Standard, Stuart looked at his colossal graveyard and mused that it felt like playing Dredge again now.


Richard was on 7, and had to survive six more turns before Stuart decked himself. Attacks took him to 4, and the following turn an [Evolution Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolution+Charm) let the [Sporoloth Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient) swoop in for the final points.


**Game 2**


"Everyone else in the draft has decks full of bombs…"


"How are you doing so far?"


"3-0"


After mulligans on both sides, Richard led off with [Blazing Blade Askari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Blade+Askari) again, while Stuart had an [Aven Augur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur). The Augur got it's bounce on and Stuart looked like he might edge ahead with [Looter il-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor), until Richard ripped a [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows) to kill it, and followed up with a [Mass of Ghouls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+of+Ghouls). [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows) put a counter on the Augur, which got finished off by [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), before [Treacherous Urge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treacherous+Urge) dealt with [Deadwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadwood+Treefolk), putting Stuart to 'nearly dead'.


A [Spitting Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Sliver) came down for Mooreo, and it was over soonafter.


**Game 3**


Richard took a mulligan on the draw, and kept a 5 land [Serrated Arrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows) hand. As it turns out it was fine though, as he drew into [Ichor Slick](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichor+Slick) to kill [Thallid Germinator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Germinator), and was only taking a miniscule amount of beats from a [Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist). A morph from Stuart sped up the clock, especially with [Llanowar Reborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Reborn) making it bigger, but Rich dropped his Arrows, and was fighting back.


Stuart had his Spout Swarm though, which was always going to be making more threats than the arrows could deal with.


"Are you going to Riddle me in the face?"


"I'm thinking about it"


The Riddle happened, but Richard did not look like the sort of fellow to have a Kaervek on the top of his deck. He showed a [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) and nugged Stuart for 4. Wright made more Saprolings, and followed up with a [Durkwood Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth). Cradle to the Grave killed the big guy, then Tendrils and a [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) briefly cleared the board.


More Saprolings came, and with them more attacks. Richard was soon down to 10, and before Wright played a Looter *il-*Kor. Stuart nugged Mooreo with [Arc Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Blade), and it was all over. Richard flipped his next card, and showed the Oros. It didn't matter. Stuart had it.


Stuart Wright wins 2-1!
