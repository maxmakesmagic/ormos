Both players can breathe a sigh of relief. An invitation to World's is in the bag. Now there's a little matter of a title and earning a place on the National team. Paul Willis is running the newer incarnation of the Affinity deck with [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). Neil Rigby is running a blue-red control deck that features the awesome power of ...urm ...[Darksteel Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Gargoyle). 'We used to have a reputation for deck constructing,' - Sam Gomersall, from the audience.


Rigby went first and didn't do too much until casting a [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) and then a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). Willis whipped out a turn one [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) with the aid of two [Welding Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar)s but then stuttered along for a bit before bringing in a Ravager and Enforcer. Rigby made a [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) and was quite happy to Discombobulate the [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) that would have killed him.


Rigby did get smacked for 8. But it wasn't terminal and he blew up the world with [Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) on the next turn. His Ingot and Citadel survived. Rigby cast another and Willis, having recovered to two land, took the opportunity to fire off a [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) at his head to drop the Northerner to 3 life.


A couple of turns later Rigby tapped out for a [Concentrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) and Willis saw the opening to end the game with a second [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast).


Willis 1-0 Rigby


![Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magma+Jet)
Willis had to mulligan for a second time in the match. He kept his six but didn't have much action until he found a Worker on turn two. A [Welding Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar) saved it from [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), but Rigby still got to dig a little through his deck. Unfortunately that digging failed to find him a fourth land. Rigby allowed a Ravager to enter play and then went off to straighten out his mana problems with a [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). That found him a fourth land and then both a fifth land and blocker in the form of [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum).


Arcbound creatures don't exactly die easily. Once the dust settled from combat Willis was down two Workers and up one 5/5 Ravager. A [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) followed to make the scary Ravager even scarier. Rigby dropped an Oblivian Stone to nip that nonsense in the bud. His life total was a fragile 6 as he cast [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge).


The Stone blew up the world, a feature of Rigby's deck. Rigby left an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) open. A [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) went uncontested. Rigby tapped out to kill the Disciple at the end of turn with a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet). This spelled a swift end. In response Willis fired a [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) and the artifact hitting the graveyard triggered the Disciple for the final point of damage.


Paul Willis beats Neil Rigby 2-0.
