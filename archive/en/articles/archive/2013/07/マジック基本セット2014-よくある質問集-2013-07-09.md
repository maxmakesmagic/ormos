An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at Wizards.com/CustomerService.


This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.


The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**Returning Theme: Slivers**


***Magic** 2014*  features the return of creatures with the creature type Sliver. These popular creatures share abilities or power and toughness bonuses with other Slivers you control.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/CXEtkAReYk_EN.jpg)Galerider Sliver  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Creature — Sliver  

1/1  

Sliver creatures you control have flying.

* Unlike Slivers from previous sets, Slivers in this set affect only Sliver creatures you control. They don't grant bonuses to your opponents' Slivers. (Note that previous Sliver cards have not changed.)
* If you change the creature type of a Sliver you control so it's no longer a Sliver, it will no longer be affected by its own ability. Its ability will continue to affect other Sliver creatures you control.
* Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like flying, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.

**Cycle: Magus Staffs**


This set also includes a cycle of artifacts, each aligned to a color, that allow you to gain life for casting spells of that color or having basic lands of the type associated with that color enter the battlefield.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/qUkbp6Un7a_EN.jpg)Staff of the Sun Magus  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)  

Artifact  

Whenever you cast a white spell or a Plains enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life.

* Each of these artifacts cares about any land with the appropriate basic land type. For example, Staff of the Sun Magus's ability triggers when any land with the subtype Plains enters the battlefield under your control, not just lands named Plains.
* Many nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, [Azorius Guildgate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Guildgate) is neither a Plains nor an Island. Having one enter the battlefield under your control won't cause Staff of the Sun Magus's ability to trigger.
* If you cast a copy of a card that's a certain color, the appropriate Staff's ability will trigger. However, if you copy a spell on the stack without casting that copy, it will not.

**Returning Card Type: Planeswalkers**


A planeswalker is a powerful ally who fights by your side. With the exception of the "planeswalker uniqueness rule" (see the separate section below), the rules for planeswalkers have not changed with this release.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/NNQ2eZavpl_EN.jpg)Jace, Memory Adept  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Planeswalker — Jace  

4  

+1: Draw a card. Target player puts the top card of his or her library into his or her graveyard.  

0: Target player puts the top ten cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard.  

-7: Any number of target players each draw twenty cards.

* Planeswalkers are permanents. You can cast one at the time you could cast a sorcery. When your planeswalker spell resolves, it enters the battlefield under your control.
* Planeswalkers are not creatures. Spells and abilities that affect creatures won't affect them.
* Planeswalkers have loyalty. A planeswalker enters the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to the number printed in its lower right corner. Activating one of its abilities may cause it to gain or lose loyalty counters. Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from it. If it has no loyalty counters on it, it's put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
* Planeswalkers each have a number of activated abilities called "loyalty abilities." You can activate a loyalty ability of a planeswalker you control only at the time you could cast a sorcery and only if you haven't activated one of that planeswalker's loyalty abilities yet that turn.
* The cost to activate a planeswalker's loyalty ability is represented by a symbol with a number inside. Up-arrows contain positive numbers, such as "+1"; this means "Put one loyalty counter on this planeswalker." Down-arrows contain negative numbers, such as "-7"; this means "Remove seven loyalty counters from this planeswalker." A symbol with a "0" means "Put zero loyalty counters on this planeswalker."
* Activating a loyalty ability with a cost of 0 will leave the number of loyalty counters on that planeswalker unchanged.
* You can't activate a planeswalker's ability with a negative loyalty cost unless the planeswalker has at least that many loyalty counters on it.
* Planeswalkers can't attack (unless an effect turns the planeswalker into a creature). However, they can be attacked. Each of your attacking creatures can attack your opponent or a planeswalker that player controls. You say which as you declare attackers.
* If your planeswalkers are being attacked, you can block the attackers as normal.
* If a creature that's attacking a planeswalker isn't blocked, it'll deal its combat damage to that planeswalker. Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from it.
* If a source you control would deal noncombat damage to an opponent, you may have that source deal that damage to a planeswalker that opponent controls instead. For example, although you can't target a planeswalker with [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), you can target your opponent with [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), and then as [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) resolves, choose to have [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) deal its 2 damage to one of your opponent's planeswalkers. (You can't split up that damage between different players and/or planeswalkers.) If you have [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) deal its damage to a planeswalker, two loyalty counters are removed from it.

**Rule Change: The "Planeswalker Uniqueness Rule"**


Previously, if there were two or more planeswalkers that share a subtype (such as "Jace") on the battlefield, they would all be put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action. This rule is changing. The new rule is as follows:


704.5j If a player controls two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type, that player chooses one of them and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "planeswalker uniqueness rule."


**Rule Change: The "Legend Rule"**


Although there are no legendary permanents in the  ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* , the "legend rule" is changing along with this set. Under the previous rule, whenever two or more legendary permanents with the same name were on the battlefield, they were all put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action. This rule is changing to the following:


704.5k If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "legend rule."


**New Keyword: Indestructible**


Indestructible is a new keyword for an existing ability.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/IVNKfC6eK6_EN.jpg)Darksteel Ingot  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)  

Artifact  

Indestructible (Effects that say "destroy" don't destroy this artifact.)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.

* In most cases, indestructible becoming a keyword doesn't represent a functional change. There are two exceptions:
	+ Previously, if a permanent was made indestructible by a resolving spell or ability (such as [Withstand Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withstand+Death)), and then that permanent lost its abilities, it would still be indestructible. This was because indestructible wasn't an ability; it was just something true about the permanent. Now, the permanent will gain the ability indestructible, and it will lose this ability along with its other abilities.
	+ Previously, if a group of permanents were made indestructible by a resolving spell or ability (such as creatures you control being affected by [Rootborn Defenses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootborn+Defenses)), permanents that joined that group or entered the battlefield after that spell or ability resolved would also be indestructible. This was because the effect making the permanents indestructible wasn't changing any of those permanents' characteristics. Now, a permanent that enters the battlefield or comes under your control after the spell or ability resolves won't have indestructible as it wasn't under your control at the appropriate time to gain it.

### CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/zdo86rUGzL_EN.jpg)Academy Raider  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  

Creature — Human Warrior  

1/1  

Intimidate *(This creature can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or creatures that share a color with it.)*  

Whenever Academy Raider deals combat damage to a player, you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card.

* The triggered ability triggers just once each time Academy Raider deals combat damage to a player, regardless of how much damage it deals.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/2pGfcG5CXG_EN.jpg)Act of Treason  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  

Sorcery  

Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.  *(It can attack and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) this turn.)* 
* [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) can target any creature, including one that's untapped or one you already control.
* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.
* If you control a legendary creature and gain control of another legendary creature with the same name, you'll choose one to remain on the battlefield and put the other into its owner's graveyard.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/EQGx5VkFTW_EN.jpg)Advocate of the Beast  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  

Creature — Elf Shaman  

2/3  

At the beginning of your end step, put a +1/+1 counter on target Beast creature you control.

* If you don't control any Beast creatures as your end step begins, the ability will be removed from the stack and will have no effect.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/rNCd4Xwxzv_EN.jpg)Ajani, Caller of the Pride  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Planeswalker — Ajani  

4  

+1: Put a +1/+1 counter on up to one target creature.  

-3: Target creature gains flying and double strike until end of turn.  

-8: Put X 2/2 white Cat creature tokens onto the battlefield, where X is your life total.

* You can activate the first ability without a target. You'll still put one loyalty counter on Ajani when you activate the ability.
* The number of Cat tokens you put onto the battlefield is equal to your life total when the third ability resolves.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/alO4KrsCLl_EN.jpg)Ajani's Chosen  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Creature — Cat Soldier  

3/3  

Whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, put a 2/2 white Cat creature token onto the battlefield. If that enchantment is an Aura, you may attach it to the token.

* The ability doesn't trigger until the enchantment enters the battlefield. This means that, for example, you can't cast an Aura with enchant creature if there are no legal targets available, hoping to enchant the Cat token. Ajani's Chosen itself, however, may be a legal target for the Aura.
* If you cast an Aura targeting an opponent or a permanent controlled by an opponent, you control that Aura when it enters the battlefield. The ability of Ajani's Chosen will trigger.
* You may attach the Aura to the token only if it can legally enchant that token. For example, if the enchantment that entered the battlefield is an Aura with "enchant land," it won't move.
* You may attach the Aura to the Cat token only if the Aura and the token are both on the battlefield when the triggered ability resolves. If the Aura leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, it won't become attached to the token. If the token leaves the battlefield before the ability resolves, the Aura won't move.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m14/poi798sjkasd/jjaz2qrUBt_EN.jpg)Altar's Reap  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)  

Instant  

As an additional cost to cast [Altar's Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Reap), sacrifice a creature.  

Draw two cards.

* You must sacrifice exactly one creature to cast this spell. You can't cast it without sacrificing a creature, and you can't sacrifice more than one creature.
* Players can respond to this spell only after it's been cast and all its costs paid. This means that no one can try to destroy the creature you sacrificed to stop you from casting this spell.

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of each end step, if you gained 4 or more life this turn, put a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying onto the battlefield.

* Angelic Accord's ability checks how much life you've gained during the turn, not what your life total is compared to what it was when the turn began. For example, if you start the turn at 10 life, gain 6 life during the turn, then lose 6 life later that turn, the ability will trigger.
* If you haven't gained 4 or more life during the turn when the end step begins, the ability won't trigger at all. Gaining life during the end step won't cause the ability to trigger.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate isn't considered, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.

Creature — Human Wizard  

1/2  

When [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer) enters the battlefield, return target instant or sorcery card from your graveyard to your hand.

* If an instant or sorcery spell puts [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer) onto the battlefield, you can choose that card as the target and return it to your hand.

3/4  

Flying  
[Lifelink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink)*(Damage dealt by this creature also causes you to gain that much life.)*  

Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.

* The ability triggers just once from each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Soulmender or 5 life from [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality).
* A creature with lifelink dealing combat damage is a single life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Archangel of Thune's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.

Enchant Equipment  

At the beginning of your upkeep, if enchanted Equipment is attached to a creature, destroy that creature.

* The ability checks to see if the enchanted Equipment is attached to a creature as your upkeep begins. If it's not, the ability won't trigger at all. If it is, the ability will check again as it tries to resolve. If the enchanted Equipment isn't attached to a creature at that time, the ability won't do anything.
* This ability triggers at the beginning of the upkeep of the controller of Artificer's Hex, not the upkeep of the controller of the enchanted Equipment or the creature that Equipment is attached to.
* Players can't pay an Equipment's equip cost to unattach that Equipment to stop Artificer's Hex from destroying a creature.
* In some rare cases, the creature the enchanted Equipment is attached to as the ability resolves isn't the same one as the one it was attached to when it triggered. In such a case, the creature the Equipment is attached to when the ability resolves is destroyed.

Enchant Mountain  

Enchanted Mountain is a 7/7 red Giant creature with haste. It's still a land.

* Awaken the Ancient can enchant any land with the subtype Mountain, not just one named Mountain.
* The enchanted Mountain retains any other types or subtypes it may have. You can still tap it to add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) to your mana pool. It can be affected by anything that affects either a land or a creature.
* This doesn't count as a creature entering the battlefield. The Mountain was already on the battlefield; it only changed types.
* If the enchanted Mountain stops being a Mountain for any reason, Awaken the Ancient will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
* Copies of the enchanted Mountain won't be 7/7 red Giant creatures with haste. For example, if Awaken the Ancient is enchanting a basic Mountain, a copy of that creature would just be a basic Mountain.

Creature — Human Cleric  

2/2  

When Banisher Priest enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls until Banisher Priest leaves the battlefield. *(That creature returns under its owner's control.)*
* Banisher Priest's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). However, unlike [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), cards like Banisher Priest have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Banisher Priest leaves the battlefield.
* If Banisher Priest leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Banisher Priest leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone), it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of Banisher Priest.
* In a multiplayer game, if Banisher Priest's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

* Barrage of Expendables deals the damage, not the sacrificed creature. Notably, that creature having deathtouch or lifelink provides no additional benefit.
* Because targets are chosen before costs are paid, it is possible to choose a creature as the target of the ability and then sacrifice that creature. The ability will be countered when it tries to resolve and no damage will be dealt.

Enchantment  

Whenever a player taps a nonbasic land for mana, Burning Earth deals 1 damage to that player.

* To tap a land for mana is to activate one of that land's mana abilities that has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) in its activation cost.
* The ability will trigger each time a nonbasic land is tapped for mana. Each of these abilities goes on the stack and resolves separately.
* If any nonbasic lands are tapped for mana while a player is casting a spell or activating an ability, Burning Earth's ability will trigger that many times and wait. When the player finishes casting that spell or activating that ability, Burning Earth's triggered abilities are put on the stack on top of it. Burning Earth's abilities will resolve first.
* On the other hand, a player can tap nonbasic lands for mana, put the Burning Earth triggered abilities on the stack, and then respond to those abilities by casting an instant spell or activating an ability using that mana. In that case, the instant spell or activated ability will resolve first.

* If the player sacrifices a blocking creature, any attacking creature it was blocking remains blocked. Unless that attacking creature has trample or is being blocked by another creature, it won't assign or deal combat damage.
* Creatures continue to be attacking or blocking creatures through the end of combat step. It is possible to cast Celestial Flare within combat but after combat damage is dealt (specifically, during the combat damage step or the end of combat step). Only attacking and blocking creatures that survived combat damage can be sacrificed at this time.

Planeswalker — Chandra  

4  

+1: Chandra, Pyromaster deals 1 damage to target player and 1 damage to up to one target creature that player controls. That creature can't block this turn.  

0: Exile the top card of your library. You may play it this turn.  

-7: Exile the top ten cards of your library. Choose an instant or sorcery card exiled this way and copy it three times. You may cast the copies without paying their mana costs.

* To activate the first ability, you must target a player but you can choose to not target any creatures.
* If a creature is targeted by the first ability, it won't be able to block even if the damage is prevented.
* The card exiled by the second ability is exiled face up. Playing it follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* If you exile a land card using the second ability, you may play that land only if you have any available land plays. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
* In the third ability, "exiled this way" means the cards you just exiled because of that ability resolving. Cards exiled with the second ability or with previous activations of the third ability don't count.
* While resolving the third ability, you create the copies of the card in exile and cast them from exile. You can cast zero, one, two, or all three copies. The card itself isn't cast. It remains exiled.
* While casting the copies for the third ability, timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," are not.
* Because you're playing the copies "without paying their mana costs," you can't pay any alternative costs for the copies. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the copies have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the copied card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value when casting the copies.

For example, if the returning creature is a [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone), it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of Colossal Whale.
* In a multiplayer game, if Colossal Whale's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

Choose target creature card in a graveyard that was put there from the battlefield this turn. Put that card onto the battlefield under your control.

* You can choose a creature card in any player's graveyard as long as that card was put there from the battlefield during the turn. A creature card that was put into a graveyard from anywhere else, such as a card that was discarded, can't be chosen as the target.
* Creature spells that are countered never entered the battlefield, so those cards can't be chosen as the target of Grim Return.

At the beginning of your upkeep, look at the top card of your library. If it's a land card, you may put it onto the battlefield.

* If the card is not a land card, or you choose not to put it onto the battlefield, it will stay on top of your library. In most cases, you'll then draw it during your draw step.

* If you activate Jace's first ability and the player is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't draw a card.
* If Jace's third ability causes a player to draw more cards than are left in his or her library, that player loses the game as a state-based action. If this ability causes all players to do this, the game is a draw.

When Jace's Mindseeker enters the battlefield, target opponent puts the top five cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard. You may cast an instant or sorcery card from among them without paying its mana cost.

* If you cast an instant or sorcery card this way, you do so while the ability of Jace's Mindseeker is resolving. If you choose not to (or can't), you won't get a chance to cast one later.
* "From among them" means the five cards put into the graveyard, not all cards in that graveyard.
* When casting an instant or sorcery card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If a card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
* \* If the five cards are put into a public zone such as exile instead of a graveyard (perhaps due to the ability of [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace)), you can cast one of those instant or sorcery cards from that zone.

Whenever Kalonian Hydra attacks, double the number of +1/+1 counters on each creature you control.

Effects that interact with counters (such as the one created by [Corpsejack Menace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpsejack+Menace)'s ability) may change the number of counters ultimately put on the creature.

As long as your life total is greater than or equal to your starting life total, creatures you control get +1/+1.  

Whenever one or more creatures you control attack, you gain life equal to the number of attacking creatures.

* Your *starting life total* is the life total you began the game with, keeping in mind the format you're playing and, in some rare cases, anything that affects your starting life total (for example, a vanguard with a life modifier).
* In most games, your starting life total is 20. In a Commander game, your starting life total is 40 instead. In a Two-Headed Giant game, Path of Bravery compares your team's life total to your team's starting life total, which is 30.
* Path of Bravery's triggered ability triggers only once, after attacking creatures are declared. For example, if you attack with five creatures, you'll gain 5 life as a single life-gain event.
* If a creature enters the battlefield attacking after attacking creatures have been declared, the ability won't trigger again because you didn't declare that creature as an attacking creature. However, if enters the battlefield before the ability resolves, it will be counted when determining how much life is gained.

* The converted mana cost of a permanent is determined by the mana symbols printed in its mana cost (upper right corner). The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) has converted mana cost 5.

* If a nonland permanent has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a token that's not copying something else, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.
* A token that's copying another permanent has the converted mana cost of that permanent.
* \* The number of charge counters on [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) when it was sacrificed is used to determine which nonland permanents will be destroyed.
* \* [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb)'s second ability destroys only nonland permanents with converted mana cost exactly equal to the number of charge counters on [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb).

You may choose new targets for the copy. *(A triggered ability uses the words "when," "whenever," or "at.")*
* Strionic Resonator targets a triggered ability that has triggered and is on the stack.
* The source of the copy is the same as the source of the original ability.
* If the triggered ability is modal (that is, if it says "Choose one —" or similar), the mode is copied and can't be changed.
* \* If the triggered ability divides damage or distributes counters among a number of targets (for example, the ability of [Bogardan Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Hellkite)), the division and number of targets can't be changed. If you choose new targets, you must choose the same number of targets.
* \* Any choices made when the triggered ability resolves won't have been made yet when it's copied. Any such choices will be made separately when the copy resolves. If the triggered ability asks you to pay a cost (for example, as the extort ability from the *Return to Ravnica*block does), you pay that cost for the copy.
* \* If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, copies of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by the triggered ability and the copy. For example, if [Exclusion Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclusion+Ritual)'s enters-the-battlefield ability is copied and two nonland permanents are exiled, players can't cast spells with the same name as either exiled card.
* In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability is copied, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.

Vastwood Hydra enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it.  

When Vastwood Hydra dies, you may distribute a number of +1/+1 counters equal to the number of +1/+1 counters on Vastwood Hydra among any number of creatures you control.

* The ability that triggers when Vastwood Hydra dies doesn't target any of the creatures. You can choose to put counters on a creature with protection from green, for example.
* You choose how the counters will be distributed when the ability resolves.
* In some unusual cases, Vastwood Hydra will have enough -1/-1 counters put on it to make its toughness 0 or less. If this happens, the ability will still distribute a number of +1/+1 counters equal to the number of +1/+1 counters on Vastwood Hydra before the -1/-1 counters were put on it. For example, if Vastwood Hydra has two +1/+1 counters on it and three -1/-1 counters are put on it, two +1/+1 counters will be distributed.

* \* If the creature card is an illegal target when [Vile Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Rebirth) tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't put a Zombie token onto the battlefield.

Creature — Wurm  

2/2  

Voracious Wurm enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the amount of life you've gained this turn.

* Voracious Wurm's ability checks how much life you've gained during the turn, not what your life total is compared to what it was when the turn began. For example, if you start the turn at 10 life, gain 6 life during the turn, then lose 6 life later that turn, Voracious Wurm will enter the battlefield with six +1/+1 counters.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate isn't considered, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.

0/7  

Defender *(This creature can't attack.)*  

Whenever [Wall of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost) blocks a creature, that creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.

* \* [Wall of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost)'s triggered ability tracks the creature, but not its controller. If the creature changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step has come around, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.

Flying  

Creature spells with flying you cast cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) less to cast.

* A creature spell that doesn't have flying won't cost less even if the creature it will become would have flying once on the battlefield. For example, if you control [Galerider Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galerider+Sliver), other Sliver spells won't cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) less even though those Slivers will have flying once they're on the battlefield.
* The ability can't reduce the colored mana requirement of a creature spell with flying.

* \* You can activate [Water Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant)'s second ability even if doing so would cause [Water Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant)'s power to be less than 0. If [Water Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant)'s power is less than 0, treat it as 0 for all purposes except for further modifying it, or causing the power of another creature (such as [Riptide Mangler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Mangler)) to become equal to it.

As an additional cost to cast [Wild Guess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Guess), discard a card.  

Draw two cards.

* \* Because discarding a card is an additional cost, you can't cast [Wild Guess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Guess) if you have no other cards in hand.

Instant  

You may choose new targets for target instant or sorcery spell. Then copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.

* \* [Wild Ricochet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets. It doesn't matter who controls it.
* \* When [Wild Ricochet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. You control the copy. The controller of the original spell retains control of that spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities. The copy resolves before the original spell.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* \* If the spell [Wild Ricochet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* \* If the spell [Wild Ricochet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet) copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Volcanic Geyser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Geyser) does), the copy has the same value of X.
* \* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling), and you copy it with [Wild Ricochet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet), the copy of [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) will also deal 3 damage to its target.
* If the copy says that it affects "you," it affects the controller of the copy, not the controller of the original spell. Similarly, if the copy says that it affects an "opponent," it affects an opponent of the copy's controller, not an opponent of the original spell's controller.

Creature — Sphinx  

3/7  

Flying  

Whenever a creature with flying attacks, you may draw a card.

* It doesn't matter who controls the creature with flying or what player or planeswalker that creature is attacking.
* Windreader Sphinx's ability will trigger when it itself attacks.
* The creature must have flying when declared as an attacking creature in order for Windreader Sphinx's ability to trigger. For example, attacking with Trained Condor (a creature with flying and "Whenever Trained Condor attacks, another target creature you control gains flying until end of turn.") and a creature without flying will cause the ability to trigger only once.

3/3  

Hexproof *(This creature can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.)*  

Whenever an opponent casts a blue or black spell during your turn, put a +1/+1 counter on Witchstalker.

* The counter will be put on Witchstalker before the spell cast by an opponent resolves.
* If an opponent casts a copy of a card that's blue or black during your turn (as opposed to putting a copy of such a spell directly on the stack), the ability will also trigger. Check for the word "cast" in the effect that creates the copy.

2/2  

Whenever Xathrid Necromancer or another Human creature you control dies, put a 2/2 black Zombie creature token onto the battlefield tapped.

* If Xathrid Necromancer dies at the same time as another Human creature you control, its ability will trigger twice.

2/1  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, put a 1/1 red Elemental creature token onto the battlefield.

* You'll put the Elemental token onto the battlefield before the instant or sorcery spell you cast resolves but after any targets of that spell are chosen.
