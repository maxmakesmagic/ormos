Keep watching this space, because on Tuesday and Wednesday, **Magic** Arcana will be revealing the *Eventide* videos for two new mechanics, chroma and retrace. (Like last time, we'll also be adding the videos to each applicable language's product page in the [*Eventide* minisite](http://luna.wotc.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/eventide/home) as we move forward, so if you miss anything you'll be able to find everything there in one handy place.)


In the meantime, you can also review the following *Shadowmoor* videos in preparation for your *Eventide* exploits.


**All videos & Wizards of the Coast, Inc.** The *Eventide* street release and [Launch Parties](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/events/releases) kick off on July 25, but you don't have to wait. Get your first chance to play with *Eventide* cards at the [Prerelease](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) on April 19 and 20!
