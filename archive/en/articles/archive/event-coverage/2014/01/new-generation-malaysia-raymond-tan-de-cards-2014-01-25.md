Raymond Tan of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is on a roll! After reaching the top 8 of Return of Ravnica Limited Grand Prix Bangkok 2013, he followed that by taking home the trophy at Standard Grand Prix Kitakyushu 2013.


Look out Pro scene! This self-effacing (he attributes his performance to pure luck) master of both Limited and Constructed formats has set his sights on the big stage. It would be his first trip to Worlds and to the Pro Tour and he wants to make an impact.

*Raymond Tan* 


Raymond currently prepares with team DE Cards, a coalition of Malaysian players based in Kuala Lumpur and named for the store they frequent. Being a local group, they are able to engage in more face-to-face testing, which involves building the entire gauntlet and predicting the metagame for Constructed and determining draft picks together for Limited. MTGO features prominently in the lead up to a major tournament.


For *Theros* Limited, Raymond has a preference for blue-x tempo decks. He is running just such a concoction today and is fortunate his pool includes bombs like [Shipbreaker Kraken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipbreaker+Kraken) and [Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx).


He believes *Born of Gods* would boost the power level of black and RG. It would be a more challenging draft format going from 3 *Theros* to 1 *Born of Gods* and 2 *Theros* as archetype synergies and power levels are redefined.


On specific cards, he thinks [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) is the sure non-rare first pick.
