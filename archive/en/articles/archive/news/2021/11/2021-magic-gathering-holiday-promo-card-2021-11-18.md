 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






Generously giving gifts is always a delightâ€”especially when something special comes together in the last moments.


We all know that certain someone who deserves *just the right thing*. Something elusive yet ordinary, but you *just know it* when you see it.


Good news for partners, stores, employees, and friends of Wizards of the Coast! We have precisely that kind of extraordinary offering, arriving soon as a token of our appreciation. We know it's what you never knew you wanted.

Enjoy it! Thank *you* for an unforgettable year!
