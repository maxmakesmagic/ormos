This week's Sketches looks at the *Judgment* rare [Golden Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Wish) by Alan Pollack.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This is a white card and should show a djinn offering a female nomad a splendid looking glowing ring. The nomad should appear overjoyed to receive the gift."


The card was originally called "Nomad's Wish."


### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Alan. 

Alan then voluntarily sent in a second sketch, fearing that when his original image was shrunk down to card size, the ring wouldn't be visible at all. His new sketch brings the action closer to the ring itself.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. He opted to go with the close-in version, and it turned out beautifully.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
