What a matchup. This is the kind of head to head that makes watching Magic fun. Two genuinely outstanding players with great records, looking to advance to 8-1, both having won their opening match of the day. Both players are former World Champions. Mori defeated Frank Karsten on home soil in Yokohama 2005, while Mihara travelled to Paris a year later to claim the 2006 title with his Dragonstorm deck.


### Game 1


Mihara opened with [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), checking his hand before leaving the cards on top of his library. With [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) amongst the three, that was no surprise. [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) on turn two met with [Wring Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh) from Mori, who spent turn two looking at Mihara's hand with [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress). Mihara revealed [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate), [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound), [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control), and [Skywinder Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywinder+Drake). The 3/1 flyer hit the graveyard, with Mori casting a 3/1 of his own in [Bloodrage Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire). That didn't last long, Mihara using his [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) before attacking. He added [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear), and reloaded with [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination).

With Mori having just three [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s in play and no action, Mihara continued to press. A [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) allowed Mori to cast [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), but Mihara took the game up a notch with [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant). Mori got to five mana and cast [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh), which is a very good card. Mihara spent three mana, and cast [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath), and that turned out to be even better.


**Mori 0 - 1 Mihara**


### Game 2


Mori elected to draw at the start of game two, and he had the first action of the game on turn three with [Devouring Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Swarm). Mihara considered that enough of a threat to [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) it, spending his fourth turn drawing two cards with [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination). [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) from Mori fetched up [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), with Mihara laying [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant).


After Mori cast [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh), Mihara was ready with [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control).


When Mori cast his [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) the following turn, Mihara wasn't so ready...He traded his [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant) for the pair of 2/2 Zombies that had arrived with [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), and cast [Crown of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Empires), which would ensure that those Zombies wouldn't be replaced. Turns out he was kind of ready after all...

Mori cast [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress), seeing two [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound), [Turn to Frog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog), and [Skywinder Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywinder+Drake). Mori got rid of one of the [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound)s, before laying a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). What was his green splash? A second [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) saw him spend a little time choosing between two cards. He was torn between [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) and [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox). Which would he choose?


Mihara attacked with Mori's [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh), dropping [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) and leaving back enough mana to activate his [Crown of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Empires). [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) from Mori saw Mihara discard [Turn to Frog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) and [Skywinder Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywinder+Drake), both cards that Mori knew from the earlier [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress), leaving Mihara a lone card in hand, unknown to his opponent. In came the [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh) and [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) once more, with Mori taking a huge eight damage and falling to just three life. [Goblin Tunneler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Tunneler) joined the Mihara team, and Mori was in a really tough spot.


He drew for the turn. Mihara duly tapped the [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), and Mori scooped them up. Turn four [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), turn five [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh), turn six [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). Nowhere near enough.


**Katsuhiro Mori 0 - 2 Makihito Mihara**
