 Alexey Isupov's day started a little more than an hour ago thanks to his 2 Byes. The Russian was able to boost his confidence with a quick win, but he would now have to put in some extra work to maintain it; he got paired against Germany's Patrick Dickmann - one of the most accomplished players as of late. Dickmann has already amassed 39 Pro Points this season thanks to strong finishes at both the Grand Prix and the Pro Tour stage including an excellent third place at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*!






*Alexey Isupov now had to go up against Patrick Dickmann!*
