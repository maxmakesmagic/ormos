Sam Tharmaratnam is a Toronto PTQ fixture. He placed 50th at PT Paris this year, and then couldn't bring himself to foot the bill for Nagoya. San Francisco seems a lot more manageable. Both he and his opponent, Montreal's Ronald Be, have started off 4-0. Only one would remain undefeated.


Be won the die roll and chose to play. Tharmaratnam was first on the board with [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear). Be summoned a turn-two [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion). Tharmaratnam hit for two and played [Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus). Be returned fire and Tharmaratnam declined the trade. Be cast [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf).

Tharmaratnam hit for four and played [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper), stuck on just two lands. When Be swung in with his two creatures, Tharmaratnam was happy to trade the Lawkeepr for the [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf). Be simply played another. Tharmaratnam [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon)ed the Companion at end of turn, untapped, and hit for four. He still had no play.


Be suited up his Wolf with [Spirit Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Mantle) and attacked, bringing the life totals even at ten apiece. He replayed [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) and passed. Finally Tharmaratnam hit a third land. He dropped [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) on Garruks' Companion and attacked, leaving Be at six. Be evened things up and put out [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) to block. Tharmaratnam found land number four for [Assault Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), but that was just lunch for Be's next play of [Stingerfling Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingerfling+Spider). Two hits from the Wolf and the game was Be's.


Be 1 - Tharmaratnam 0


Tharmaratnam's turn-one [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear) was even better on the play, but he had no turn-two play to follow. Be played his [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion), but Tharmaratnam sent it home with Aether Adept, hitting for another two. Be killed the Bear with [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor). Tharmaratnam hit for two more with the Adept and played a [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk).


Be put the breaks on things with [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider). Tharmaratnam played his fifth land and passed. The Companion hit play again. Tharmaratnam Pacified the Spider and attacked. The Companion traded with the Aether Adept. Be summoned [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer), getting back his [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor). It quickly traded with [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk).

*Samuel Tharmaratnam* |


Tharmaratnam looked like he was out of gas. He could only summon a [Griffin [autocard]Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+%5Bautocard%5DSentinel)[/autocard] to his side. Be one-upped him with [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino). Tharmaratnam bought time with [Stonehorn Dignitary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehorn+Dignitary). Be simply boosted his offence with [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf) enchanted with the dreaded [Spirit Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Mantle).


The [Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel) flew overhead for one, and Tharmaratnam passed the turn. Be gave his Wolf [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) and swung in with it and the Rhino. Tharmaratnam double-blocked and played Mighty[Leap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leap), but mistakenly put it on his Dignitary, which was ordered second. It turned out not to matter, however. Be's Wolf continued to hit, and between [Stingerfling Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingerfling+Spider) and [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web), there was no way for Tharmaratnam to outrace it.
