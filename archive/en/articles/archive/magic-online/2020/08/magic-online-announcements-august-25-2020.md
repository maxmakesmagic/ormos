Supreme Draft: RAVNIXTRAVAGANZA
-------------------------------


[As announced yesterday](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/introducing-supreme-draft-2020-08-24), we're running a series of Draft events in a new format dubbed Supreme Draft, the first of which begins tomorrow, August 26, and ends September 2. We're kicking off this first week with RAVNIXTRAVAGANZA, featuring a cluster of the eight sets from Ravnica that feature the guilds (so that's *Ravnica: City of Guilds*, *Guildpact*, *Dissension*, *Return to Ravnica*, *Gatecrash*, *Dragon's Maze*, *Guilds of Ravnica*, and *Ravnica Allegiance*).


You'll get two or three packs from each of those guild sets, then draft your very Ravnica deck. Entry options include 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points, and events are Phantom.


For more information on Supreme Draft and how it works, please check out the announcement article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/introducing-supreme-draft-2020-08-24).

Showcase Qualifier Weekend
--------------------------


Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the Champions Showcase. The entry fee for Showcase Qualifiers is a format token that matches the format of the Showcase. As with QPs, after the season's Showcase Qualifiers are finished, all unused Format Tokens will be removed from players' accounts. Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and an upcoming Premier Event invitation.


Showcase Qualifiers are scheduled as follows:





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **EVENT** | **FORMAT** | **INVITATION** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saturday, August 29, 2020 | 8:00 a.m. | Modern Showcase Qualifier | Modern | Season 2 Showcase |
| Sunday, August 30, 2020 | 8:00 a.m. | Legacy Showcase Qualifier | Legacy | Season 2 Showcase |
