Bonnie Bruenderman is a visual designer for DailyMTG. The authors write the articles; the editors edit; then she gets to add cards, images, funnies, charts, graphs... whatever the article needs above and beyond the text. She has a very nerdy sense of humor. (Someday, her illustrated mutant amalgamations shall take over the Multiverse! Patience, my pet. Patience.....) 






"Call me Fblthp one more time. Just once more....."

Whoa! Calm down little buddy! I'll explain it to them....

  
 Hey all! Thought I should clear something up. You know that homunculus depicted on [Provoke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382336), the *Conspiracy* reprint? That isn't Fblthp. Fblthp lives on Ravnica, and while this card doesn't have a designated plane, he's different enough, with those meaty hams, that it's obvious they're not the same homunculus. He probably has a name, but no one has told me what it is, so I just call him Kevin. He doesn't seem to mind. I mean, at least it's pronounceable. 

Now that we have that cleared up, let's check out the art! It's a bit hard to tell at card size, but taking a look at the larger art we see that is mud on his face. I don't think throwing that was a very good idea, and whomever is on the other end of his fists in a few moments will probably agree with me.

We have a fun sketch with this one, so click through to see the sketch, the sketch overlaying the art for comparison, then the final art. Enjoy!
