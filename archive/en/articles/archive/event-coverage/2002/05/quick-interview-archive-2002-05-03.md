**"What is the best deck in Standard right now?"**



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Jeff Fung:** "Battle of Wits, I went 4-3 with it when I played Regionals for fun." | **Kamiel Cornelissen:** "G/U/R, but I don't really know, because I haven't played any games with it." | **Jon Finkel:** "Psychatog." |

**"Wild Mongrel or Cephalid Looter?"**



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Svend Geertsen:** "Both? I think I would take Mongrel at a good table, because everybody likes blue." | **Eric Taylor:** "Looter. Looter by himself can win the game." | **Nicolai Herzog:** "Mongrel. It is just a stronger card, Looter is too easily dealt with." |

**"Who would you like to do a comeback on the Pro Tour?"**



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Tomi Walamies:** "Lan D. Ho, I like the guy." | **Jeff Cunningham:** "Brian Hacker, he is on my team for the Team Pro Tour, and that would be a good time for a comeback." | **Rob Dougherty:** "Shawn "Hammer" Regnier. He is a New England Hero and a bunch of people really like him. Besides, he is one of the original celebrities of Magic." |

**"What is your favorite event location ever?"**



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Jeff Cunningham:** "Barcelona, it was just really fun." | **Tomi Walamies:** "Helsinki, I live there and I like the place." | **Olivier Ruel:** "Prague. It is a really nice city, and the site was great with a great view." |

**"Who is the most underrated player on the Pro Tour?"**



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Pierre Malherbaud:** "Karim Aouidad, he will be in the Pro Tour at least in Boston." | **Noah Boeken:** "Brock Parker, he is very good but can't win." | **Ken Ho:** "Who rates people?" |

**"What is the best card in *Odyssey/Torment*?"**



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Olivier Ruel:** "Call of the Herd, because you can play it in any deck." | **Katsuhiro Mori:** "Psychatog. Read the text!" | **Jens Thoren:** "Faceless Butcher, it is simply the best creature." |

**"What do you think about Zvi's gambit?"**



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Rob Dougherty:** "It is fine for players to do, but in a couple of Pro Tours, one third of the players will be wearing that, or at least enough people to look really dumb. I think the judges should treat this like signalling in drafts." | **Tomi Walamies:** "I think that it is an ugly t-shirt." | **Jelger Wiegersma:** "I think white is a terrible colour, so I don't think it will pay off." |
