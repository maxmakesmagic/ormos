### Invitations and Eligibility

Players may have earned invitations through performance at a previous Pro Tour, Player's Club membership level, winning a previous Qualifier or Grand Prix tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official ratings invitation announcement for the appropriate Pro Tour).


### Prizes


 


* The winning player of each Pro Tour—Hollywood Qualifier tournament in Japan will receive an invitation to the Pro Tour and a round-trip air ticket from his/her closest airport to Hollywood. (The deadline for applying for the travel award is April 23, 2008.)
* Product prizes to be determined by the organizer.
* The Pro Tour—Hollywood Qualifiers will also feature a special Amateur prize schedule. The Amateur prizes will be awarded to the highest-finishing amateur players *in addition to any other prizes those players receive from the main tournament prize schedule* . The highest-finishing amateur players will receive additional booster packs as follows.  
**Amateur Award Prize Schedule**

| 2nd | 8 packs |
