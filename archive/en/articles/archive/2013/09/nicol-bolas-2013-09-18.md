NICOL BOLAS
===========



 Posted in [ARTICLES](/en/articles)

Elder dragon and tyrant of worlds, Nicol Bolas is one of the oldest known beings in the Multiverse.


Mana hungry and wielding a triple threat of blue, black, and red spells, he’s a force of villainous destruction, crushing all magic—and minds—that stand in his way.


Witness to countless wars, cataclysms, and rivalries, Bolas is one of only five elder dragons to survive the Dragon War. He’s also survived the destruction of his Madaran Empire on Dominaria at the hands of Tetsuo Umezawa, the epic duels between the Planeswalkers Leshrac and Teferi, and The Mending, which healed the universe and consequently changed the very nature of the Planeswalker spark, costing several Planeswalkers their lives.


Nicol Bolas left a crumbling Dominaria before The Mending, implying that it couldn't be saved. "I have prepared a suitable place for myself in that eventuality," he said before departing through the Talon Gates.


In fact, he had already begun plotting his next scheme for power. His “suitable place” was Alara, which Bolas had been watching for decades. Long ago, he began recruiting agents on Alara’s five shards—gathering individuals and groups who could secretly do his bidding. These agents have sown the seeds of dissent, creating chaos and conflict. Unknown to all but Nicol, the shards of Alara are reconverging into a single plane, and when that happens, he wants all-out planar war.


Why? His obsessive need to regain the godlike powers he had before The Mending. Back then, Planeswalkers were ageless shapeshifters whose supremacy was limited only by their experience and knowledge.


This elder dragon had that power torn away from him, and he will go to any lengths to get it back. For Nicol Bolas, all the power in the universe is not enough.
