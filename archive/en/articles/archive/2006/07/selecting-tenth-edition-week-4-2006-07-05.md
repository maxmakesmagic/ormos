It's a big week on Selecting *Tenth Edition*. The contentious green creature vote is in, and this week also marks the beginning of the artist sketch competitions, plus the third block for basic land art. Let's roll!


[Last Week's](/en/articles/archive/selecting-tenth-edition-week-3-2006-06-28) card vs. card vote inspired some passionate support for all three beefy beaters on the boards. In the end, it was the Troll that emerged from the fight still standing, collecting more votes than the other two cards combined and plenty more!

**Troll Ascetic makes it to *Tenth Edition*!**


|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Troll Ascetic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) | 6889 | 60.7% |

| [Erhnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn) | 1521 | 13.4% |
| **Totals** | **11353** | **100%** |

*Comments from Matt Place*



> 
> For me the most interesting point in the [Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer) versus [Empyrial Plate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Plate) choice is their effect on Limited. While [Empyrial Plate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Plate) is a fine card in any Limited deck, the Warhammer is a bomb that you almost never lose with if it is in play. Is that ok? There are many rare cards in **Magic** that are just as powerful in Limited. Visara and Rorix are good examples. The difference is that those last two cards also had a decent amount of constructed play while the Warhammer was most commonly seen bashing someoneâ€™s head only in Limited.
> 
> 
> Even though [Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer) did see some constructed play, I would rather see the top limited bomb in *10th Edition* have more application in Standard, so my pick is [Empyrial Plate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Plate).

*Comments from Aaron Forsythe*



> 
> I will concede that [Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro) was, at one time, a very popular, reasonably powerful and well-played card. I will also concede that [Empyrial Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Armor) was a defining card in *Weatherlight* and showed up in tournament-winning decks. But [Empyrial Plate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Plate) just wasn't that kind of card. It came and went, and no one noticed.
> 
> 
> [Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer), however, is a uniquely awesome card. Everyone's jaws dropped the first time they saw this thing, and it continues to make people happy to this day in *Ninth Edition*. It does everything you could possibly want from an equipment--gives trample, gives a mighty power bonus, and gains tons of life.
> 
> 
> And with [Troll Ascetic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) making his triumphant return in *Tenth Edition*, you have one of the juiciest possible targets for the Warhammer already in place! 6/2 trampling, regenerating, spirit linked, untargetable beater? Sounds like a dream come true!

### Artist Sketch Vote #1


The first sketches are in! This week you'll be choosing your favorite sketch for [Lord of the Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit). The artist's sketch that gets the most votes will be developed into the final piece for *Tenth Edition's* version of [Lord of the Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit). For this one, you'll be choosing between Mike Sutfin and Dave Allsop. As a new twist, we're not going to tell you which artist illustrated which sketch for Selecting *Tenth Edition*, so you'll have to go strictly by which sketch you prefer.
