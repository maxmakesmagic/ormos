Miracle-Gro Taking Over

*Alan Comer's Miracle-Gro deck has made quite an impression*
It started at Vegas. Madman Alan Comer debuted a deck whose lineage extends to his own TurboXerox. Dubbed Miracle-Gro because of the supercharging interaction of blue cantrips and Quirion Dryad, it took the tournament by storm. However, the smallest fraction of tiebreakers kept Comer out of the Top 8, and so the deck was not shouted from the rooftops.


A week later, Mike Long appeared at Grand Prix - Sendai. He'd taken a liking to Miracle-Gro, but stripped it of its Merfolk creature base in favor of Werebears and Wild Mongrels. He smashed his way through the field only to meet a nightmare matchup in the semifinals. 


Suddenly, it was everywhere. Reports out of Germany had it winning every qualifier in sight. They seemed to argue over all but the base of the deck: 10 land, Land Grants, Cantrips, Quirion Dryad. Did the Mongrels belong? Did Curiosity? How many Winter Orbs? It didn't seem to matter. The deck was taking names.


This weekend Miracle-Gro is out in force. Of the two hundred seventy-two players in Day 1, fifty-two were playing Miracle-Gro. Nineteen percent of the field is significant. Expect that figure to grow for Day 2.


It doesn't end there. In amongst the endless tech and minor variations, there is a cadre of thinkers who have anticipated the Miracle-Gro metagame, and have gone one better. Dubbed "Super Gro", this new version adds white for Mystic Enforcer and Swords to Plowshares, aiming to rule the "mirror". To accommodate the extra color, the deck now runs upwards of fourteen lands.

*Mystic Enforcer has snuck into some decklists*
At least six of its proponents advanced to Day 2, and between them there were only four losses. 


7-0-0 Ben Rubin  

6-0-1 Chris Benafel  

6-1-0 Brian Kibler  

5-1-1 Lan D. Ho (actually a win, but he ID'd with lethal damage on the stack, because he's that kind of a guy)  

5-1-1 Dan O'Mahoney-Schwartz  

5-1-1 Phil Freneau


Subtracting the byes, that makes 20-4-4. Not too shabby. That kind of representation probably makes William Jensen and his Anti-Miracle-Gro deck an odds-on favorite to take the prize.
