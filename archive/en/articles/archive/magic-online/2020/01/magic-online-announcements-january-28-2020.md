*Ravnica* Block Flashback Draft
-------------------------------


No *Return to*, no *Guilds of*. This is the *City of Guilds*, my friends, and the *Guildpact* and *Dissension* that followed. Starting tomorrow, January 29, you can draft those [Selesnya Evangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Evangel)s and, I guess, other cards if you want to. There's certainly no shortage of classic cards in this block.


In addition to the standard entry options of 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points, you can also enter this event with 2 Event Tickets plus 2 boosters of a single set within the block. This event is Phantomâ€”the cards you draft will not be added to your collection.
