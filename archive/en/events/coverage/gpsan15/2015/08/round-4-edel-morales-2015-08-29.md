The first feature match of GP Santiago faced off new *Magic*Hall of Famer inductee Willy Edel, with four Pro Tour Top 8s under his sleeve, against Nicolas Morales, a local player. Edel made the first move by placing an ‘I played against a Magic the Gathering Hall of Famer” badge on Morales’ playmat.


**Game 1**


Edel won the roll and elected to play first. He dropped an early, aggressive, [Abbot of Keral Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbot+of+Keral+Keep), exiling a Plains to no effect. Morales opened with a [Leaf Gilder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Gilder) in response. Edel began the race with a [Call of the Full Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Full+Moon) on his Abbot, pushing the aggressive start further.


Morales ramped into a [Rhox Maulers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Maulers) that traded with the Abbot, followed by a [Vastwood Gorger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vastwood+Gorger). Edel, in contrast, trapped on three mountains, struggled to contain the giant wurm, which slowly but surely devoured his life total.

**Game 2**


Edel elected to go first again, but kept a very slow hand, his first play a [War Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Oracle) on Turn 4, not the aggressive start he wanted against Morales’ giant creatures. Morales first creature was also a four-drop, [Guardian Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+Automaton).


Edel turned his [War Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Oracle) into a lycanthrope with another [Call of the Full Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Full+Moon) and started beating his opponent down. Morales found a [Unholy Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Hunger) to kill the [War Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Oracle), then backed his board up with a [Rhox Maulers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Maulers).


Edel, with only a [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade), needed a way past the two bigger creatures. He found it with a combination of [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) on the [Guardian Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardian+Automaton), which was then sacrificed to [Fiery Conclusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Conclusion) on the Rhox Mauler, allowing the [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) to get in and become renowned.


Morales quickly recovered with a [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) and a [Deadbridge Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadbridge+Shaman), slowing Edel right down. These were followed by a [Vastwood Gorger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vastwood+Gorger). With little to do, Edel fired off a [Chandra's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Fury), killing the [Deadbridge Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadbridge+Shaman) and putting Morales on a perilously low life total.


Edel tempted Morales to sacrifice his wurm to the Nantuko Huskm, in response to a second [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason), but Morales didn’t take the bait, instead blocking the [Vastwood Gorger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vastwood+Gorger) with his Husk, protecting his life total and saving the wurm.


Morales cast a [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts), using the wurm to kill the renowned warrior, which put Edel well behind with nothing on the board. Edel attempted to recover with a [Subterranean Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Scout), but the lowly 2/1 was no match for the massive monsters slowly accumulating under Morales. A few turns later Edel was dead.


**Edel 0 - Morales 2**
