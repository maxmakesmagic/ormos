MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES ELIGIBILITY


* All Magic Online players who meet the eligibility requirements set forth herein are eligible to compete in this online tournament series. All Magic Online players are eligible to compete in the 2013 Magic Online Championship Series except (a) players who are otherwise ineligible to engage in tournament play pursuant to the [Magic Online User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358) and (b) employees or contractors of Wizards of the Coast LLC (“Wizards”), Hasbro or each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or their advertising or promotion agencies, or those who are domiciled with any such person, or those who have been disqualified for other reasons (see below). This is a skill-based tournament based on a player's ability to defeat other players.
* Players may be disqualified if they are suspended from Magic Online for any reason, including without limitation a violation of the [Magic Online User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358).
* Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for a Season Preliminary, a Season Finals, or the Player of the Year Championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in any Season Preliminary, Season Finals, Last Chance Qualifier, or Championship event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [Magic Online User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). If you play in Magic Online tournaments, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established.
* Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to reschedule and/or restart tournaments, matches, and/or games as needed. Such decisions will be announced on the Magic Online website and/or within the Magic Online client as needed.
* To be eligible to participate in the Magic Online Championship Series, the following requirements must be met:
	+ All Magic Online players must be at least 13 or older. A championship player between the ages of 13 and 18 will be required to get a parent or guardian's signature on the required waiver and consent forms as explained below.
	+ Players must have Internet access.
	+ Players must have access to a personal computer.
	+ Players must be Magic Online account holders in good standing and in compliance with the [Magic Online User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358).

 


2013 MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES STRUCTURE   



* Seasons: The 2013 Magic Online Championship Series will be divided into twelve (12) separate seasons. Each season's duration is four (4) weeks. Each season's start and end date are listed in the schedule below. Each MOCS season begins after the scheduled maintenance on its Start Date and ends at the beginning of the scheduled maintenance on its End Date. If for any reason there is no scheduled maintenance on those dates, the start and stop time will be 8:00 AM PST (or PDT when appropriate).
* Qualifier Points: During each season, a number of Magic Online events will offer the opportunity to earn Qualifier Points (QPs). These MOCS qualifying events are restricted to scheduled events and queues that have successfully completed with at least eight (8) players and include Qualifier Points (QPs) listed as part of their prize structure. The number of Qualifier Points (QPs) offered will vary by event. Points earned in a season do not carry over to any other season. See the table below for more information about Qualifier Points (QPs).
* Earning Qualifier Points (QPs): At the end of each specified tournament, all participants may earn Qualifier Points (QPs) based upon their final rank or points standing in the tournament. Qualifier Points (QPs) earned in any given season are season specific and cannot be used to join another season's Preliminaries or Finals.
* Season Preliminaries: At the end of each season, Magic Online will offer up to four (4) Season Preliminaries. All eligible players who have earned sufficient QPs may join and participate in any of the corresponding Season Preliminaries. Players who finish with enough Match Wins will earn enough QPs to join the corresponding Season Finals.
* Season Finals: At the end of each season, after all of the Season Preliminaries have completed, all eligible players who have earned sufficient QPs may join and participate in the corresponding Season Finals. The winner of each Season Finals will earn an invitation to participate in the 2013 Magic Online Championship to be held in 2014 and an invitation to participate in a Pro Tour\* aligned with their season win. (see 2013 Magic Online Championship Series Schedule below).
* Player of the Year: Wizards of the Coast will track the cumulative Qualifier Points (QPs) of each player and maintain the following [Player of the Year leaderboards](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mol/poy): Constructed and Limited. After the end of the twelfth season, players who are ranked in the top 150 of each leaderboard will be invited to play in the 2013 Magic Online Player of the Year Championship tournament held on December 14, 2013. The winner of the Player of the Year Championship will be invited to participate in the 2013 Magic Online Championship and an invitation to participate in a Pro Tour\* aligned with their win.

Different tournaments or formats may be called out and offer increased or reduced amounts of QPs each season. This adjusted QP schedule will be announced a minimum of one week prior to the start of a season.


In addition, Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to add/remove qualifying formats, alter events that award Qualifier Points (QPs), and/or adjust the number of QPs offered by any event with a minimum of 24 hours notice.


Note: Some tournaments that are part of the MOCS (such as Season Finals) do not award QPs.


SEASON PRELIMINARIES AND SEASON FINALS PARTICIPATION   



All players who qualify for the Season Preliminaries or Season Finals will automatically receive a copy of that season's promo card awarded to their qualifying account during the scheduled maintenance period prior to the Season Preliminaries. If for any reason there is no scheduled maintenance on that date, the promo card will be awarded during the next scheduled maintenance period.


Qualifier Points are season specific and can only be used for the season in which they are earned. QPs earned in previous season cannot used to enter or applied towards later Season Preliminaries or Season Finals. Qualifier Points are not tradable and are for the sole use of the player who has earned them. Unused QPs in each player's collection will be removed at the conclusion of the 2013 Magic Online Championship Series.


It is the player's responsibility to verify that they have the correct number of QPs required to enter and join the Season Preliminaries and/or Season Finals PRIOR to its start time. If a player believes he or she should be qualified and is unable to join the Season Preliminaries or Season Finals, they will need to contact customer service prior to the start of the event.
