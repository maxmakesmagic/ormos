Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:askwizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive, but if your question is good, it might show up in the coming weeks! 

**Q:** What was your favorite moment from this weekend's Pro Tour?


**A:** From **Trick Jarrett**, Editor in Chief for **DailyMTG.com**


I was in Barcelona as part of the coverage team, but I didn't want to be the one to answer it. So I turned to a selection of my coverage team.


Josh Bennett said, "As a Canadian, I did my best to remain impartial during the finals of the event, but once it was finished I was able to unleash my Canadian pride and fully luxuriate in the Canadian Alexander Hayne's victory. I loved his winning and I loved the sight of him being mobbed by his entire Canadian team."


Nate Price responded, "The Canadian team singing their horribly off key rendition of *Hallelujah.* But closely following that is an interaction I had with Shimizu during the main event when he was paired against Finkel. He was visibly excited and when I inquired, he responded that he could not wait to play Jon Finkel; he had 'only seen him in magazine.'"


Mike R. told me, "Every single one of Hayne's draw steps. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the Top 8."


You might have noticed a trend among responses, but there's a few more.


Nick Fang, our event statistician: "I loved the fact that we got to see the drama of Hayne's deck fail in the fourth game of the finals. The fact he could have won had he played with perfect knowledge, but didn't and was punished for playing the safe plays. And then to see it win in dramatic and over-the-top fashion for Game 5."


Greg Collins, head of all coverage: "I loved debuting the new broadcast booth and news room, and the fact that it was received so very well."


Mine? Well, I'm just going to have to cop out and look back over the weekend and enjoy it all. As corny as it sounds I just enjoyed the whole event.
