Playing for the Top 8 of any Pro Tour is a tough position only a privileged few have earned. Every event the best players, rising stars, and breakout players collide in a clump at the top of the standings, vying for the right to return for the Sunday stage.



**The Players**




 Jackson Cunningham was one of those players. Attending Pro Tour *Magic* 2015 from a Pro Tour Qualifier as his very first Pro Tour, playing for Top 8 might have seemed unlikely a day before. Now, he carried the title of King of the Hill and could have taken a draw for a likely place in the Top 8.




 "You don't want to draw?" It wasn't a typical question to hear at the last round of a Pro Tour. Jackson Cunningham asked it innocently, because his opponent was ready to play.




 "No, I don't." Patrick Cox shared a definitive answer, looking to not just find his second Pro Tour Top 8 but to secure top seeding within it. Passing his previous goal or earning point for the Pro Players Club, Cox had set his sights on one of the most elusive achievements in *Magic*: winning a Pro Tour.






*Patrick Cox's Top 8 slot may have been locked up, but he was intent to win the whole thing. That meant giving himself the best edge possible on Sunday. He needed the ability to choose to play with his deck.*
