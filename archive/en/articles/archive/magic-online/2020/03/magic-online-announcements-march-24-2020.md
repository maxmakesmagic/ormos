*Magic Online* Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------


As part of our initiatives to give you [more ways to play at home](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/FNM_at_Home), we wanted to provide options for you to play at the highest levels for competitive stakes. Therefore, in light of the [changes to the tabletop Players Tour Qualifiers announced earlier](https://magic.gg/news/changes-to-qualifiers-for-players-tour-series-2-events-and-schedule), we're adding a new series of qualifiers to [*Magic Online*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/what-magic-online-magic-online-products-game-info) to provide additional ways for players to compete and qualify for upcoming Players Tour events: *Magic Online* Super Qualifiers. These online events will run alongside existing *Magic Online* Qualifiers and will continue to invite players to Players Tour Series 2 events.


And in order to make the Super Qualifiers as exciting as possible, we've added more prizes! Players who earn 65th place through 128th place will receive 100 Play Points. These prizes are in addition to those previously announced. And, because we intend this to be a quality of the Super Qualifier events as a whole, we're *retroactively adding these* to events that have already concluded! Players who earned these prizes will have them granted before the end of this week.


Get event info [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020#sq), read more about MTGO Super Qualifiers [here](https://magic.gg/news/announcing-magic-online-super-qualifiers), or check out the schedule below:

*Vintage Cube* Until April 1
----------------------------


You asked, and we responded (or, rather, [we asked](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline/status/1238221299727491072), and you responded)! With some of us having some extra at-home time to fill, the *Vintage Cube* is back for two weeks starting tomorrow and running until April 1. This encore presentation is the same cube we ran back in December and January, so we don't have a change list to publish.


To make room for the *Vintage Cube*, we've moved the *Invasion* Block Flashback Draft to April 29, added *Modern Horizons* Draft for a week starting April 1, and delayed the start of the *Modern Cube* to April 8. We're aware that some *Invasion* Block fans may be disappointed by the change, so we'll explore some ways to spice up the event when it does launch.


Thanks, and good luck in your leagues.

*Modern Horizons* Draft April 1

Build Notes
-----------


General | Numerous updates and improvements have been made to sounds across the client.


Home Scene | The splash image has been replaced by a carousel that can display several images.


Duel Scene | [Custodi Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Custodi+Lich) will once again trigger correctly on the turn it enters the battlefield if another player was already the monarch before it entered the battlefield.


Sideboarding | If a player submits a deck to an event without having all sideboard cards in their collection, but they have other versions of those cards instead, those other versions will be added to the deck for that event.
