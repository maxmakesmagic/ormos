GRAND PRIX LILLE 2016
=====================




Welcome to Grand Prix Lille. Day one is over and 1,818 players have been whittled down to 538. Another day of sweltering hot Modern action awaits us to determine who will be crowned champion of Grand Prix Lille 2016.
















GRAND PRIX LILLE 2016
---------------------




* [Day 1 Coverage](#tabs-0)


Day 1 Coverage



1,818 players showed up at Grand Prix Lille on a sweltering hot day to do battle with their Modern decks. The predictions were for a field favoring aggressive decks and for Jund to do well. However, with a card pool as large as Modern to choose from it was inevitable that the field would end up being much more varied.


After nine hard-fought rounds six players ended the day with perfect 9-0 records at the top of the standings. Thomas Hendriks, Thomas van der Paelt, Michael Bonde, Manuel Menges, Alessandro Casamenti, and Mike Boulinguiez (pictured above, left to right, with Boulinguiez in front) were the players ending the day in pole position, and fittingly they managed it all playing different decks. Death’s Shadow Aggro, Elves, Jund, Affinity, Ad Nauseum and Through the Breach Scapeshift… which is the top dog of Modern? Come back tomorrow as the 538 players with a 6-3 record or better return to fight through another six rounds and attempt to earn themselves a Top 8 berth and a chance at a coveted Grand Prix title.


And this is not the only Modern action. If you want more, check out the concurrent coverage at Grand Prix Guangzhou and Grand Prix Indianapolis.
