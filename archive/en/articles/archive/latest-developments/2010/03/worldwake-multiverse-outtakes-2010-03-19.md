Worldwake Multiverse Outtakes

Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now. 







There is a storied tradition of Latest Developments authors using comments from Multiverse, the internal working database that we use to piece together **Magic** sets, as a window into **Magic** design and development. Somehow, I haven't managed to do much of that since *Worldwake* preview season. Today, I will make up for lost time and show you as many *Worldwake* Multiverse comments as I can squeeze into one article. I've done my best to choose bits that are as amusing as possible, but I'm sure we'll learn something practical along the way too.


The following is a key to the people you're about to read comments from.

You may recall Jumping Giant from such articles as [Making Landfall, Part I](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/making-landfall-part-i-2009-09-25). When we got final art in, though, Ken was overcome by pathos.

I'm a sucker for creeping tragedy in art, so I smiled to myself when I read Ken's comment. I don't know what that says about me.

At the time I made my comment, the art description suggested that the two allies might be of two different races, perhaps one kor and one human. This would have been confusing with cards like [Kor Outfitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Outfitter)—which token is which?—so it was changed to two Humans instead, and ultimately it was decided that the race of the Soldier Allies it created wasn't important enough to specify on the card.


Note that I could have checked the revision history to learn the mysterious identity of CostBenefitBot, but I think it's more fun to not know.

Goofy little tricks like this are one of the things that make limited formats fun to play over and over again. This is even trickier than most limited tricks; not only can it win you creature fights that were already happening, but it can also cause a fight that your opponent didn't know could happen. Our resident political multiplayer guru, however, wasn't satisfied with this, and demanded even more trickiness!

Ken loves cards that let him get involved in combat steps that didn't otherwise involve him. Now, this card lets you give a friend a surprise blocker-or punish an enemy with one!

It's a little bizarre that we only came to this card's rescue after it was saved by someone else, but comment storms like this tell designers and developers which cards are loved. That's good data to have no matter when it is recieved.

Once again, Ken is there with the multiplayer save.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ld/ld82_07carda.jpg)The first version of [Vapor Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snare) essentially had "Enchant creature with power less or equal to the number of [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s you control", which is easy to write in English but cannot be written elegantly in **Magic**-ese without rules interactions we deemed undesirable. I suggested stealing [Living Tsunami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Tsunami)'s line of text, which was added to the file (with one difference, which we’ll get to). That inspired these comments:

Designers don't always think along the same axes as developers do, and it's great to get their feedback even long after the design handoff. Kelly Digges was on the *Worldwake* design team, and pointed out that he thought something was missing.

Other than the fact that I get to make **Magic** cards, my favorite thing about my job is how much everyone who works on **Magic** cares about it. We all love our game, and want the best for it. Without input from so many passionate people, including those outside of R&D, we could never make **Magic** as great as we do. In this case, Kelly's obligation to *Worldwake* had long since ended, but he still stopped in to check on the file. Because of that, we made the set better. Thanks, Kelly!

Let's take a break for some technical rules discussion. I cast a [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear). You cast a [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) targeting my [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear). I respond with [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap) targeting your [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel). When my [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap) resolves, I change the target of [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) to [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap), which—because it is still resolving—is still on the stack and therefore a legal target of [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel). Once this target is changed, [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap) goes to the graveyard. When the [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) tries to resolve, it discovers that its target, [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap), is gone, so the game counters the [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel). Then, my [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) enters the battlefield. Effectively, I have just used [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap) to counter your [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel).


Note that I can't have the [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) target itself; I have to have it target the [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap). This is because a [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) found in nature cannot be cast targeting itself; targets for a spell are chosen before that spell goes on the stack, so the [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) cannot see itself while you choose its target. Therefore, a spell on the stack is not a legal target for itself.



Did you know all of this? My guess is that I have readers who didn't, and it doesn't speak ill of you if you are one of them. This interaction is legitimately weird. **Magic** editor Del Laugel, however, came up with reminder text that is both hilarious and short to try to address this problem.



> 
> Del 5/1: (CARDNAME is a spell.) :)  
> 
>  TML 5/7/2009: I love it :D
> 
> 
> 


This was Del's humorous way of prompting players to move the [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) to the [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap). There are so many other uses for [Ricochet Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap), however, that printing this reminder text would not have been worth it.

> 
> KD 2/3: I like this card because it addresses an obvious thought while playing the set: "If I can just draw three lands in a row, I win!" Maybe a [Weird Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weird+Harvest) type card (like... [Weird Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weird+Harvest)?) would address that better.

Ken's design playtest names are always fantastic, and usually connect to the mechanics in amusing ways. I wish I remember what Traveling Salesman Problem did.


Some time later, I noticed that the art concept described Jace.

>  KEN 2/27/2009: This is a Johnny break-me goofy rare. Putting Jace in the art could be dangerous negative publicity. We should contact his agent. Apparently, he was willing to compromise when we told him that he would get his own new planeswalker card in the same set.

This is a brilliant design from Ken. It doesn't conform to the same cost reduction template as all the other Traps. We don't normally let things like that go, but I think we all just adored this card so much that we didn't care.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ld/ld82_12carda.jpg)One of Del's jobs as an editor is to hammer on templates by finding strange corner cases that cause strange things to happen. Sometimes this causes us to change cards, but other times we decide that the interaction is awesome and allow it. Here is an example of the latter.



> 
> Del 4/13: Mandatory gives me the dream of playing [Gather Specimens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Specimens) while my opponent has this in play and then swinging with everybody. :) Okay?

> 
>  KD 4/30: Del: Good thinking. I can't wait until that happens. :D

This was followed by a bonus observation from Aaron.

I'm glad we decided to go with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif), both for Aaron's reason and because it has already saved me tons of clicks on **Magic Online** even though *Worldwake* has only been out there for a few weeks! This changes how the card interacts with things like [Rosheen Meanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rosheen+Meanderer) and [Ceaseless Searblades](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ceaseless+Searblades), but more importantly, it makes the card play better under ordinary circumstances.
