This was a rematch of round six, where they had played each other for the honor of going undefeated through day one. In that game, Antoine had topdecked his second [Dirge of Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirge+of+Dread) to kill Olivier, so Ruel was out for revenge here. His Wake deck should have quite a good chance against Antoine's blue-green madness deck.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natfra03/a944.jpg)Olivier's version of Wake is a little different in that he has Angel's maindeck, which s becoming more standard, as well as more countermagic. Antoine played a second turn [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), which Olivier countered. Menard then played an [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) which resolved. He used it to drop a [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) into play.

Olivier made a fairly unmysterious morph, but Antoine just unsummoned it and madnessed out an [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) at the end of turn. His next attack dropped Olivier to seven, so he [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)ed for a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to buy a little more time.

He didn't need to use the [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) straight away, as he drew [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) which let him force through a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). This left Antoine with nothing to do but [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) the replayed [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel). Ruel made a second one, and with two [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace)s in hand there was nothing Antoine could do.

Olivier Ruel 1 – Antoine Menard 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natfra03/a943.jpg)Olivier has an interesting sideboard with four [Chastise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chastise). He brought all of these in and took out [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake)s and [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari)s, which are next to useless in this matchup anyway.

Antoine cursed under his breath as he drew an opening hand with no lands, and mulliganed into a landless six card hand. The game was all but over before it began as there were no land in his five card hand either. The four card hand was [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop), [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), and was also thrown back. "Please mention that I only cut his deck," Olivier joked.

Antoine finally found a three card hand of two lands, [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) which he kept, and made the Looter on turn two. Oliver made a morph on turn three, unmorphed on the next turn, and fairly unsurprisingly, Antoine wasn't able to put up much of a fight with his three card hand.

**Final Result:** Olivier Ruel 2 – Antoine Menard 0
