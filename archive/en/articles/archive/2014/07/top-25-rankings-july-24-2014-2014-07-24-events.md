The waiting is almost over, as we head toward the final three events of the *Magic* season. As we do so, let's take one more look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Locked in battle at the top of the standings, as they now seem certain to be in Portland next week, Jérémy Dezani and Reid Duke have both put together stellar seasons. Only one can emerge as Player of the Year, however, and one of the most important questions of the next seven days is whether Reid will attend Grand Prix Boston-Worcester in a bid to get ahead of Dezani. The Frenchman is already Stateside, having travelled with fellow [Pro Tour](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptths13/welcome) *[Theros](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptths13/welcome)*finalist Pierre Dagen. Frankly, for Europeans already en route to the Pro Tour, making a stop to play Modern this weekend makes a fair amount of sense.



For a lot of the homegrown pros, however, a four-day there-and-back ride across the country represents a huge chunk taken out of Pro Tour testing time, and Portland really isn't the time to go in underprepared. A similar decision awaits the Asian members of the pro fraternity. Lee Shi Tian is delaying his departure for the PT in order to compete at Grand Prix Chinese Taipei this weekend, and we have to imagine a bunch of [MTG Mintcard](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/team-mtgmintcard) teammates doing the same thing. Will jetlag play a part in Portland?



In any case, Taipei and Boston-Worcester will be the penultimate chapter in our rankings story for this season. What will the top of the table look like heading into Pro Tour *Magic 2015*? Join us right here next week to find out.
