**Dave Guskin:** My favorite new mechanic from *Scars of Mirrodin* is proliferate!

It's clearly powerful in combination with the -1/-1 counter theme prevalent in the set, and gives you a subtle spell-based way to increase the poison counters on your opponents—I've often thought of my Contagion Clasp sitting innocuously on the battlefield as a new-age Rod of Ruin. You'll also be surprised to find—as I was a few Sealed Deck games around the office, and as PT–Amsterdam finalist Brad Nelson was while playing *Elspeth vs. Tezzeret* at the Champion Challenge—the sheer effect a single proliferate can have on the battlefield. My personal best was seven permanents in *Scars* Limited: two artifacts with charge counters, four of my opponent's creatures with -1/-1 counters on them, and my planeswalker's loyalty counters.


But really, with the openness available to proliferate, the sky's the limit. I've had fun proliferating quest counters, +1/+1 counters, and level counters in Standard. I'm looking forward to making some decks where I can proliferate fade counters, storage counters, and maybe even omen and ki counters! While many of the mechanics in *Scars of Mirrodin* are fairly linear, proliferate is so modular that the possibilities can be almost daunting ... my favorite kind of mechanic!
