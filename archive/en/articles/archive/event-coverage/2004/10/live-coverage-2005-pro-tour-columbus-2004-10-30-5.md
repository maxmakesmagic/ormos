Before joining Magic Online as its digital product manager, Mike worked as a producer for Wizards's technology department, a product manager for organized play, and as an R&D lead developer. He has played Magic Online since it came out in 2002 and Magic since The Dark. 






Both players came into the match at 8-1 with six rounds left to play. Masashi Oiso brought a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) deck that splashes black for [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) and [Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night)scape Familiar. After sideboarding, he has the ability to bring in [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) although that seems unlikely in this matchup. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcol05/fm10_1.jpg)*Masahi Oiso, left, and Geoffrey Siron*


On the other side of the table sat Geoffrey Siron. At this year's World Championships his 23rd-place finish led the Belgian National team into the Team Finals. Another strong finish at this event and Siron will have solidified himself as a rising European star. Siron brought a traditional blue-green Madness deck to Pro Tour-Columbus.


Osyp came over at the start of the feature match yelling, "Masashi's going to win the Pro Tour. His deck is so good!" A smile briefly crossed Masashi's lips before he went back to shuffling.


### Game 1


Oiso began the match with a mulligan and then an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) after his second hand was acceptable. Siron also laid an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) but had a [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) to go along with his. The [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) put both [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) into the graveyard for Siron.



![Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Careful+Study)

Oiso played a second-turn [Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night)scape Familiar, Siron bluffed at [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) saying, "Wait, it's on the stack," before letting the Familiar resolve. Siron played out a second-turn [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) to get some beat down going.


Oiso started his third turn with a [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). and then an [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). Siron, meanwhile, played another [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), discarding a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), before sending his [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) in for two.


When Oiso attempted the [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) it was met with [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Oiso spent a lot of time considering his next move; eventually he decided to do nothing else and just passed the turn.


Siron played out an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and attacked with the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) again.


Oiso started to go off by playing a [Cloud of Faeries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), then a [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) (fetching [Snap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)). He [Snap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)ped the Faeries and recast followed by an empty [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), all preparing for a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) for six. He flipped up [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll), [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), and two lands.


Oiso played one of the lands and used the [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) to get a [Snap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap). [Snap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)ping the [Cloud of Faeries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) and recasting slowly began untapping some of his lands. A [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Brain Freeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) would prove almost lethal without any additional spells. Oiso did cast the [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and the [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor). After a [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) he [Snap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)ped the Faeries and recast them one last time. A [Brain Freeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) targeting Siron in response to a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) targeting Siron ended the first game.


**Oiso 1, Siron 0**


The black addition to the [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) deck is a new twist that hasn't been seen in large tournaments until this weekend. The single [Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night)scape Familiar let Oiso abuse the untap mechanic enough to create a small [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) while the [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) off of the Desire let Oiso top-deck the perfect spell.


### Game 2


Each player started the game with an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) but Oiso had a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and a [Sapphire Medallion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion). The Medallion was [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze)d but returning the [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) to his hand set Siron back an entire turn.


Oiso used his free turn to cast a [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) for [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), while Siron finally got in the game with a Wild Mongel. Oiso's third turn saw him casting the [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) to fetch [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcol05/fm10_2.jpg)*Masahi Oiso*
Siron attacked with the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and madnessed out a [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). He then played a [Thought Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Courier) and [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze)d an end step [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) attempt on Oiso's part. Oiso untapped and went for a three-point [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) but Siron discarded the rest of his hand to power up a [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Oiso only had one card remaining when he finally resolved a [Sapphire Medallion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion).


Siron sent in the beats for five. Oiso drew a second [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and you could tell that Siron wasn't happy. Oiso didn't have any other plays.


Siron started his turn by looting away a [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder). He then sent the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and [Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) into the Red Zone. After Siron pumped the [Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla), Oiso [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)ed for an [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) and sent the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) home. He took three damage down to 9. The [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) must not have been that powerful, otherwise Oiso would not have to take such a defensive measure.


When Siron recast the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), Oiso had a [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) waiting. Then Oiso played out a [Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night)scape Familiar. Siron cast a [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and got rid of a [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). The [Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) continued his lonesome beats.


When a [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) fetched the last [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) Oiso had a chance, until Siron played [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) on it sealing up the victory.


**Oiso 1, Siron 1**


### Game 3


Oiso led with and [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) while Siron had a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). When Oiso tried a second-turn [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), Siron hit it with [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) before the Imprint even resolved. This could have but didn't prevent Oiso from getting off an [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) the very next turn. Siron made an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) followed by a second [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) during this time. Oiso [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed during his main phase.



![Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aquamoeba)

Siron just sent the two [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and passed the turn. He had all the threats out he needed. When Oiso tried an [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), Siron responded with an [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze). The [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) shut down Oiso's [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition).


Siron send in his [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s again flipping both of them. On the end step Oiso tried a [Turnabout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout) to tap out Siron. Siron had two [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)s as his only cards in hand and decided to use one on the [Turnabout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout).


Oiso made a face when his [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) was countered by the second [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) but fought back with a [Snap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap) on an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and a [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for a [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius). All of Siron's hopes rested with his two [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba)'s flipping away.


Oiso drew a [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) and fetched his fourth [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). Now his hand was back up to five cards. Siron swung in for 4 but Oiso began to go off.


A [Sapphire Medallion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion) and two [Cloud of Faeries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) allowed for a four-point Desire. The four-point Minds Desire gave Oiso two more [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire)s! His second Desire for six gave him his very last [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire)! The third Desire was lethal for Siron when it revealed Tendrils of Despair.


**Final Score:**  
**Masashi Oiso 2 Geoffrey Siron 1**
