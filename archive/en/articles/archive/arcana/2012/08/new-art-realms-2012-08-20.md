On Friday, we showed you [all fifteen cards in *From the Vault: Realms*](/en/articles/archive/vault-realms-contents-2012-08-17). And that was fun. Everybody seemed to enjoy it. But *From the Vault: Realms* comes out next Friday (August 31, 2012), and it seems like a good week to do something a little more... Arcana-y.


So! Here's a closer look at all the new art that was made for the set. Whee!
