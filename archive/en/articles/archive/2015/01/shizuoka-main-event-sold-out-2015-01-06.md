The tournament organizer for Grand Prix Shizuoka, BIG MAGIC, announced on January 5 at 18:00 Japan Standard Time that capacity for the main event of the Grand Prix—2,256 players—had been reached.



All preregistered participants in the Grand Prix Shizuoka main event who have *not* paid for their entrance into the event by January 7 at 12:00 Japan Standard Time will have their preregistrations revoked. Any revoked entries into the main event will be available for registration at the event venue on January 9 starting at 13:00 Japan Standard Time on a first-come, first-serve basis.



Players who wish to register for the main event at the event venue on January 9 but are unable to because of maximum capacity will be able to register for a special Saturday morning *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck side event. All participants in this special event will receive the foil Griselbrand promo card that is given to all Grand Prix main-event participants.
