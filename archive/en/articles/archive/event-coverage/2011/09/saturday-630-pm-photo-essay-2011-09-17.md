*It all begins outside what looks like a garage. This is the unlikely home for Brazil Nationals 2011, here in Sao Paulo.*

*Pavement, kerb, car, anywhere is a great place to sit, chat, and trade.*

*Many players set up impromptu trader stalls out of the back of their cars. Seen in the middle here is Eduardo Dos Santos Vieira, otherwise known by his online name of L1X0.*

*It's quite warm work for putting decklists together. Why the hat?*

*Now that's a lot of trades!*

*With no official dealers, players make sure they bring all the useful commons and uncommons with them. Mana Leak could turn out to be a valuable commodity this weekend, who knows?*

*"So, if I take three of those, one of those, and two of those, you can have one of these, one of these, and a shiny one of these. Deal?" Whatever language it's in, the language of Magic trading remains the same.*



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/branat11/pe%209.jpg)

*There's being entrepreneurial, and then there's going one stage too far. I can honestly say I've never seen this at a Magic event before. At least, not brought by a player. WOW!!!*



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/branat11/pe%2010.jpg)

*Maybe I watch too many movies on aeroplanes these days, but am I the only one who thinks this looks like something out of a mob film? You've got the guys leaning on the sleek black car, the metal fencing and barred iron door in the background...What? Oh, right, just me then.*



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/branat11/pe%2011.jpg)

*"Look into my eyes. My eyes. They're up here. Don't look down there. Seriously, it's just a Pro Tour shirt. Stop staring. What are you, twelve?"*



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/branat11/pe%2012.jpg)

*Inside, the serious business of trying to win a Last Chance Qualifier is occupying lots of minds. Stage one is a decklist that won't cost you a game loss when you count to 57 instead of 60, or forget your sideboard altogether. Come on now, you know you've done this.*



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/branat11/pe%2013.jpg)

*It's entirely possible that the Brazilian Nationals version of the pairings boards aren't exactly what you're used to. Still, they work perfectly well. Unless, of course, it's raining. But it never rains in Brazil, right?*



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/branat11/pe%2014.jpg)

*You wonder what lengths we'll go to just so we can bring you the ups and downs of your favorite Magic players? Here's my personal work crew, inventing the internet before your very eyes. Possibly.*



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/branat11/pe%2015.jpg)

*For those already qualified, it's a chance to do some cube drafting at the nearby bar. Kick back, relax, play Magic, be in Brazil...life is really good.*
