Pascal Maynard was looking for his return. After a breakout year in 2012, Maynard passed through a quiet 2013 before finding himself in the Grand Prix Top 8 spotlight in 2014. Without several quarterfinal exits, Maynard was hungry for more: Pro Points, and Grand Prix victories, were critical pieces of maintaining Pro Players Club Status.


Winning meant more than just Pro Tour qualification.


For Scott Lipp, this was his ticket to the Pro Tour. While he would lose out on playing in a local Modern Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier, he gained far more in bragging rights among his friends: His smiles said it all.


**The Decks**


Lipp was playing hybrid deck, bridging the [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) power of [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) with [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) and [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach). [Summoning Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) and [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)s tied together a ramping package that could both cast powerful threats or go to the dome with triggers. It was an effective and exciting combination.


Maynard brought the emergent Blue-Red Delver, though adapted it to an aggressive extreme. The addition of [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) helped propel the damage output in the early game, putting immense pressure on his opponents from the start. Shifting the clock forward a turn or two was effective throughout the weekend.


However, Maynard’s only loss on the day was from Lipp’s powerful monsters.


“It was a savage beating,” as Lipp put it.


Would Maynard find his revenge to advance to the semifinals?


**The Games**


Maynard rushed out early, with [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and double [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) backed up by [Forked Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt) and more. It quickly put Lipp to just 4 life.


The second game was a slower affair as Maynard led with [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), though [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) answered it, before [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear)s finally began his attack. Playing more Delvers, which all flipped, Pascal overran Lipp’s limited ability to play. Without access to green mana throughout the game, Lipp had little opportunity to fight back.


**Pascal Maynard defeated Scott Lipp, 2-0, and advanced to the semifinals.**
