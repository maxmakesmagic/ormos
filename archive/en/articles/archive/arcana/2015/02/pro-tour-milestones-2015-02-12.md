[Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf), held just this past weekend, was a momentous tournament, full of wild swings, historic performances, and Spain's first Pro Tour Champion in the game's history. And, as Adam Styborski reported, it was also full of milestones for a number of notable pros.



In particular, we saw the following mile markers passed:



* Andrew Cuneo, Jamie Parke, and the 1st-ranked Owen Turtenwald all found their 200th win in a Pro Tour Match.
* Pro Tour Hall of Fame player William Jensen notched his 300th win on the Pro Tour.
* Hall of Fame player Brian Kibler earned a stunning 400th win.
* Matt Sperling played in his 300th match.
* Paul Rietzl, another Hall of Fame pro, played in his 500th match.
* Eric Froehlich, who made the Top 8 of the tournament, played in his 500th Pro Tour match.
* Craig Wescoe played match number 400 on the Pro Tour.


A number of these players shared their favorite matches and memories as they passed their historic milestones. [Adam Styborski talked with all of them](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf/measures-and-milestones) and shared many of their memories during the Pro Tour. For those with a taste for history, it's well worth the read.
