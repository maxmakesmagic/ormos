![1045](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1045)**[Reconstruction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1045)** – *Antiquities* common. The original printing of [Reconstruction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1045) in *Antiquities* was accidentally printed without an expansion symbol. It is therefore almost identical to the *Revised* version of [Reconstruction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1219), except for the color of its border.
 


![Lab Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lab+Rats)**[Lab Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lab+Rats)** – *Stronghold* common. Have you ever really looked at the art on [Lab Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lab+Rats)? That rat is in a tiny little wheelchair! Poor little rat!
 


![6112](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=6112)**[Sonic Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=6112)** – *Exodus* common. This week's card of the day theme has been, roughly "large bovines" like the buffalo. So you may be interested to know that an American buffalo that's doomed to get hit by a [Sonic Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Burst) cast by William Shakespeare could be anagrammed into a **Curst Bison**.
 


![Eyes of the Wisent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eyes+of+the+Wisent)**[Eyes of the Wisent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyes+of+the+Wisent)** – *Lorwyn* rare. "Wisent" is not a word invented for **Magic**. In fact, it's a name for the European bison. Fascinating!
 


![2549](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2549)**[Aurochs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2549)** – *Ice Age* common. When [Aurochs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurochs) was printed in *Ice Age*, it was the only card of its card type. But when *Coldsnap* came along years later, [Aurochs Herd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurochs+Herd), [Bull Aurochs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bull+Aurochs), and [Rimehorn Aurochs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimehorn+Aurochs) added to the herd.
 


![Ronin Cliffrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ronin+Cliffrider)**[Ronin Cliffrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Cliffrider)** – *Betrayers of Kamigawa* uncommon. That's a strange animal that the [Ronin Cliffrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Cliffrider) is riding. But it must be relatively common on Kamigawa, because [Godo, Bandit Warlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godo%2C+Bandit+Warlord) is also riding one.
 


![Pillarfield Ox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pillarfield+Ox)**[Pillarfield Ox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillarfield+Ox)** – ***Magic** 2013* common. There are [seven Ox creatures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&subtype=+%5Box%5D+!%5B%22Fox%22%5D) in **Magic**. In addition to the literal oxen ([Ironhoof](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironhoof), [Pillarfield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillarfield), [Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild), and [Zodiac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac)), there are two ox-shaped elementals ([Arc Runner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Runner) and [Longhorn Firebeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longhorn+Firebeast)) and [Raging Bull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Bull).
 


![2944](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2944)**[Giant Oyster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2944)** – *Homelands* uncommon. If you're not very good at identifying bivalves, here's the main difference between clams and oysters: clams move around and oysters don't. Also, sometimes oysters contain pearls.
 


![41139](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=41139)**[Barren Moor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=41139)** – *Onslaught* common. When cycling was introduced in *Urza's Saga*, all the costs were ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif). This allowed for some shenanigans with [Fluctuator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator), so when cycling came back in *Onslaught*, it had more interesting costs, like [Barren Moor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Moor)'s ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif).
 


![139396](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=139396)**[Plover Knights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=139396)** – *Lorwyn* common. Plovers are real-world birds, which the Kithkin [Plover Knights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plover+Knights) ride. If you're curious, a group of plovers is a "Stand," a "Wing," or a "Congregation."
 


![Mystifying Maze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mystifying+Maze)**[Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze)** – ***Magic** 2011* rare. As a maze that neutralizes an attacking creature, [Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze) is a riff on [Maze of Ith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1824). It's unknown how [Ith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ith) feels about his maze being out-mystified.
 


![Wit's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wit%27s+End)**[Wit's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wit%27s+End)** – ***Magic** 2013* rare. According to [Wit's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wit%27s+End), it costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) to have any player discard his or her hand. If you're trying to do it on the cheap, [One With Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+With+Nothing) lets you do it for only ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), although it does come with the slight drawback that the player has to be you.
 


![Switcheroo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Switcheroo)**[Switcheroo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Switcheroo)** – ***Magic** 2013* uncommon. From the [***Magic** 2013* FAQ](/en/node/634476): You don't have to control either target. If the same player controls both creatures when Switcheroo resolves, nothing happens.
 


![Serra Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Serra+Avatar)**[Serra Avatar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avatar)** – ***Magic** 2013* mythic rare. From the [***Magic** 2013* FAQ](/en/node/634476): The ability that defines [Serra Avatar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avatar)'s power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield.
 


![Public Execution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Public+Execution)**[Public Execution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Public+Execution)** – ***Magic** 2013* uncommon. From the [***Magic** 2013* FAQ](/en/node/634476): Only creatures controlled by the player when [Public Execution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Public+Execution) resolves will get -2/-0. Creatures that enter the battlefield under that player's control or that the player gains control of later in the turn are unaffected.
 


![Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Omniscience)**[Omniscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience)** – ***Magic** 2013* mythic rare. From the [***Magic** 2013* FAQ](/en/node/634476): If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
 ![Ring of Evos Isle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ring+of+Evos+Isle)**[Ring of Evos Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Evos+Isle)** – ***Magic** 2013* uncommon. Wondering where Evos Isle is? The [***Magic** 2013* FAQ](/en/node/634476) has the answer! "The Magic 2013 core set has a cycle of Equipment that, in addition to giving the equipped creature another bonus, puts a +1/+1 counter on the equipped creature on each of your turns if it's a specific color. Each is named for a particular kingdom, country, or location on the plane of Shandalar."
