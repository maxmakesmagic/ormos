The gods of *Theros* have a divine gift for the mortal realm! The next *Journey into Nyx* booster pack you open may be filled with the entire pantheon of the Mythic Rare gods from throughout the *Theros* block.


If you’re playing in a Limited tournament and open a booster pack with all 15 of the *Theros* gods, be sure to bring it to the attention of a Judge or the Tournament Organizer. They may ask you to set aside those cards and open a different booster pack to use in the event.
