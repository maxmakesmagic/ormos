 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






 When you're the No. 2 Ranked Player in the world and the wider-than-you-think-margin of 8 or so Pro Points behind the No. 1 Ranked player, Jeremy Dezani, how do you overtake the leader to claim the top spot? It's a question Reid Duke is trying to answer, and had begun with an undefeated draft that turned into a 7-1 Day One record at Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*.




 While the draft viewer covers each of his Day One Draft picks, there's more to the story than simply seeing the end results. How does one of the preeminent players in the world handle *Theros* block Draft?



"I felt like I had a bit of a leg up since I played so much of the previous two sets," Duke said. "My number one priority was to learn the new cards, and if they changed anything about drafting the next two sets. Number two was to shake the rust off and make sure I was completely sharp and in fighting shape."


"In terms of my strategy," Duke continued, "I usually try to avoid red unless all things being equal I open something really good. I try to go any combination of white, blue, green, or black, with white-blue and black-anything being my favorite combos."



 Are there archetypes to *Theros* block Draft? If so, do they define the format?



"Not really," Duke said. "I think that the most important thing is a well-balanced deck with a nice curve and some removal spells. You don't want any holes in your deck. Once you accomplish that it definitely benefits to have key synergies that benefit you as the games go on to get an advantage in the late game."





*No. 2 Ranked Player Reid Duke's assessment on the draft format? Build a well-balanced deck with a nice curve and removal. Don't leave holes in your curve.*
