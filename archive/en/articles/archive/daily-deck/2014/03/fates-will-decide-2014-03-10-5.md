 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 






 The first game of the night had been going pretty well, then Jesse decided things were getting out of hand, so he used Jaya Ballard's third ability, doing 6 damage to all creatures and players. That effectively reset the board, except for your [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost). Harry played another land and dropped a smaller creature that really didn't affect the board in any way. John followed up on his turn with [Deranged Hermit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit) and a flashed back [Chatter of the Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel). That was going to be annoying, but Jesse is capable of handling several small creatures. 

 On the next round, Jesse played a kicked [Goblin Ruinblaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ruinblaster) and took out one of your [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)s. John followed up with [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) and attacked you with four of the Squirrel tokens and Harry with the other two tokens and the [Deranged Hermit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit). Your [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost) can block one of the Squirrels but the remaining Squirrels are coming in for a lethal 21 damage! 

 Unfortunately, you chose [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph). You gave up the instant speed [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation) offered for the ability to copy artifacts. You shake your head in disgust as you realize John and his stupid Squirrels have taken you out of yet another game! The Fates have not smiled upon you; you have suffered an ignominious death at the hands of those filthy rodents.
