*Sixteen top players from around the world  

Fifteen rounds of head to head competition  

Five unique formats  

Four days of stiff competition  

Two finalists in a five-format final  
**One champion***


Welcome to the 2000 Magic Invitational held in Sydney, Australia. Here, the best of the best face off against one another in Magic's all-star game for a chance to design thier very own Magic card, as well as an invitation to the 2001 Invitational, to be held in Cape Town, South Africa. As this is a round robin tournament, during the first three days, each player will play each other competitior once with the top two players advancing to the finals.


As always, you have a front seat for the action. The Invitational, by design, is Magic's most spectator friendly event. With interviews, articles, behind the scenes news and round by round coverage, we will bring you all the excitement.


I always like to say that the Magic Invitational is the tournament where every match is a feature match. So, sit back and enjoy as the action unfolds.
