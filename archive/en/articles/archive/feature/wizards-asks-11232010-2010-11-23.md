*What local game store do you frequent?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** In the Seattle area, we are blessed with a fine selection of local game stores. I'm a huge fan of the [Uncle's](http://www.unclesgames.com/) chain of game stores, which are mostly in malls and are geared to serve both the casual visitor and the hardcore gamer.

But my most frequent haunt is [Shane's Big League Sports Cards](http://www.shanescards.com/), which is right on my way home from work and nearly always has what I'm looking for. The crew at Shane's has gotten used to my wife and me coming in and asking for, say, ten thousand identical black sleeves for a cube-style project, or some weirdo selection of old boosters for our latest experiment in Winston drafting.

The only thing Shane's is lacking in is space, but they're moving to a bigger location in the same mini-mall any day now, so I'm looking forward to checking out their new place. It's nice to have a local place where, as the saying goes, everybody knows your name.
