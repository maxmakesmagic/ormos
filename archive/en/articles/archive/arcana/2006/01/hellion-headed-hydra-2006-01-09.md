We hope you've already checked out Mark Rosewater's [preview article](/it/node/616266) for today, which shows off **Ulasht, the Hate Seed**. 


Ulasht, a legendary hydra who inhabits ruined areas of Ravnica, is revered by the [Gruul](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/guildpact/gruul) as a symbol of ultimate anarchy. [Hydra creatures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=hydra&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=54&y=16) in **Magic** often grow and shrink as they gain or lose heads, and Ulasht is no exception. Furthermore, as you can see in the art by Nottsuo, each of its heads ends in a chaotic mass of tentacles:

Ulasht actually has the heads of a *hellion*. A hellion in **Magic** is an enormous, wormlike creature with a ring of tentacles surrounding a toothy maw. Compare Ulasht's art to that of these other hellions through the ages:

*[Flowstone Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Hellion), [Crater Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater+Hellion), [Iron-Barb Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron-Barb+Hellion)*


A hydra, with every head a hellion? The Gruul might be onto something...
