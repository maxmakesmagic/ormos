What I Learned on my Wacky Draft Vacation (Part Two)

 Welcome back to Part Two. If you haven't read Part One yet, check it out [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/dl21).




 Two weeks ago, I started showing some offbeat Wacky Drafts I've played. Hidden in all the wackiness, I found some examples of what *Magic* does right and wrong when *Magic* cards interact from two different blocks years apart. In particular, the Reject Rare Draft demonstrated the pitfalls of parasitism. The *Onslaught*-*Legions*-*Coldsnap* draft showed how potentially parasitic mechanics like "creature type matters" can avoid those pitfalls.




 This week I'll show a truly crazy draft I did with twenty-four packs from twenty-four different sets, and talk about what it teaches. Then I'll take you through an even crazier draft I did that contained cards from over 40 sets, from [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) and all the Moxes through [Survival of the Fittest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) through [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), and talk about what that one teaches.



### Night of the Twenty-Four-Pack Wacky Draft



![Twenty-four packs of fun!](https://web.archive.org/web/20090603034831id_/https://www.wizards.com/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/latest/dl23_packs.jpg)One dark and stormy night, we threw a party for Wizards Digital Games developer and former Building on a Budget columnist [Nate Heiss](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/authorarchive). Nate decreed an exceptionally wacky draft, so we collected twenty-four packs from twenty-four different sets. But of course we couldn't just draft the cards—first we had to draft the *packs*. What three packs would you have in front of you as the main draft began? Whatever three you drafted in the preliminary pack draft.



Nate went first, and faced this choice of first pick packs. Which would you pick from this list?



*Seventh Edition*, *Eighth Edition*, *Ninth Edition*, *Tenth Edition*, *Mercadian Masques*, *Nemesis*, *Prophecy*, *Onslaught*, *Legions*, *Scourge*, *Mirrodin*, *Darksteel*, *Fifth Dawn*, *Champions*, *Betrayers*, and *Saviors of Kamigawa*, *Ravnica*, *Guildpact*, *Dissension*, *Coldsnap*, *Time Spiral*, *Planar Chaos*, *Unhinged*, *Portal Second Age*




 Nate chose *Ravnica: City of Guilds*. *Mercadian Masques* was the first set on which I qualified for the Pro Tour, and I've always had a soft spot for it, so I picked up Masques first, even though I probably could have tabled it around and picked the pack up with my second or third pick.




 While some happily scoffed at *Mercadian Masques*, I happily opened a first pick [Waterfront Bouncer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waterfront+Bouncer). If you have never had this guy before, I assure you: especially for a common, he's pretty insane! Here's what I ended up building:

40 Cards 




![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Island)

















The deck definitely exemplified blue-black across the ages: solid removal, tons of bounce spells, evasion, card advantage, all on a pretty good curve. I was happy with how it turned out.



 You might think a deck from this Wacky Draft format couldn't have any synergies—just a bunch of good cards doing their own thing. After all, the deck is made from tons of widely varying sets eight years apart. *Mirrodin* is full of artifact synergies, but many sets have hardly any artifacts at all. Kamigawa's spirit-matters mechanics would be hard-pressed to find friends. And *Masques*' Rebels and Mercenaries would not find many buddies to search up.




 But if you look closer, you'll see that there are actually a lot of subtle synergies from sets years apart. This is because *Magic* has tons of built-in open-ended synergy pieces just looking for a partner. For example, the deck has seven bounce spells:




![Seal of Removal, Phantom Wings, Waterfront Bouncer, boomerang, Regress, Temporal Eddy, and Double Header](https://web.archive.org/web/20090603034829id_/https://www.wizards.com/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/latest/dl23_cardfan.jpg)


And these bounce spells have a lot of synergy with the other cards I drafted:



> 
> * [Shaper Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) + bounce = Stack combat damage again & kill your other guy again.
> * [Riptide Survivor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Survivor) + bounce = Stack combat damage again & draw cards again.
> * autocard>Highway Robber + bounce = Stack combat damage again & drain you for 2 again.
> * [Double Header](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Double+Header) + bounce = Stack combat damage again & bounce your guy again.
> * [Chittering Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chittering+Rats) + bounce my guy = Stack combat damage again & [Fatigue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatigue) you again.
> * [Chittering Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chittering+Rats) + bounce your guy = [Fatigue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatigue) you even though your hand was empty.
> * End of turn bounce + main phase bounce + [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) = You discard a ton.
> * [Survivor of the Unseen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survivor+of+the+Unseen) + bounce = Reset cumulative upkeep to zero.
> * [Temporal Eddy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Eddy) + [Lurking Informant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Informant) = Goodbye forever.
> * [Chittering Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chittering+Rats) + [Lurking Informant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Informant) = Goodbye forever.
> * [He Who Hungers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=He+Who+Hungers) + bounce = Goodbye forever.
> 



 In particular, my old *Mercadian Masques* experience popped up when I picked up *Tenth Edition*'s [Highway Robber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highway+Robber) to put the [Waterfront Bouncer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waterfront+Bouncer) + [Highway Robber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highway+Robber) band back together, reconstituting a janky old Masques combo to chump-block with [Highway Robber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highway+Robber) then bounce it every turn to drain the last few points of life.




 To be a little crueler, [Waterfront Bounce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waterfront+Bounce) + [Chittering Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chittering+Rats) might allow me to draw-lock my opponent on an expensive card and keep him or her from ever drawing a new card again.




 Bounce is incredibly versatile in general, and it creates synergies with a million different things. When playing sets together from years apart, bounce serves as a "universal interface," in that it's half of the combo for a million different combos. Whatever *Magic* set you pick up, it will have a million awesome things to combine with your bounce spells.




*Magic* designers and developers are constantly on the lookout for open-ended effects like this that can serve as universal interfaces. Sometimes they can appear on multiple commons in a set, as bounce does. Sometimes they appear less frequently: [Astral Slide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) and [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) are good examples in that they just do soooo many different things with so many different cards in every set. And sometimes they're specific cards: [Spellweaver Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Helix) and [Sunforger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunforger) are very open-ended, in that they interact with tons of different cards in every *Magic* set in different ways.





![Mothdust Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mothdust%20Changeling&options=)

*Onslaught* block's Mistform creatures and *Lorwyn* block's changelings both act as universal interfaces for any tribal mechanic in any set. They're skeleton keys that serve as the second half in any two-card tribal combo from any *Magic* tribe. If you own [Seshiro the Anointed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seshiro+the+Anointed) and you're looking for Snakes, [Mistform Dreamer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer) and [Chameleon Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus) can each fit the bill, just like they fit [Thrull Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrull+Champion) or [Lord of the Undead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Undead) or whatever other tribal combos you want to match.
 



 To use my wacky draft as an example, I have [Crypt Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Sliver) and [He Who Hungers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=He+Who+Hungers) mostly because they're tribal cards that work pretty well even without any other members of their tribe on the board. Did I have any other Slivers or Spirits in my deck to create tribal-synergy combos with [Crypt Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Sliver) or [He Who Hungers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=He+Who+Hungers)? No. But I did have [Mistform Seaswift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Seaswift) as a universal interface for tribal mechanics that could act as a Sliver or a Spirit whenever needed. And did I spring the trap on opponents who didn't see my [Mistform Seaswift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Seaswift) + [Crypt Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Sliver) combo and eat their fliers with a regenerating Seaswift? Sure did.
 



 In many ways these universal interfaces, from bounce to Mistforms, are the exact opposite of the parasitism that can be so frustrating when combining cards from years apart. [Glacial Crevasses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Crevasses) and [Pious Kitsune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pious+Kitsune) are frustrating because they don't work well except with one specific card in *Magic*. [Regress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regress) and [Mistform Seaswift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Seaswift) are a lot of fun partially because they work very well with so many different cards in *Magic*.
 



 Best moment of the draft: My opponent taps out for [Greater Morphling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Morphling), which will untap and deal a lethal 18 damage to me in one turn. (I mean, [who makes](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/authorarchive) these cards?!?) Having no cards and nothing but 2/2s in play, I draw and send in the team. He blocks, and I reveal the randomly top-decked [Dakmor Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dakmor+Plague) to finish off [Greater Morphling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Morphling) and win the game. Yeah *Portal Second Age*!
 


### Day of the Invitational Cube Draft



 Paul Sottosanti and Aaron Forsythe teamed up to create an awesome [Draft Cube](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/mi07/cubelist) for this past year's [Magic Invitational](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/mi07/welcome). Drawing on the vast collection of a trusted friend, the Cube contained one each of *Magic*'s most famous power cards, including [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), the Moxes, [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk), [Mana Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Crypt), etc., the best control / combo cards of all time, including [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) and [Yawgmoth's Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Will), and the best aggressive cards of all time, including [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isamaru%2C+Hound+of+Konda) and [Fireblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast).
 



 To get it ready for the Invitational, it was R&D's sworn duty to take the Cube out for a few draft test runs, then tweak it as necessary. As the draft proceeded, I focused on white-blue weenies, with a low curve, eight two-drops including five powerful WW white weenies, lots of evasion, tapping down opposing mana with [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) & [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), and efficient [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) effects. If aggro-control "Fish" decks are good against [Yawgmoth's Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Will)s in vintage, why not here? [Black Vise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Vise), [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port), [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), [Old Man of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Old+Man+of+the+Sea), [Parallax Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave), and *Portal*'s [Sea Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Drake) were all extremely powerful in the deck, and [Library of Alexandria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria) was a nice "Oops, turn 1 Library, I guess I win" card to have in the deck as well.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Island)


















 The craziest game came versus wacky master Mark Gottlieb. With all the craziness, I might make a math error somewhere, but this is the core of the story: His first turn was [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). Not too shabby. Fortunately, I could almost keep up with my third-turn [Library of Alexandria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria). Yup, that's the format.
 



 By turn six, Mark had [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker), [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), and [Grinning Ignus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Ignus). He tapped two mountains and used Garruk to untap them and tap them again for four red mana total. He returned [Grinning Ignus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Ignus) to his hand and played it again, four times in a row. Then he played [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) for ten Goblin tokens and started using his [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s to equip each of them with [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), drawing two cards for every mana he spent!
 


The good news for my side was that my evasive white weenies had almost finished Mark off. Mark had made ten extra creatures and drawn eight extra cards this turn, but he was quickly running out of mana, and all the cards in the world wouldn't do him any good if he didn't have any mana left to cast them. After Mark clamped the final time and had only one red mana left. Despite a hand of 11 cards, one red mana wasn't going to help Mark survive my vast army. Except that Gottlieb had finally found the one card he had been frantically digging for:




![Firestorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Firestorm&options=)


[Firestorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firestorm)!
 


One red mana plus tons of extra cards meant all of my guys dead at once plus 6 damage to my face! That Gottlieb sure knows how to Wacky Draft.



 I had just one more backup plan: [Sea Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Drake). Gottlieb could not nuke this sick flier, and it did him in.
 



 In the next game vs. Gottlieb, Mark drew first and played turn-two [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth). I gleefully responded by playing [Aven Mindcensor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor). Mark dutifully searched the top 4 cards of his library... and found no lands! Onlookers groaned and shouted. Mark topdecked a land on his next turn and played [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), hoping to get revenge on the Mindcensor by finding two basic lands in the top four cards....and again finding zero! The groans turned to howls and cheers. Several people had questioned whether [Aven Mindcensor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor) belonged in the Cube alongside [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), but moments like this really show off his swingy excitement value.
 


So what lessons can we pull from the Cube Draft about how cards play together from years apart? Here it is: When semi-parasitic mechanics come back in later blocks, it actually reduces how parasitic they are because they now have some buddies in other blocks to play with.



 My draft deck had the shadow creatures [Soltari Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Champion) and 
 Looter *il*-Kor
 . When shadow creatures existed only in *Tempest* block, they were a little bit parasitic in that they could only ever block or become blocked by other creatures with shadow, a subset of creatures in *Tempest* block. But when *Time Spiral* block brought back shadow, in formats like Cube Draft or casual kitchen table *Magic* that combine many years of sets all together, shadow was actually less parasitic than it was in its *Tempest* days. My [Soltari Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Champion) and 
 Looter *il*-Kor
  in my Cube Draft could each interact well with an enemy [Soltari Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Monk) by blocking and killing it, even though [Soltari Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Champion) comes from *Stronghold* and 
 Looter *il*-Kor
  comes from *Time Spiral* a decade later.

 Likewise, Slivers were a parasitic mechanic when they emerged in *Tempest*. Unlike the long histories of Elves and Zombies, no other creatures in *Magic* were Slivers, so [Winged Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winged+Sliver) only worked with a very small subset of cards. But then *Legions* brought slivers back years later. The *Legions* Slivers were less parasitic than their *Tempest* cousins had been, simply because when the *Legions* Slivers came out, they could interact well with all their *Legions* Sliver sisters, plus their old *Tempest* block cousins. And when *Time Spiral* block brought Slivers back again, they were even less parasitic than before in casual "play all sets" formats, because the *Time Spiral* block slivers could interact with all the *Time Spiral* block slivers, plus the *Legions* slivers, plus the *Tempest* block slivers. Plus *Onslaught* blocks's Mistforms. Plus *Lorwyn* block's changelings.
 



 Morphs showed this phenomenon in both the twenty-four-pack draft and the Cube Draft. When *Onslaught* had just come out, the number of morphs that a face-down card could possibly be was fairly limited. But as the *Onslaught* block continued more and more morphs, then *Time Spiral* block added even more morphs, the number of possible identities for any face-down creature gets larger and larger and larger. So a semi-parasitic mechanic like Slivers or morph actually gets more layered, more deep, and less parasitic every time it comes back.
 


### Planting a Seed



[Last week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/dl21) I talked about why *Onslaught* block was wise to include many tribes with long histories in *Magic*. The main reason is that tribal mechanics with completely new tribes (like Moonfolk) are parasitic, meaning they only work well with cards in their own block. Meanwhile, tribal mechanics with tribes that span across all of *Magic* (like Wizard) are non-parasitic, because they can play well with cards from a huge variety of Magic sets. But if naming tribes with long histories is better, than why name new tribes like Kithkin or Treefolk at all? Why not always stick to existing creature types?

 

 



 The main answer is that if we always stuck with existing recurring creature types, we could never start any new recurring creature types. If we always stuck to existing creature types to avoid any parasitic cards, we could never have made Slivers. But when we went out on a limb in *Tempest* and made a parasitic mechanic by making Slivers, we laid the groundwork for a tribe that would eventually become one of the most beloved tribes in *Magic*, recurring several times across the game's history.
 



 And when *Lorwyn* introduced Treefolk and especially Kithkin, as almost completely new tribes, it is laying the groundwork for Treefolk and/or Kithkin to come back later in *Magic*'s history. Like Slivers in *Tempest*, Treefolk and Kithkin are planting new seeds that we may be able to harvest in the future. I can't say when, but I bet we'll see both of them again after *Lorwyn* is complete.
 


### Last Week's Poll

| --- |
| **Changes to improve Magic for the long-term often cause short-term turmoil. Examples include the Restricted List, the play/draw rule, Paris mulligans instead of no-land or all-land mulligans, *Sixth Edition* rules, foils, the new card frame, and creature type updates. Which should we do?**  |
| Make the long-term change now. It's worth the complaining and turmoil in the short term to keep the game strong for the long term. | 5405 | 85.8% |
| Stop making long-term changes. Keep Magic as close to its original form as possible. | 891 | 14.2% |
| **Total** | **6296** | **100.0%** |


 This poll set up a lot of chatter about which changes in *Magic*'s past were the best or worst, and what changes could still come up in *Magic*'s future. It's also a poll where I gave my own views right up front in the article: For me the changes in *Magic* in the past have almost always turned out for to be good for the game, and I'm glad we made them.
