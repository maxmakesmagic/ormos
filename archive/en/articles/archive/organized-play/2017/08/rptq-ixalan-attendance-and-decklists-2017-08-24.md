We're not wasting any time this week. You want a look at the last round of RPTQs and some decklists, so we're going to deliver those without any frills.


Last weekend was the near conclusion of this round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers, which qualified top finishing players from each event to Pro Tour *Ixalan* in Albuquerque, New Mexico, November 3–5. The final RPTQ takes place on *Magic Online* this weekend, and after that, the round is complete.


Here's a look at what attendance was like at each of this round's RPTQs.
