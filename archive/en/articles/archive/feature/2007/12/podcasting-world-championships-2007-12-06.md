- **[Saturday, 10:05 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show13.mp3): Team Title Time (20.9 MB mp3)**
Twenty-two rounds of gargantuan effort mean that you don't get to the team World Championship final by chance. As we enter the last desperate duels of the day, defending champions the Netherlands still have a chance of going all the way. Find out whether they can make it to the final showdown in our final show from Worlds 2007 that also includes an interview with the Manager of R&D, Aaron Forsythe. 

- **[Saturday, 6:52 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show12.mp3): What's Magic Online Worth? (20.7 MB mp3)**
And Worth Wollpert, Brand director for Magic Digital, gives us plenty of great answers, including a fact about **Magic Online**  so startling that it almost reduced me to silence. The race in the league of nations hots up, and by the end of Round 20, one of the finalists will be known. Find out who's in with games to spare. 

- **[Saturday, 2:21 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show11.mp3): Your Ultra-Gratuitous Great Britain Experience (22.1 MB mp3)**
Well,not quite, but we do showcase the talented pair of 10th-placed finisher Stuart Wright and Mr. [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix+)  himself Craig Jones as we embark upon six rounds of nation against nation. *Lorwyn*  brings all sorts of tribal possibilities to the table, and that can only be amplified with multiple opponent interactions. Plus we wrap up two outstanding days of competition and look forward to Super Sunday. 

- **[Friday, 10:15 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show10.mp3): Not the End of the Swiss.... (12.0 MB mp3)**
... because they're leading the team competition at the end of Day Two here at Worlds 2007. It is the end of the Swiss rounds however, with 16 now behind us. As a result, we have an individual Top 8 packed away ready to come out and play on Sunday. First, we have the Team Day to look forward to, where Two-Headed Gant and national camaraderie take centre stage. But in this, our final show of Worlds Friday, we tell the story of the crucial final rounds of Legacy, and bring the Top 8 to you. Trust me, there are some great names, and some surprising ones too. Find out who's in, at the click of a button.

- **[Friday, 6:21 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show9.mp3): Defining Legacy (18.2 MB mp3)**
The final format of the Swiss rounds is upon us, and it promises to be quite a wild ride. Plenty of players turned up for Worlds without a serviceable Legacy deck, and it looks like plenty of players have gone into action with, let us say, suboptimal builds. For the players at the top of the standings, they will be hoping that their choice of archetype can stand up to the varied Metagame on display here. We bring you all the decks that matter -- the good, the bad, and the ugly, and speaking of the good the bad and the ugly, we interview them too!

- **[Friday, 3:35 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show8.mp3): Drafting Done (23.7 MB mp3)**
Two of the three formats that will determine the Top 8 of Worlds are in the books, and the leaderboard is every bit as cosmopolitan as you could expect or wish for. Plenty of big names are mixing with some tasty surprises, and the big question as we head for Legacy is whether these lesser-lights of the **Magic**  kingdom will stutter down the home stretch. No sign of any nerves from the leader right now, the undefeated....well, you'll have to listen to find out.

- **[Friday, 11:45 a.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show7.mp3): Whadda Ya Mean Ya Missed Day One? (13.5 MB mp3)**
Rumor has reached our ears here at **magicthegathering.com**  that some people out there in something called the "Real World" have had to work through Day One of Worlds, and are yet to read the many thousands of words, see the hundreds of pictures, and partake of the hours of audio and video coverage. Never fear, moxnews is here, getting you up to speed with the fastest five minutes in gaming (taking approximately 300 seconds.) We take a look at a post-Worlds Standard and preview the day ahead, with all the races still there to be won.

- **[Thursday, 10:50 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show6.mp3): At the End of the Day (21.9 MB mp3)**
That's how Broadway show Les Miserables starts, but there's nothing miserable about players like Patrick Chapin, Katsuhiro Mori, Gabriel Nassif and Tomaharu Saito, all of whom have had decent starts as we reach the halfway point of the Individual Swiss rounds. We talk to Hall of Famer Zvi Mowshowitz and take you through the first three rounds of Booster Draft. Plenty are still in the running, but for others it's a long road back. Join us for all the *Lorwyn*  action, and then get a good night's sleep -- you're going to need it.

- **[Thursday, 6:33 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show5.mp3): Standard-Bearers (14.1 MB mp3)**
The first of three nerve-jangling formats is over here in New York, and there have been some surprise casualties in the Player of the Year Race. Two of the contenders have left themselves the proverbial mountain to climb, with just one win in five attempts. All the rest have positive records, and in this show we wrap up Standard in a warm woolly blanket ready for Sunday, and bring you the highlights from a top table draft that you'll be able to recreate via God's gift to **Magic**, the Draft Viewer. 

- **[Thursday, 3:07 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show4.mp3): The Starting Gun (22.4 MB mp3)**
So you know it's a marathon and not a sprint, right? That doesn't mean you don't need a good start at this hyper-competitive tournament of champions. We bring you the story of the first three rounds of Standard, including news of a highly entertaining archetype that's been well under the radar, and we begin our Path to Glory, taking you from start to finish, right here on **magicthegathering.com**.

- **[Thursday, 11:39 a.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show3.mp3): The Metagame Runaround (21.3 MB mp3)**
As players desperately scramble for the last few cards for their Standard decks, we brave the crowd to bring you all the news and views from the top Pros. We chat with the Player of the Year contenders, great players past and present, and shape up the metagame to come. With Round One just around the corner, hear what the people who count are saying.

- **[Thursday, 8:52 a.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show1.mp3): Worlds Preview (14.8 MB mp3)**
There's so much to get through at Worlds this year. With the Individual World Champion, the Team Event, the Player of the Year Race and more, we mark your card as we head for Round One. Plus, exclusive insight from the inside track on the Japanese **Magic**  scene, as Saitou, Tsumura and Kurihara reveal their thoughts on the week ahead.

- **[Wednesday, 10:04 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07newyork/worlds07show2.mp3): The Opening Ceremonies (18.6 MB mp3)**
Join us for full coverage of the pageant and spectacle that is the Worlds Opening Ceremony. Fifty-five national flags entered the arena Wednesday before the mighty Hall of Fame Class of 2007 received their rings: Buehler, Herzog, Mowshowitz, Fujita and Budde. Hear all the action right here.
