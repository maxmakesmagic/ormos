What Is the *Magic Online* Bug Blog?


While the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) is simply that—a running list of issues we expect players to encounter most often—this accompanying “Bug Blog” is the list’s companion. Here you’ll find updates regarding emergent new issues, details around issue statuses when applicable, known issue workarounds, and a running tally of Known Issues List updates. The Bug Blog will be updated each Thursday, in conjunction with the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) on the same day.

**Known Issues List Updates**


Lots of updates this week in preparation for the *Magic Online* *Fate Reforged* Prerelease, beginning Friday, January 30. Check out the list below for a break-down of what's new since last week's Bug Blog. Refer to the [Known Issues List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-known-issues) for the most current *Magic Online* Known Issues.




---

**Fixed During the Wednesday, January 28 *Magic Online* Client Update**


**Game Play**



* Exodus | Fixed a crash that was caused when Fade Away was cast while there were multiple creatures on the battlefield
* General | Fixed an issue that caused cards that have multiple targets to select, such as [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) or [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan), have the 'OK' improperly grayed out preventing users from being able to proceed
* General | Fixed an issue that caused choices such as shuffling with Ponder to incorrectly register the incorrect response from the player
* KTK | You can now select opponent’s creatures while casting [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast) even if you don’t control a creature
* MMA | [Deepcavern Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp) no longer forces the player to pay Echo


**Client**



* Duel Scene | We have redone the prompt that player’s receive after a game ends to accurately reflect who has won the game and/or match




---

**Newly Added Known Issues as of Wednesday, January 28**


**Game Play**



* FRF | Face-down manifested cards that change controllers have incorrect art assets when viewed by the new controller
* FRF | If a manifested creature has been granted a keyword ability that the face up creature naturally has, it will not properly display blue text to the controller indicating that the manifested creature also has that ability. For example, if you have a face-down manifested Flying Men then Lightform will not give blue rules text indicating 'Flying' on a the face-down side of the card. Even lacking the blue text, the creature will have flying properly.
* FRF | Two-colored land textbox backgrounds only display one color

**Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues**



We're hard at work on whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly |
| General | Players can experience memory leaks in some situations | Restarting the client can temporarily resolve these issues |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues |

**Server**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Issue Description** | **Temporary Workaround** |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem |
