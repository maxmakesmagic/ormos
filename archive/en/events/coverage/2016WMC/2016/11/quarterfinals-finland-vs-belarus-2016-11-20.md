Belarus had almost broken through to the Top 8 at the World *Magic* Cup the previous year, finishing in ninth place. This year's captain Pavel Miadzvedski had been on the team then as well, as he had been for every World *Magic* Cup. Ihar Klionski had made the Belarussian team before too, whereas Finland's four were all new to the tournament.


For the matchups in this quarterfinal pairing, one thing was certain: sideboarding would play a crucial role. Finland's Lauri Pispa and his Lantern Control deck might be able to lock down the first game with the help of [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) and the combination of [Lantern of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+of+Insight) plus [Codex Shredder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Codex+Shredder)/[Ghoulcaller's Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghoulcaller%27s+Bell)/[Pyxis of Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyxis+of+Pandemonium), but Jund player Dmitry Andronchik would bring in a lot of additional artifact removal for the second game.


Likewise, Matti Kuisma's Dredge was favored against Ihar Klionski's Bant Eldrazi, but not so much against the [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) and [Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) in Klionski's sideboard.


Finally, Leo Lahonen's Blue-Red [Kiln Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend) was something of a wild card. Belarus, represented by Pavel Miadzvedski, brought Affinity to this fight, and it wasn't clear how the two decks matched up. With one [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) in Affinity's sideboard and two [Shattering Spree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Spree)s for the blue-red deck, the dynamic at least wouldn't shift dramatically after the first game.


Seat C: Leo Lahonen (Blue-Red Kiln Fiend) vs. Pavel Miadzvedski (Affinity)
==========================================================================


The most important card in this matchup turned out to be [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice), summoned to the battlefield by Lahonen on turn two. The players fought over the 0/4; [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) tried to kill it, but [Mutagenic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) saved it. Soon the creatures on the board amounted to just one [Awoken Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awoken+Horror). Miadzvedski's draw didn't offer much to impede the giant 7/8, and Lahonen rode it to victory.

*Pavel Miadzvedski (right) couldn't throw enough in the way of Leo Lahonen's (left) [Awoken Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awoken+Horror).*


Going first in Game 2, Miadzvedski led with the single [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) in his sideboard. When that came down on turn two, Lahonen had only cast a single [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) and was now stuck with a whopping five one-mana cards in his hand. Luckily, [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) came to save the day and didn't care whether spells were countered—it just wanted to see them cast. So, on turn three Lahonen cast [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag), [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), and a pair of [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)s, and awoke the Horror once again. Miadzvedski fell to 12, a convenient number, as next turn he chumped with [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) and took 12 when [Awoken Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awoken+Horror) developed a serious case of [Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage).


**Leo Lahonen defeated Pavel Miadzvedski 2-0.**


Seat A: Lauri Pispa (Lantern Control) vs. Dmitry Andronchik (Jund)
==================================================================


The game began with the players trading discard spells. Soon a situation developed where Pispa had [Lantern of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+of+Insight) and [Pyxis of Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyxis+of+Pandemonium) to exert some influence over everybody's draws. But he didn't have [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) yet and was under attack by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). Even when [Codex Shredder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Codex+Shredder) and [Ghoulcaller's Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghoulcaller%27s+Bell) increased his library manipulation abilities considerably, [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) remained absent.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/2016wmc/WMC-20161119-2260.jpg)  
*Lauri Pispa (left) needed to find an answer to Dmitry Andronchik's (right) Kalitas.*


When Pispa finally saw an [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) on top of his library, he also saw [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) on Andronchik's. So he used [Codex Shredder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Codex+Shredder) on Andronchik, but Andronchik had smartly saved two fetch lands and used one to shuffle the card away. After all had resolved, the top card of Andronchik's library was a useless land, so Andronchik cracked another fetch land...and then revealed [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) on top of his library once again.


"That was great," Pispa admitted. He was in a pickle. Using [Ghoulcaller's Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghoulcaller%27s+Bell) and [Pyxis of Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyxis+of+Pandemonium) were out of the question as he needed [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) to remain on top of his library. The fight over the top card of Andronchik's library ultimately concluded with Pispa sacrificing [Lantern of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+of+Insight) itself, leaving the new top card in the dark.


"Fingers crossed," he said. It was of no use. Kalitas brought Pispa to 5, [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and a topdecked [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) brought him down to 0.


"I missed 1 life off of [Inventors' Fair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventors%27+Fair)," Pispa lamented. "With it I probably win this game. My teammate and I started talking, which we shouldn't have done. I got distracted and then I missed the trigger. This will haunt me forever."


For the second game Pispa kept a hand with two [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay)s, two [Lantern of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+of+Insight)s, [Inventors' Fair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventors%27+Fair), [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter), and [Botanical Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Botanical+Sanctum). Andronchik had [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void), [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), and two lands.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/2016wmc/WMC-20161119-2271.jpg)  
*Finland National Champion Lauri Pispa seemed happy with his opening hand.*


Early on, only Andronchik got an advantage from the Lanterns shining their light, as he was able to optimize his draws via fetch land use. When Pispa was about to draw a fourth black spell he couldn't cast, he sacrificed one [Lantern of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+of+Insight). He still ended up having to use [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) on his own [Inventors' Fair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inventors%27+Fair) to get a Swamp and kill [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant).


Over the next couple of turns, Pispa found [Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) and [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge). Andronchik of course had [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) to deal with both, necessarily in that order, but he was still missing a third land. This was the only thing that kept Andronchik at bay, so Pispa sacrificed his final [Lantern of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+of+Insight) when he saw [Twilight Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Mire).


Andronchik found a land anyway. He then cast one of the few creatures to get around [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) in [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), flashed back [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), and reduced Pispa to zero artifacts. To add insult to injury, Pispa also lost [Glimmervoid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid). He never recovered.


More things happened—none of them good for Pispa, like [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) almost going ultimate and [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) destroying another [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge)—but this match was over long before the final point of damage was dealt.


**Dmitry Andronchik defeated Lauri Pispa 2-0.**


Seat B: Matti Kuisma (Dredge) vs. Ihar Klionski (Bant Eldrazi)
==============================================================


The first game was Dredge doing was Dredge does best. [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) in combination with [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll), multiple [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)s, and [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam) made for one very noninteractive affair. It didn't help that Klionski never found a third land.


The second game was all about [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace). Kuisma wasn't able to develop any kind of board presence before the enchantment struck, and didn't find an answer afterward.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/2016wmc/WMC-20161119-2282.jpg)  
*Ihar Klionski's [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) effectively locked Matti Kuisma (center) out of the game.*


Now all hinged on the outcome of the third game in this battle of Zombies versus aliens, basically a rematch of the *Eldritch Moon* storyline. Who would advance to the semifinals? The players gave their opening hands due consideration. Klionski's didn't include [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) or [Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage), but it did have two [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple)s, [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner), and [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope). In the absence of a sideboard card, this probably was as good as it could get, so Klionski kept.


Kuisma, meanwhile, had to mulligan his first hand and was given the following six in return: two lands, [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam), [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives), [Lightning Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe), and [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflagrate). With no way to dredge, this was another mulligan. [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam), [Lightning Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe), [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim), and [Copperline Gorge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperline+Gorge) had to do.


Klionski managed to cast [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) on turn two and dredged into [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa), [Golgari Grave-Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll), and [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) on turn three. He cast [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) again, played the land, and chose not to return [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast). Rather he waited until Klionski had summoned [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) on his turn three. He sacrificed the fetch land, put [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast)'s trigger on the stack, and discarded [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam) to [Lightning Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe).


The board now held [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner) plus two Eldrazi Scions against [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam). Klionski was the first to add another creature in [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer), while Kuisma dredged into further [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam)s but missed the means to retrieve them. Klionski brought Kuisma down to 5 and summoned another [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner).


Kuisma wasn't done for yet, however. He finally found a [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), cast [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) from his hand and [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflagrate) from his graveyard, and ended the turn with three [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam)s and one [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) tapped and [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) and [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) untapped to his opponent's [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer), [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), and 1/1 token.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/2016wmc/WMC-20161119-2275.jpg)  
*With everything hinging upon this final game, Ihar Klionski (right) and his teammates considered every play very carefully.*


Now Kuisma was threatening lethal damage and had himself enough blockers to survive. The Finnish had overcome all misfortune, had turned this game around, and were poised to erupt into cheers to celebrate their semi—


Wait, what was that? Klionski cast the aptly named [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope), tapped both blockers, and attacked for the win!


Now it was Belarus celebrating while Finland sat with hung heads. "Even [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) wouldn't have been enough," they complained. "Only [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) or [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer)."


"Usually, if your opponent doesn't have a sideboard card you win this matchup," said Kuisma. "But I mulled to five and had a really slow draw. I mean, I spend my turn two playing [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) *for nothing*."


**Ihar Klionski defeated Matti Kuisma 2-1.**


**Team Belarus defeated Team Finland 2-1 and advanced to the semifinals!**
