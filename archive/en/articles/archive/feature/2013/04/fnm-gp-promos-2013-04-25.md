You go to Friday Night **Magic**, right? Of course you do! And by going, you know that one of the reasons (aside from playing **Magic**) is to get the awesome FNM Promos we release each month.

Friday Night **Magic** obviously isn't the only way we put out awesome alternative art promos; another place we do it is at Grand Prix tournaments. The first Grand Prix promo of 2013 was the always scary [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), but we're fast approaching the mid-point of the year. In fact, given the amazing attendance for Grand Prix tournaments this year, we're moving up the day we change the promo. So starting June 8, 2013, with Grand Prix Gothenburg and Grand Prix Providence, we will begin handing out the new [All is Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+is+Dust).
