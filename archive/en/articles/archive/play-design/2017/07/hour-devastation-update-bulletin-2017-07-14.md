Welcome, initiates! We're coming to you live from the ruins of the Trial of Knowledge. There are swarms of Horrors and locusts outside, but in here we have air conditioning, lemonade, and plenty of books to read while the world ends in unspeakable calamities. We also have some changes to rules and Oracle text from the *Archenemy: Nicol Bolas* and *Hour of Devastation* releases for you to enjoy to take your mind off the obliteration of society.


This update is fairly light, so please help yourself to a strawberry smoothie and have a seat in our comfortable deck chairs by the mana pool while we begin.
