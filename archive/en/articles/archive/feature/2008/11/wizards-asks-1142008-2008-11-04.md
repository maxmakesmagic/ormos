*How did you first get involved with **Magic**?*


![Tom Lapille](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_tomlapille.jpg)**Tom Lapille:** I inherited a love of games from my dad. As early as I can remember his extended family gatherings included card games like gin and euchre as well as tons of random board games. I don't know if it was genetics or osmosis, but I was quickly hooked too. I went through phases of liking tons of different games, including classics like Scrabble and Othello, some newer board games, and later various video games.


I was right at the end of my first chess phase when a friend in seventh grade introduced me to **Magic**, a game that happened to neatly address all of the issues that I had with chess at the time. Chess's onboard complexity combined with perfect information made me feel obligated to calculate a lot, and that wasn't very fun. I was also frustrated when I started working to improve my play and discovered five hundred years of opening theory that I would have to learn if I wanted to be a serious player. (I've always been about as Spikey as they come.) **Magic** was a breath of fresh air in that the onboard complexity was greatly reduced and the game updated itself regularly so that it was always fresh, and therefore I was happy to jump ship.


My first question, of course, was "Where do I find **Magic** books?" which earned me strange looks by my **Magic**-playing friends. I eventually stumbled onto the new-defunct website The Dojo which was the best source on the internet for **Magic** strategy in 1997. I went to a store and built a crude mono-red attack deck out of their five-cent common box. I was the only person in my school who knew what a mana curve was, so I started holding my own almost immediately. The combination of that and the fact that **Magic** was totally awesome in general made me want to keep playing.


I've been through phases of playing lots of other games between then and now, but the **Magic** phase never stopped and has been going for 11 years and counting. That's over half of my life to this point, which completely blows my mind.
