Ryan was a member of the* **Magic** 2013 *design team and [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) is one of his card designs. Ryan is also the lead on the* [***Kaijudo** TCG*](http://www.kaijudo.com/)*. He's got a great eye for story and I'm excited to feature him in Uncharted Realms. Thanks for reading!*
