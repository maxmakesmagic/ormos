Standard is changing a lot these days. And fast. From the Pro Tour via Grand Prix Toronto to Tokyo and New York, decks were discarded and developed almost on a weekly basis. We asked some of the more notable players in attendance at Grand Prix Manchester: What was the most important development in Standard these past few weeks? In which way did the metagame change? And how did that influence your deck choice?

**Patrick Dickmann, Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* semifinalist:**  Humans, though I don't know why, have all but disappeared. Naya is on the rise, acting somewhat like an heir to the green-white token deck. Four-Color Rites became big, and all the different black midrange or control decks with [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) and [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) gained in popularity. Kalitas and the lack of real aggro made me switch from Abzan Rites to Four-Color Rites.

**Christoffer Larsen, three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor:** I settled on Green-White. People tried to beat it in testing, but it remained good in almost any matchup. Then Martin Müller came along with his mono-blue Jace's Sanctum deck and everything went to hell ...

**Petr Sochůrek, champion of Grand Prix Paris 2016:** The format has become more diverse in recent weeks and as a result decks aren't trying to beat certain other decks anymore. Which means that the strongest strategy, [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), is good again.

**Joel Larsson, champion of Pro Tour *Magic Origins*:**  Black midrange/control has been growing in popularity and that's what I based my deck choice on.

**Craig Jones, finalist at Pro Tour Honolulu 2006:** Humans was ousted by Green-White Tokens which was in turn defeated by White-Black Control. I thought Ramp was well positioned between all of them, but the deck is just too inconsistent.
