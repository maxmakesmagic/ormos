[_metadata_:description]:- "At 9-2, both players in this closing match of the first draft of the day knew that only a win could keep them in contention for the Top 8. On the left, Seth Manfield. Two of his four Grand Prix Top 8s resulted in trophies on the mantelpiece, at Daytona Beach 2007, and Kansas City 2013. On the right, Ari Lax. His Grand Prix career is arguably even better, with seven Top 8s culminating in a title-winning run at Grand Prix Toronto 2013. While he's still waiting for a Pro Tour Top 8, he's been as close as you can possibly get, finishing 9th at Pro Tour Return to Ravnica 2012."

 At 9-2, both players in this closing match of the first draft of the day knew that only a win could keep them in contention for the Top 8. On the left, Seth Manfield. Two of his four Grand Prix Top 8s resulted in trophies on the mantelpiece, at Daytona Beach 2007, and Kansas City 2013. On the right, Ari Lax. His Grand Prix career is arguably even better, with seven Top 8s culminating in a title-winning run at Grand Prix Toronto 2013. While he's still waiting for a Pro Tour Top 8, he's been as close as you can possibly get, finishing 9th at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* 2012.
