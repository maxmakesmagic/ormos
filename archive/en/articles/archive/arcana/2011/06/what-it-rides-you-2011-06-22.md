What It Rides Is Up to You

Have you seen [Scythe Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+Specter) from the ***Magic: the Gathering** Commander* [Devour for Power](/en/articles/archive/magic-gathering-commander-decklists-2011-06-14) deck? No? Take a look:


![Scythe Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scythe+Specter)
  
That's some Specter! Not only does it make your combat-damage-riddled opponent discard a card (like most of the other [seventeen Specters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Specter%22%5D) in **Magic**) it makes *all* opponents discard, no matter which opponent in a multiplayer game took the damage! Then, when all the discarding dust has settled, the person who discarded the card with the highest converted mana cost—or persons if there is a tie for the highest—loses that much life! Good thing I like to hold onto lands to trick my opponents into thinking I have some type of counterspell.\*


But what's the specter riding? Is that some type of insect-mandible type dragon-drake-elemental creature? Let's take a look at the art:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/738_ScytheSpecterArt.jpg)[Scythe Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+Specter) | Art by [Vincent Proce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Vincent+Proce%22%5D)


And the art description:



> Color: Black creature   
>  Location: Strangely colored sky   
>  Action: Show a specter, which in Magic is a ghostly, faceless, hooded figure that rides an undead flying creature of some kind. This specter carries a huge, evil-looking scythe, and its tattered cloak billows out behind it. What it rides is up to you\*\* -- could be an undead or skeletal drake or bird, or something much stranger (as long as it flies).   
>  Focus: the specter   
>  Mood: A sower of nightmares
> 
> 
> 

Uh, that's a burning cluster of undead, humanoid creatures with wings! Ewww.\*\*\*


If that wasn't enough, the specter, along with the winged, un-dead cluster, are flying through a cavern of perturbed-looking, possibly dead creatures! Presumably representing all those cards your opponents just discarded.


Zoom in and enhance!


Let's see, there is a snarly wolf and a sleeping lamb:\*\*\*\*

...an amphibious, big-mouthed creature in need of a dentist:

...an angry skull:

...a cloud skull:

...and a head soon to be a skull:

Does somebody have a copy of [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) I can borrow?


\* Did I just say that? Now everyone knows my secret.   
 \*\* "What it rides is up to you"! Remind me to never go out in the woods alone with Vincent Proce.   
 \*\*\* Ewww here meaning "awesome."   
 \*\*\*\* All lambs are sleeping, not dead, unless otherwise noted. C'mon, they're lambs.
