**Raise Your Banner**
Five warrior clans vie for dominance on the field of battle on the plane of Tarkir, where ancient tyrannical dragons have been hunted to extinction.


Who doesn't want to be a khan of Tarkir when they grow up? No one, that's who. I'll tell you what though—it's not easy. There are some pretty stiff prerequisites depending on which clan you're going out for. At the very least, you have to be comfortable deckbuilding in three colors. Whichever clan you aspire to lead one day, the title of *Khans of Tarkir* Champion is a resume necessity.


That's right, the *Khans of Tarkir* Championships are coming!


True khans can weaponize their surroundings at a moment's notice, no matter where they may be; [bugs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386589), [bodies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386531), or even your [bear hands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386484)—especially your [bear hands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386484)—can be useful when your back is to the wall. That's why a khan-hopeful could learn a thing or two in the *Khans of Tarkir* Limited Championship Qualifiers. The Limited Qualifiers begin on Wednesday, November 12, and run through Tuesday, November 18, so don't miss out on this valuable opportunity!


Being a khan also requires solid leadership abilities, coordination, and a strategic mind. The [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade) didn't reach that level of precision and expertise overnight, that's for sure, and none of them are even close to being ready for khan-status. The *Khans of Tarkir* Standard Championship Qualifiers will give you a chance to show your potential as a tactician, gauging your possible opponents, and preparing yourself for threats before you even sign up to compete. The Standard Qualifiers start on Wednesday, November 19, and run through Tuesday, November 25, so start preparing now.


Getting your *Khans of Tarkir* Championship invitation is just the beginning—your prerequisite to get you into the big leagues. If it was the through Limited play that you received your invitation, the *Khans of Tarkir* Limited Championship Finals begin on Saturday, November 22, at 8:00 a.m. If you climbed through the ranks via the Standard Qualifier, the *Khans of Tarkir* Standard Championship Finals are at 8:00 a.m., Saturday, November 29. Whether you rise to the Championship Finals through Limited or Standard Qualifiers, good luck!
