It's time to see another finished piece of *Ninth Edition* art. You chose Puddnhead's sketch for [Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact) during the [Selecting *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/wrapup) promotion. Let's see the final piece!


First, a look back at that sketch:


  
*[Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact) sketch by Puddnhead*



And here's the final art you'll see in packs of *Ninth*:


  
*Ninth Edition [Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact) art by Puddnhead*



 ...Unsettling. Sanity-threatening. Vaguely *beckoning*. 


 In other words, we love it.


 Take a minute to look -- the final art is *rich* with detail that wasn't in the first sketch, and plus, it makes you go a little crazy. Try it. 


And be sure to tune in next Monday to see how Pete Venters's [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) turned out!
