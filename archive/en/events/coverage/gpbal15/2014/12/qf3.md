With his passion for Commander and community inclusion, you'll find plenty of opportunity each week to share your thoughts about everyone's favorite casual format. 






 It was a different format when Gerard Fabiano last won a Limited Grand Prix. In Montreal, *Theros* was the dominant set and a double helping of [Celestial Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Archon) that led him to rise as champion. Affable and friendly, Fabiano was a talkative type impossible to keep pace with if you let him run away with it.



Conversely, Pro Tour Dragon's Maze champion Craig Wescoe was a quieter player at least by Fabiano standards. Known for aggressive strategies and fast decks, his trademark choice of Plains was indeed in his deck for the match.


The question wasn't ever would he play it, but how many would he need.



**The Games**




[Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) was the tone Wescoe set with his first turn, following it up with [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) on the next. Fabiano used [Sultai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Charm) and [Sultai Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Flayer) to slow things down, but [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) and [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher) let Wescoe drop Fabiano down to 11 life. [Hooting Mandrills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooting+Mandrills) was the second big blocker Fabian laid out.




 Wescoe nudged in with his troops a little more, but Fabiano calculated the different options of removal that might take down his defenders. Arc Lighting was the way Wescoe cleared out the blockers, adding a morph to his remaining Goblin token. Fabiano went on a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) to find what he needed, but it left him open to an attack from Wescoe: The unmorphed [Efreet Weaponmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Efreet+Weaponmaster) put Fabiano down to 8 life.
