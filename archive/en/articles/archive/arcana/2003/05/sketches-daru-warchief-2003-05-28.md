This week's "Sketches" focuses on Tim Hildebrandt's [Daru Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Warchief) from *Scourge*. 

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Color: White  
 Location: Daru plains   
 Action: Show a refugee soldier. Around its neck is a pearl medallion on a chain which designates this creature as a leader among its own kind. Other soldiers can be shown rallying around their leader."  


As you may know, [Daru Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Warchief) is one of a cycle of creatures that reduce the mana cost of creatures of their fellow creature type, which were called the "Minibosses" in playtest. [Daru Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Warchief) is the Soldier version, so it was called the Soldier Miniboss.

### 2. Sketch

Here is a preliminary sketch of the "Soldier Miniboss" submitted by Tim Hildebrandt. The sketch (and the card's flavor text) point out the lack of certain facial features on *Scourge* soldiers; the influence of the [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) has mutated them such that they have lost their ears and mouths. They have also physically merged with their weapons -- these soldiers are focused on doing *battle*.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece, a fairly direct translation of the sketch to canvas. In this blown-up image, you can see the other soldiers in the background that were mentioned in the art description.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
