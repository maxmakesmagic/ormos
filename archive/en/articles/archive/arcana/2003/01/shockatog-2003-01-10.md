![shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shock)Many people have guessed it, and now we'll confirm it: the creature being hit by the lightning in the *Onslaught* version of [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) is in fact the lovable [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog).


Ed Beard's original [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) art was moved to another card in the set, and when asked to do another version, he decided to have a little fun and show [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)—by that time already the scourge of the tournament scene—getting fried.


Of course, [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ing a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) is not good for much in game terms, but it's nice to see the little sucker suffer.
