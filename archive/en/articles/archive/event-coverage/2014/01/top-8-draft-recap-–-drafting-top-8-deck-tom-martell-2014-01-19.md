Top 8 Draft Recap – Drafting a Top 8 Deck with Tom Martell
==========================================================



 Posted in **Event Coverage**
 on January 19, 2014 










Tom Martell is currently ranked 13th in the world on the Top 25 Pro Rankings. This is Martell's fifth Grand Prix Top 8. Coming into the Top 8 Draft here in Sacramento, Martell strongly favored Blue/White Heroic as an archetype. Let's see how things went for the Pro Tour *Gatecrash* Champion.


The first pack had [Triad of Fates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triad+of+Fates), but spending a first pick on a two-color card is a risky proposition. [Staunch-Hearted Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staunch-Hearted+Warrior) and [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) made their way to the front of the pack and Martell eventually settled on [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid).

Pack 1 Pick 1: [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid)



The next pack had [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide), [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon), and God's Willing. [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) was likely the strongest card in the pack, but taking one of the others would keep Martell's options open. God's Willing ended up being the pick.


Pack 1 Pick 2: [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing)


The third pick offered up [Whip of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), an absolute bomb. Martell was surprised to see the card this late and the [Keepsake Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon) in the pack led him to believe that Black was very open.


Pack 1 Pick 3: [Whip of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos)


Pack 1 Pick 4: [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker)


Pack 1 Pick 5: [Scourgemark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourgemark)


Pack 1 Pick 6: [Fleshmad Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed)


Pack 1 Pick 7: [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing)


Pack 1 Pick 8: [Returned Phalanx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx)


Pack 1 Pick 9: [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos)


Pack 1 Pick 10: [Felhide Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Minotaur)


Pack 1 Pick 11: [Traveling Philosopher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher)


Pack 1 Pick 12: [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)


Pack 1 Pick 13: [Setessan Battle Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Battle+Priest)


The next pack didn't offer up a lot in the way of Black, White, or Blue cards, but [Ordeal of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Erebos) and [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) came to the front of the pack. Martell's aggressive style makes [Ordeal of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Erebos) a very strong card in the decks he likes to draft.


Pack 2 Pick 1: [Ordeal of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Erebos)


Martell's next choice was between a third copy of God's Willing and [Insatiable Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insatiable+Harpy). Martell decided to pick up the lifelinking flyer that combos nicely with bestow creatures and Scrougemark over a third copy of the one-mana instead.


Pack 2 Pick 2: [Insatiable Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insatiable+Harpy)


[Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict), and [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) were all reasonable third picks. Martell eventually decided that [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) was the best choice for a deck like his that wanted to be tapping out on most turns.


Pack 2 Pick 3: [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock)


Pack 2 Pick 4: [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite)


Pack 2 Pick 5: [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary)


Pack 2 Pick 6: [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones)


Pack 2 Pick 7: [Battlewise Valor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Valor)


Pack 2 Pick 8: [Lagonna-Band Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder)


Pack 2 Pick 9: [Deathbellow Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathbellow+Raider)


Pack 2 Pick 10: [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos)


Pack 2 Pick 11: [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath)


Pack 2 Pick 12: [March of the Returned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Returned)


Pack 2 Pick 13: [Scourgemark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourgemark)


Pack 2 Pick 14: [Fade into Antiquity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fade+into+Antiquity)


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wingsteed+Rider)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider)

Martell's third pack had exactly the common he was looking for. [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) was an easy pick over [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict).



Pack 3 Pick 1: [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider)


Pack 3 Pick 2: [Lagonna-Band Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder)


Martell got an absolute gift in the form of [Phalanx Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) in his third pick of the third pack.


Pack 3 Pick 3: [Phalanx Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader)


Pack 3 Pick 4: [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide)


Pack 3 Pick 5: [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite)


Pack 3 Pick 6: [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught)


Pack 3 Pick 7: [Traveling Philosopher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher)


Pack 3 Pick 8: [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid)


Pack 3 Pick 10: [Rescue from the Underworld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rescue+from+the+Underworld)


Pack 3 Pick 11: [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form)


Pack 3 Pick 13: [Asphodel Wanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphodel+Wanderer)

Tom Martell may have wanted a Blue/White Heroic deck, but he was passed a very strong Black/White deck with some incredibly aggressive draws. Stay tuned for coverage of Grand Prix Sacramento to find out how Martell and his Black/White deck fare against the rest of the Top 8.
