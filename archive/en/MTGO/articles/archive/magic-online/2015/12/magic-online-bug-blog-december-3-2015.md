Known Issues List Updates
=========================


In this week's bug blog, we have a few new known issues to add to the *Legendary Cube* and *Commander (2015 Edition)* known issues. You can also find a list of fixes that went out in the Wednesday, December 2 *Magic Online* deployment.


The Known Issues List has been updated, so refer to that for the most up-to-date statuses on *Magic Online* known issues. If you want to see the history of fixed known issues, refer to the [archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-fixed-known-issues-archive).




Legendary Cube Known Issues
---------------------------





**Gameplay**


* Cardset | [Caged Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caged+Sun)’s mana ability incorrectly doesn't trigger when a land is tapped for an ability that produces more than one mana.
* Cardset | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability.
* Cardset | All legendary creature cards in all zones owned by a player who controls a [Heroes' Podium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) incorrectly receive the power/toughness bonus from its first ability.
* Cardset | [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi)'s ability does not cause creature cards to be exiled instead of being put into the graveyard.
* Cardset | [Myriad Landscape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)’s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield.
* Cardset | [Kurkesh, Onakke Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurkesh%2C+Onakke+Ancient) does not copy activated abilities of artifacts that sacrifice as part of their activation cost.
* Cardset | Cards cast with conspire that require a player to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast, such as [Life's Legacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life%27s+Legacy) and [Momentous Fall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall), incorrectly look at the power and toughness of the last creature clicked for conspire.
* Cardset | Copying [All Suns' Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) sometimes causes a crash.
* Cardset | Casting [Ray of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command) without paying its mana cost, via a spell or ability such as cascade or [Mizzix's Mastery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzix%27s+Mastery), incorrectly requires the player to pay the mana cost.



---






Newly Added Known Issues
------------------------





**Gameplay**


* Cardset | [Villainous Wealth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)'s prompt box text incorrectly suggests that the caster must cast all appropriate exiled spells. This is a display issue only. The Cancel button allows the player to continue without casting remaining spells.

**Client**


* Deckbuilding | Players cannot move cards to empty columns when using Pile View to view a deck.



---






Fixes Deployed December 2
-------------------------





**Gameplay**


* Duel scene | Images associated with certain triggers no longer appear to untap when put onto the stack.
* Cardset | Casting “pitch” cards—cards that involve an alternative casting cost that involves a player exiling a number of cards from his or her hand, such as [Soul Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Spike) or [Fury of the Horde](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+of+the+Horde)—once again require the correct number of cards to be exiled to pay those costs.
* Cardset | Prompt box text for [Seal of the Guildpact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+the+Guildpact)’s replacement ability has been corrected.
* Cardset | Confluence spells from the *Commander (2015 Edition)* set now display proper text formatting while on the stack.
* Cardset | [Illusory Ambusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Ambusher) and numerous other cards with abilities that trigger upon being dealt damage now correctly display blue text indicating the amount of damage dealt.
* Duel Scene | Players can no longer right-click on the commander of an opponent and be presented with a non-functional context menu with zone change options.
* Cardset | Colorless mana in a player’s mana pool is no longer automatically applied to a converge spell’s mana cost.
* Cardset | Using [Jace, Telepath Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound)’s second loyalty ability on a split card in the graveyard now correctly causes that card to be exiled after being cast.

**Client**


* Collection | Nonfunctional prerelease objects for past events have been removed from players' collections.
* General | When players start a chat, toast messaging now properly appears only once.
* Collection | Decks and binders can once again be deleted from the Collection Scene.
* General | League matches are no longer suspended three and a half hours before scheduled *Magic Online* downtimes. Players can now enjoy League matches until one hour and seventeen minutes before the downtime is scheduled.
* General | If a player changes the time on his or her computer while in an event, the Round Time clock is no longer affected.
* General | Several bugs not listed elsewhere that caused crashes have been resolved.
* Duel Scene | Manifested premium cards no longer obscure the artist name in zoom view.

Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
--------------------------------------





We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature.
   | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters.
   |
| Duel Scene | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don’t show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. | The cards are properly identified in the game log.
   |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. | You must start by ordering blockers for the left most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right.
   |
| Duel Scene | Graveyard order appears incorrectly in expanded or undocked views.
   | Keeping the graveyard in small, undocked “preview” (default) window will display order correctly for cards like [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) and [Sphinx’s Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%E2%80%99s+Tutelage).
   |
| Duel Scene | Zooming in on a card exiled by a land with hideaway shows an additional basic Swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the Swamp using hideaway. | Right-clicking on the exiled land will display it correctly. |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error.
   | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If a player suspects this is happening, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player turns a creature face up during their opponent's end step.
   | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Upcoming Tournaments schedule does not appear on the Home screen and Scheduled Events don’t load in the Play Lobby. If this occurs, players will be unable to play in any Scheduled Event for which they are already signed up. | Closing *Magic Online* and signing back in will address this issue. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. This will also prevent a toast message from notifying the player that the next round has begun. | As a temporary workaround, the Return to Game button found on that screen should address this issue. |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results.
   | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues.
   |
| Trade | If a player opens a booster pack that is in their active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade.
   | Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.

| Gameplay Known Issues |
| Cardset | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability. |
| Cardset | All legendary creature cards in all zones owned by a player who controls a [Heroes' Podium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) incorrectly receive the power/toughness bonus from its first ability. |
| Cardset | [Anafenza, the Foremost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) incorrectly exiles creature tokens. |
| Cardset | [Atarka's Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command)'s first mode doesn't appear in the Effect area after it resolves.  |
| Cardset | [Caged Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caged+Sun)’s mana ability incorrectly doesn't trigger when a land is tapped for an ability that produces more than one mana. |
| Cardset | Cards cast with conspire that require a player to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast, such as [Life's Legacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life%27s+Legacy) and [Momentous Fall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall), incorrectly look at the power and toughness of the last creature clicked for conspire. |
| Cardset | Casting [Ray of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command) without paying its mana cost, via a spell or ability such as cascade or [Mizzix's Mastery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzix%27s+Mastery), incorrectly requires the player to pay the mana cost. |
| Cardset | [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)'s second ability can incorrectly be used to cast face-down creatures of the chosen creature type.  |
| Cardset | Copying [All Suns' Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) sometimes causes a crash. |
| Cardset | [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) doesn't allow the player to fail to find a card when they are not hellbent. |
| Cardset | [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi)'s ability does not cause creature cards to be exiled instead of being put into the graveyard. |
| Cardset | [Kurkesh, Onakke Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurkesh%2C+Onakke+Ancient) does not copy activated abilities of artifacts that sacrifice as part of their activation cost. |
| Cardset | [Lightning Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm)'s activated ability will sometimes let the wrong player change the target. To mitigate this issue, we suggest letting the [Lightning Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm) activated ability resolve before activating it another time. |
| Cardset | *Legendary Cube* versions of planeswalkers have minor visual irregularities. |
| Cardset | [Myriad Landscape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)’s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield. |
| Cardset | [Oblivion Sower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower)’s triggered ability incorrectly allows a player to select an face down exiled land card. |

| Cardset | [The Chain Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) does not allow Planeswalkers that enter the battlefield after activating [The Chain Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) to use their abilities twice. |
| Cardset | The game log does not display the third choice of a [Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5BConfluence%5D&set=+%5B%22Commander%202015%22%5D). |
| Cardset | [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature.  |
| Cardset | A [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) copying a creature incorrectly does not display its triggered ability in blue text. |
| Cardset | Cards that are exiled by [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) incorrectly show association arrows while in the Exiled Zone. |
| Cardset | Cards that ask a player to choose X targets, such as [Glimpse the Sun God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God), briefly indicate incorrectly that X is equal to zero when the last potential target is chosen before moving on to the cost payment step.  |
| Cardset | Casting [Sylvan Primordial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) causes the game to be locked in a multiplayer game if there are no legal targets for one player. |
| Cardset | Conceding while looking at cards with [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) reveals cards to opponent. This applies to all actions involving scry or looking at X cards. |
| Cardset | Costs that include a snow mana symbol require an additional snow mana.  |
| Cardset | Delayed triggered ability of [Otherworldly Journey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey) has missing association arrows with the exiled card.  |
| Cardset | If [Balance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) causes a player to sacrifice lands, that player won't be able to activate abilities of permanents for the rest of that phase.  |
| Cardset | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly. |
| Cardset | In some scenarios, casting [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch) crashes *Magic Online*. |
| Cardset | Mana generated from [Crucible of the Spirit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) must be added to the pool before a player casts a Dragon spell.  |
| Cardset | [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker)’s mana ability cannot be activated during the mana ability step in paying a cost for a spell or ability.  |
| Cardset | Multiple cards being put into a graveyard simultaneously will be displayed in the graveyard in an incorrect order. This is a display issue only. *Magic Online* treats the cards as if they were in the correct order, but this can cause confusion for cards like [Sphinx’s Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%E2%80%99s+Tutelage) or [Lion's Eye Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond).  |
| Cardset | Players are unable to drag-and-drop cards to split them into piles when prompted to do so by a card like [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Cards can no longer be dragged from one pile to another in these scenarios, but players can move cards to another pile by single-clicking on the card. |
| Cardset | Several *Battle for Zendikar* promo cards appear with the incorrect set symbol. |
| Cardset | Spells that target [Thunderbreak Regent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) more than once incorrectly trigger [Thunderbreak Regent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)'s ability twice. |
| Cardset | Under rare circumstances, a player who controls two creatures that can’t attack alone (such as [Bonded Construct](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)) but must attack with one of them will be able to attack with only that creature rather than being required to attack with both. Under even more rare circumstances, that creature will instead turn on its controller and attack that player on the next turn. We recommend that players keep their Bonded Constructs on tight leashes. |
| Cardset | [Villainous Wealth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)'s prompt box text incorrectly suggests that the caster must cast all appropriate exiled spells. This is a display issue only. The Cancel button allows the player to continue without casting remaining spells. |
| Cardset | [Void Winnower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) incorrectly allows players to cast face-down spells. |
| Cardset | [Void Winnower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) incorrectly prohibits players from casting spells that have both an even converted mana cost and a variable in the mana cost. For example, a player whose opponent controls a [Void Winnower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) is incorrectly prohibited from casting [Rolling Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) or [Nourishing Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal), even if the value chosen for X would result in a spell with an odd converted mana cost. Even if a player cannot even, they should be able to odd. |
| Cardset | When [Chasm Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chasm+Guide)’s triggered ability is triggered by [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), it will appear with incorrect art on the stack. |
| Cardset | When [Entreat the Angels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear. |
| Cardset | When a single player or object is chosen multiple times as the target of a [Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5BConfluence%5D&set=+%5B%22Commander%202015%22%5D), no visual indicator is present to identify the number of times each object or player is chosen. The game log will still identify the chosen target of each mode.  |
| Commander | [Mishra, Artificer Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%2C+Artificer+Prodigy) will freeze the client when used as a Commander. |
| Duel Scene | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don’t show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. These cards are properly identified in the game log. |
| Duel Scene | Colorless mana autoconsumed before special mana (e.g. from [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) and [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)). |
| Duel Scene | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. |
| Duel Scene | If a player right-clicks on the commander of an opponent, they will be presented with a non-functional context menu with zone change options. |
| Duel Scene | If a player’s spell or ability causes his or her own cards to be revealed, those cards are incorrectly not added to the player’s own Revealed Cards area. The player’s opponent should still see the revealed cards correctly. |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. |
| Duel Scene | Spells with multiple targets (such as [Silumgar's Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command), [Agony Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), etc.) sometimes lack visual indicators to show what is happening to each target.  |
| Duel Scene | The Ingest keyword ability displays extraneous text in the game log when resolving. |
| Duel Scene | The prompt box displays the incorrect color during the “scry-like” step in the new mulligan process. |
| Duel Scene | The prompt text where the card states "Choose up to X target... X is currently [#]." States 'zero' when the last valid target is clicked.  |
| Duel Scene | Trying to attach equipment to creatures that do not meet the equipment's requirement incorrectly depletes mana pool. |
| Duel Scene | Under certain rare scenarios, attacking creatures will display on the opponent’s side of the battlefield. Resizing the *Magic Online* game window resolves this display issue. |
| Duel Scene | When a card with the devoid ability is given a color (perhaps by a [Painter’s Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%E2%80%99s+Servant)), it appears with distorted art. |
| Duel Scene | When a player plays a Ravnica shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before the player decides whether to pay 2 life. |
| Duel Scene | When affects like [Parallax Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) and [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) end and creatures return to the battlefield, if one of those creatures was a [Containment Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) then all other creatures are Exiled.  |
| Duel Scene | When colorless mana is added to a player's mana pool as a result of a creature dying in combat (e.g. [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), [Su-chi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-chi)), the user is unable to spend that mana if no stop is set. |
| Duel Scene | Zooming in on a card exiled by a land with hideaway shows an additional basic Swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the Swamp using hideaway. Right-clicking on the exiled land will display it correctly. |
| General | When the "No Possible Play: Yield All" function is active, tapping [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) when it's the only land the player controls will automatically end the turn even if the mana could be spent.  |
| In certain scenarios, if a player turns a creature face up by paying its morph cost during the opponent’s end step, the last land that player tapped to pay the cost will appear to not untap during the impending untap step. This is a display issue only. The land can still be correctly tapped for mana by clicking it.  |

| Fixed Gameplay Known Issues |
| Duel scene | Images associated with certain triggers no longer appear to untap when put onto the stack. —fixed 12/2 |
| Cardset | Casting “pitch” cards—cards that involve an alternative casting cost that involves a player exiling a number of cards from his or her hand, such as [Soul Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Spike) or [Fury of the Horde](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+of+the+Horde)—once again require the correct number of cards to be exiled to pay those costs. —fixed 12/2 |
| Cardset | Prompt box text for [Seal of the Guildpact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+the+Guildpact)’s replacement ability has been corrected. —fixed 12/2 |
| Cardset | Confluence spells from the *Commander (2015 Edition)* set now display proper text formatting while on the stack. —fixed 12/2 |
| Cardset | [Illusory Ambusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Ambusher) and numerous other cards with abilities that trigger upon being dealt damage now correctly display blue text indicating the amount of damage dealt. —fixed 12/2 |
| Duel Scene | Players can no longer right-click on the commander of an opponent and be presented with a non-functional context menu with zone change options. —fixed 12/2 |
| Cardset | Colorless mana in a player’s mana pool is no longer automatically applied to a converge spell’s mana cost. —fixed 12/2 |
| Cardset | Using [Jace, Telepath Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound)’s second loyalty ability on a split card in the graveyard now correctly causes that card to be exiled after being cast. —fixed 12/2 |

| Client Known Issues |
| Chat | Players who drop from a League cannot send messages using a League game’s chat window.  |
| Collection | Adding "All but 4" can have inconsistent results depending on the version of cards in the player's collection. 
  |
| Collection | In the Collection scene, the filter for the *From the Vault: Angels* set appears out of place (above *Battle for Zendikar* instead of with the other *From the Vault* sets). |
| Collection | New decks with the same name as an existing deck cannot be saved. Deck names are not case-sensitive. Currently, attempting to create a deck with a name that differs only by case (e.g. “Mardu” and “mardu”) will not generate an error message. |
| Collection | While players are participating in a Constructed event or a League, cards from the decks in those events become locked and cannot be traded away. There is a red “locked card” indicator on these cards. This indicator incorrectly does not appear again after closing the client while remaining in the event. |
| Deckbuilding | Players cannot move cards to empty columns when using Pile View to view a deck.  |
| Duel Scene | Challenging a player directly does not allow the player to set Wins Per Match or Match Clock options. 
  |
| Duel Scene | When face down cards are given an activated ability, the art displays incorrectly on the stack when that ability is activated.
  |
| General | If a player is running *Magic Online* on a laptop connected to a second monitor, they are unable to maximize *Magic Online* on the second monitor.
  |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. This will also prevent a toast message from notifying the player that the next round has begun. As a temporary workaround, the Return to Game button found on that screen should address this issue. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Upcoming Tournaments schedule does not appear on the Home screen and Scheduled Events don’t load in the Play Lobby. If this occurs, players will be unable to play in any Scheduled Event for which they are already signed up. Closing *Magic Online* and signing back in will address this issue. |
| General | When objects are added to a player’s collection, the window displaying these objects incorrectly defaults to sorting them alphabetically and not by type of object. This keeps booster packs earned as prizes from being immediately seen.  |
| Help Scene | The Help Scene contains several minor display errors such as blank spaces and inappropriate line breaks. |
| League | A duplicate Duel Scene can be created by closing *Magic Online* and signing back in during a League match. This duplicate can be safely hidden by closing the window, but conceding in either window will concede the match.  |
| League | If a player attempts to play a match in a League before the standings load, the matchmaking dialog box will display "Stage 0" instead of the player’s actual stage number. This is a display issue only. |
| League | If a player has more than sixteen decks of a Constructed League’s format, a second scroll bar will incorrectly appear when entering the League and selecting a deck. |
| League | If a player sorts the standings in the League Details window, that sort is incorrectly not persistent once the League Details window is closed.  |
| League | The League Details window shows an incorrectly pluralized "View Your Previous Decks" button after completing a course in a Constructed League. This button will show only the deck most recently used in the League. |
| League | The player filter menu in the League Details window incorrectly displays the word “Clan” instead of the name of the player’s clan. |
| League | When a League transitions from Open (players can join, matches can be played) to Closed (players cannot join, matches can still be played), the message that informs players how much time remains until the League transitions to Completed (no more matches can be played) is not properly being sent. This information is still available in the League Details window, however.  |
| League | When rejoining a Constructed League, the "View Your Previous Decks" button is temporarily incorrectly inactive between opening the Entry Requirements dialog box and the next time the League Details window is opened.  |
| League | When viewing a League game replay, the header does not display the League ID number. Instead, it displays the match number, incorrectly labeled as an event number. |
| Limited Scene | While building a Limited deck, if a player sorts the deck under construction by converted mana cost, clicking the “Add Lands” button will return each card to the appropriate pile even if the player individually moved them to another pile. |
| Multiplayer | Dropping out of a game does not concede the game if the player is not the first one to drop out. 
  |
| Multiplayer | Multiplayer matches do not show up in a player's Game History. 
  |
| Play Lobby | Clicking the Play button in an event lobby does not take the player to the next available tournament.
  |
| Play Lobby | Paused Leagues are incorrectly not identified as such in the Play Lobby. |
| Play Lobby | The "Play" button shown when filtering the Play Lobby to display Leagues does nothing when clicked. |
| Play Lobby | The text displayed in the search bar when filtering the Play lobby to display Leagues reads “Search Constructed Tournaments Games / Players” instead of “Search Constructed League Games / Players”. Filtering for Limited Leagues will show a similar error. |
| Sideboard | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when sideboarding. 
  |
| Trade | After clicking the Submit button in a trade, if a player adds or removes cards from the trade, the trade is still incorrectly submitted from his or her trade partner’s side. Toast messaging—messages that pop up on your screen to alert you—does display in this scenario warning players that the trade proposal has changed, and each player will have an opportunity to confirm the trade before it is performed. |
| Trade | Both players clicking Submit at the exact same time in a trade can cause the trade to be cancelled. 
  |
| Trade | If a player attempts to add cards to a binder so that the binder would have more than 50,000 cards, exactly enough cards will be added to reach 50,000 though an error message will display telling the player to decrease the number of cards and try again.
   |
| Trade | If a player opens a booster pack that is in their active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade. Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.
  |
| Trade | New trade windows do not always appear in front of other windows. These windows are still accessible via the *Magic Online* program icon in the taskbar. |
| Trade | No error message is displayed when adding locked cards (such as cards used in a current League) to a trade binder. These cards are correctly not displayed to trade partners, however.  |
| Trade | Occasionally when using the Search Tool to filter a players collection, players will incorrectly receive list of cards that are unavailable when they are actually available. 
  |
| Trade | The Search Tool is not present in the Other Products tab of a trade.  |
