 Whether you're challenging a friend over lunch or attending a full-on **Magic** event, the core of the game is the same: You pit your strategic chops against someone else's. Just get a deck, play a few hands, and swap in cards until you get the right mix.


What you'll need: 




Intro Packs 

Deckbuilder's Toolkit 

Core Set Booster Packs 

Journey into Nyx 

Everything you need in one cohesive, ready-made deck plus two booster packs.
