Today we look at some concept sketches from early on in the world of *Mirrodin*. When the concept for a new block is created, **Magic** artists are tapped to illustrate R&D's ideas and flesh out the world. Here's a look at the environments portrayed on *Mirrodin's* white cards.

**Above:** A long view of the *Mirrodin* plains (illustration by Mark Tedin). White environments in *Mirrodin* are shiny and sun-colored -- silver, gold and mirrored steel. In the background on the left, you can see a large Leonin den, perhaps guarded by a [Leonin Den-Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Den-Guard)? 

**Right:**  A detail illo of the Razor Fields (illustration by Brian Snoddy). In this close-up and in the foreground of the sketch above, we can see the sharp metal grasses of the Razor Fields, literally [Plains4](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Plains4) jutting from the ground. Denizens of the plains harvest these blades to create weapons and tools (e.g. [Leonin Bladetrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bladetrap)).

**Left:** Here's a settlement (illustration by Mark Tedin) of white-aligned humans, the Aurioks. Aurioks are wiry and resourceful (see [Auriok Steelshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Steelshaper)) -- their construction appears more makeshift than the Leonin den. This illustration features a lookout tower on top of the building, and on the right, a "tuft" of razor grass.
