![Outta Left Field](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsea04/fm2_1.jpg)The legendary Kai Budde is from Germany, although when it comes to Team Limited, many people think he and the Phoenix Foundation play on a different planet. The Phoenix Foundation's second-round matchup was against Outta Left Field, a squad comprised of solid Florida pros which has been together for two other Team Pro Tours (finishing 13th at Boston two years ago, while not making day 2 last year). Budde's team, on the other hand, needs little introduction, as they have made the Top 4 of every Team Pro Tour since 2001. Things have not gone perfectly so far for the Germans on this day, however, as they started off the tournament with a round 1 loss. A second loss would still leave them with the possibility of making day 2, but might doom their hopes of returning for yet another Sunday appearance.


### Game 1 (Seat A)


Budde kept an opening hand of [Leonin Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage), [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem), [Skyhunter Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Prowler), [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) and some land, and drew first blood with the Prowler, and followed with the Battlemage and then the Golem. Bret Herring's board, on the other hand, was a bit short on tempo, as he played five [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and [Scythe of the Wretched](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+of+the+Wretched) before casting an unimprinted [Mirror Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem). Both players got a chuckle as Herring lamented, "Worst [Mirror Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem) EVER." The Scythe equipped the six-mana 3/4, and an [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) found its way into play for Herring, but Budde crushed the Golem with [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman), and Herring scooped up his cards and headed to game 2 with the hope he could draw some early creatures.


While Dirk Baberowski went down a game in the C seat to Wade Maraj (Marco Blume and Scott Molasky were still playing game 1 in seat B), Budde and Herring shuffled up for Game 2.


Seat A: Budde 1 - Herring 0  

Seat B: Blume 0 - Molasky 1  

Seat C: Baberowski 0 - Maraj 1


### Game 2 (Seat A)


A [Leonin Den-Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Den-Guard) and [Yotian Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) for Herring meant he had a considerably better early board than last game, while all Budde could do this time was cast a [Leonin Scimitar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) and a [Vulshok Morningstar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Morningstar). [Deconstruct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct) on Herring's Bola rid the German of the troublesome equipment with enough mana left over to cast [Leonin Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage), instantly stabilizing the board. [Skyhunter Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Prowler) entered the fray for Budde and turned into a rather intimidating flier when equipped. [Soul Nova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Nova) on the Prowler was exactly what Herring needed to clean up what looked to be an uncomfortable situationâ€¦until Budde cast [Razor Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier). Herring's army of Den-Guard, Yoti, and [Stalking Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) looked weak when compared to Budde's crew of Battlemage, Prowler and [Tel-Jilad Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Exile) and the situation deteriorated significantly when Budde cast [Razormane Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razormane+Masticore), or as he called it, "kitty cat."


[Blinding Beam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam) from Herring slowed Budde's charge, and [Altar's Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Light) during Budde's upkeep (but before his draw) killed the kitty, but Herring's life was dwindling rapidly, and a late [Titanium Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem) proved far too little to stem the tide.


Dirk evened up the game count for his match, while Marco lost, meaning a possible 0-2 start for Phoenix Foundation would hinge on game 3 in the C seat.


Seat A: Budde 2 - Herring 0  

Seat B: Blume 0 - Molasky 2  

Seat C: Baberowski 1 - Maraj 1


### Game 3 (Seat C)


Maraj (player C for Left Field) kept his first seven, as Baberowski was forced to toss his hand back. Maraj drew first blood with an attack of [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) and [Sylvok Explorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Explorer), while Baberowski swung back for five with his [Nim Shrieker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker). [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) was placed in the Shrieker's path, as Baberowski equipped the Shrieker with a three-counter Opaline Bracer and kept it back to black, only to watch it get blown out of the sky by [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) at the end of his turn. Maraj followed this monster play with a [Goblin Dirigible](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dirigible), increasing the pressure on Baberowski, who was sitting dead at the moment with a hand full of blue cards and no [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).


![Phoenix Foundation](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsea04/fm2_2.jpg)He finally found one on the top of is deck and cast [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard), equipping it with the Bracers and passing the turn. Maraj cast another Berserker and swung with the team, losing the Dirigible in the process, but dropping Baberowski to one. [Vedalken Engineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer) and a second [Ancient Den](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Den) were not the play Baberowski was looking for, as Maraj attacked again for the final point of life.


Final: Outta Left Field 2 - Phoenix Foundation 1  

Seat A: Budde 2-0  

Seat B: Molasky 2-0  

Seat C: Maraj 2-1
