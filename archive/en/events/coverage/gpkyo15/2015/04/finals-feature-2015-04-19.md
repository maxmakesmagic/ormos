For making the finals in his first Grand Prix top 8, Kazuya Murakami seemed surprisingly calm as he sat down to the table. He had reason to be calm. He ran the tables with a Miracle deck of his own creation. More aggressive than most, it ran both [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) along with the standard [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)-[Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) combo.


His opponent, Yūta Takahashi, was also playing Miracles, but his version was quite different from Murakami. The only creatures he had in his main deck were a singleton [Venser, Shaper Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant) and a pair of one of his favorite faeries: [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). Those two creatures treated him well thus far in the tournament. Venser allowed him to have a main deck answer to OmniTell decks. [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) worked as fit many roles in his deck: it disrupted his opponents when necessary, smoothed out his draws, and, much of the time, attacked for the win.


While both players had access to the devastating [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)-[Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) combo, only one of them could hold the trophy at the end of the tournament.

The Games
=========


Play started off with a first turn [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) for both players. When Murakami attempted to cast [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) on his second turn Takahashi blurted out "Really?!"


Takahashi attempted to counter it with a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), but Murakami had a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) of his own. On Murakami's following turn he cast and resolved a [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) which netted him a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


Takahashi took a look at his top three cards and said, "I have a game plan!" He Miracled out a [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) during his draw step. With no six-mana card on the top of his library, Murakami was forced to put his [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) on the bottom of his library.


Murakami simply drew a second copy of [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) off the top and cast it. While he only had the one [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) to fetch out of his deck, the newly minted 1/2 allowed him to put it into play.


Takahashi fell quickly to the [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). When he tried to muster a defense with a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), Murakami revealed a [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) on the top of his library. When Takahashi found a [Venser, Shaper Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant), Murakami had [Swords To Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+To+Plowshares). When Takahashi found [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), Murakami had [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will).

After a few more turns and a few more attacks Takahashi succumbed to Murakami's onslaught and prepared for the second game.


**Kazuya Murakami 1 - 0 Yūta Takahashi**


Game 2 started just as Game 1 did; both players cast a first turn Sensei's Divining Top.


Murakami Attempted to cast a [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) on the following turn, but it was met with a [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) from Takahashi. When he attempted to cast [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor), Takahashi had a second [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)


Finally Murakami got a [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) to stick. Again, he went and found a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) from his library. A turn later Takahashi attempted to cast [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance); a counterwar ensued. [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) from Murakami was [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)ed by Takahashi, which was then [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)ed by Murakami.


Takahashi had the last word, though; a final [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) allowed Takahashi to assemble [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top).


Takahashi was not out of the woods just yet. He still had to deal with a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). Sitting on 10 life, Takahashi had two turns to deal with the living artifact and its 1/2 counterpart.


He found a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) which allowed him to cycle away a card and threatened to block the 4/4 on the following turn. Murakami tested the [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) waters with a [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) of his own. After looking through his top three cards, Takahashi decided on using Top's tap ability. In response, Murakami cast [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) on the Clique. Takahashi then used [Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas) to return his Clique to his hand, then revealed that he had drawn [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) to [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top).


With Murakami's threats gone, and [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)-Top in play, Takahashi recast his [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) and started eating away at Murakami's life total.


Murakami returned his [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) to his hand and recast it, but was still on the back foot. Takahashi quickly found a [Venser, Shaper Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant), which, paired with [Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas), made Murakami's attempts to attack with his 4/4 futile.


After Takahashi continually bounced the [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) turn after turn, his 3/1 Faerie went the distance and he evened the match up at one game a piece.


**Kazuya Murakami 1 - 1 Yūta Takahashi**


Murakami pondered his keep for the final game. When he played a Plains as his first land Takahashi was visibly excited. Without access to two blue mana on the second turn, Takahashi knew that Murakami would be unable to cast [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) for at least two turns.


Murakami still had a second turn play: [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). When Takahashi didn't counter, Murakami casually mentioned that he had nothing to search for--he already had [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) in his hand. Takahashi smiled, untapped, and cast [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). Murakami had a [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze), though, and Takahashi was content with getting his enchantment countered.


Takahashi had a second [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) and this time Murakami had a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) to counter it. Looking to close out the game as quickly as possible, Murakami followed up his [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) with a [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor).


Takahashi spent his entire turn looking for answer; Murakami was visibly excited when Takahashi shuffled with two [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s. During Murakami's upkeep, however, Takahashi activated his [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) and cast [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus). Murakami simply passed the turn back and Takahashi played a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor).

The following turn, Takahashi played [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). After that, it took little time for Takahashi to control the game with Jace. Once Takahashi found [Venser, Shaper Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant) it was just a matter of time until Murakami extended his hand and Yūta Takahashi became Grand Prix Kyōto 2015 Champion.
