Drive to Work: Episode 54
=========================


 







[**Episode 54**](http://media.wizards.com/podcasts/magic/drivetowork54flavortext.mp3): *Flavor Text* (10.7 MB)


My first podcast today is another [Matt Cavotta](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Matt%20Cavotta) carpool episode. He and I talk about the act of making flavor text, something we both have been in charge of at one point.
