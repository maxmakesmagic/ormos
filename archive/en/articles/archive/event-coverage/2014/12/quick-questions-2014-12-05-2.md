| "It's fine. Worse than Mana Leak but better than Divination." | "I don't care for it. I'll play it if I have the Lord of the Unreal, but that's about it." | "Phantasmal Dragon is certainly no Phantasmal Bear." |
| **Jonathan Smithers, 2-1 Draft 1** | **Nassim Ketita, 3-0 Draft 1** | **Jeremie Ross-Latour, 3-0 Draft 1** |
