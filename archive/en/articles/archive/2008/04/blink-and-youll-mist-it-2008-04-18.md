[Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) has performed all kinds of crazy acrobatics ever since it was printed in *Time Spiral*. Sometimes it seems like you run into a new [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) combo every week. Your key creature blinks away to dodge an [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate). Your [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) blinks out instead of paying echo, then blinks back in to destroy more lands. Your three-mana morph blinks out, then blinks in as the eight-mana [Akroma, Angel of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury). Your [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) blinks out and comes back again to draw more cards. And soon your [Murderous Redcap](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/shadowmoor/spoiler) can blink back to shed his -1/-1 counter and deal 2 damage all over again. [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) is definitely an update of the *Urza's Destiny* rare sorcery [Flicker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flicker) that inspired it.


For all that [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) does, there are definitely some things it fails to do. It can't save your creatures from [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) or [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm), since your creature always comes back immediately, just in time to die to the mass removal. You can't use [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) to tuck your creature away long enough to [Jokulhaups](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jokulhaups) the board and have your creature come back, since Blink just doesn't keep it away long enough. [Liberate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liberate), from *Invasion*, is a similar card that addresses this, keeping your creature out of the game for the whole turn while [Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath) or [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) resolves, then returning the creature to play at end of turn.


But in *Shadowmoor*, [Liberate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liberate) liberates itself from all those pesky restrictions, like white mana, being uncommon, and only targeting your own creatures. Click here to see it:



![Turn to Mist](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/latest/dl33_3bx8ag0.jpg)

Turn to Mist is a *Shadowmoor* common that does something similar to [Flicker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flicker), [Liberate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liberate), or [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink), but with key differences, giving up a four-mana flashback for a looser colored costs and a variety of new tricks that [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) can't perform, revolving around the ability of Turn to Mist to hit opponents' creatures. Hitting opponents' creatures means you can remove their auras, which turns out to be crucial in a world of multiple, powerful, common auras like [Shield of the Oversoul](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr326).


You can prevent all the damage that an enemy Dragon would deal to you by Turning it to Mist at the last moment, another place [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) can't help you. You can "flicker" out enemy blockers with Turn to Mist to get them out of the way for the turn while you attack, which is something else [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) can't do. Turn to Mist eliminates enemy token creatures forever, in a way that [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) can't.


Since Turn to Mist brings creatures back at end of turn instead of right away, it also saves your creatures from mass removal like [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) in way that [Liberate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liberate) and [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) can't.


What kind of wizard casts Turn to Mist? From the flavor text, it seems to be "Olka, Mistmeadow Witch," mocking her cinder opponent for his clumsy attacks. With that kind of bravado, maybe someday that witch can have its own *Magic* card. Oh what the heck, nobody likes waiting, how about we make it into its own card right now? Click here.



![Mistmeadow Witch](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/latest/dl33_rkkyo54.jpg)

Yikes. If Turn to Mist and [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) can do all that, just imagine what you can do with playing a free Turn to Mist or two every turn. All the tricks you do with [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink), you can do over and over again with Mistmeadow Witch. Let's look at the Blink tricks mentioned above. Using Mistmeadow Witch to turn your [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) to Mist every single turn? Pretty sick. [Flicker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flicker)ing out your [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) every turn, including the time you evoke it? Pretty sick. Letting your whole team dodge [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)s, and flipping over a morphed [Akroma, Angel of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury) at will? Yeah.


Mistmeadow Witch can also perform the whole family of tricks that Turn to Mist unlocks and that [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) can't accomplish. Don't want to get damaged by [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon)? Just flicker it out every time it attacks you. Ready to pop your opponents' token creatures? Send them all to Mistmeadow retirement. [Flicker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flicker) your opponents' blockers out of the way and attack right past them. Or flicker your opponents' creatures just in time to make their Auras fall off.


And your Mistmeadow Witch is awfully hard for your opponents to kill. If an opponent plays [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) to kill Mistmeadow Witch, just Turn the Witch to Mist in response, and it will come back at the end of the turn, safe and sound.


### From Whence the Witches?


*Shadowmoor* features a cycle of five Witches, one for each allied color pair. Each Witch is a hybrid creature that you can play for either color of mana in its color pair. But to maximize the card's power, you'll want to pay for its activated ability, which requires mana of both its colors.


Unlike most cycles in a set, *Shadowmoor*'s witches were created not during design, but during development. And they didn't enter the set until the development was already well underway. So what made the *Shadowmoor* development team want to add a new cycle? There were two main reasons: Rewarding two-color-decks, and rewarding the new tribal color pairs. (What can I say? We just like giving out rewards.)


### One-Color Decks vs. Two-Color Decks


One of my favorite parts about *Shadowmoor* is that it rewards monocolored decks in a big way. And that's true for both limited and constructed. In a normal set, a mono-red draft deck could choose from only one fifth of the cards in the draft. But in *Shadowmoor*, a mono-red draft deck can choose from all the mono-red cards, plus all the red-green hybrid cards, plus all the black-red hybrid cards. Since *Shadowmoor* is essentially half hybrid cards, this results in a hugely wider selection for mono-red draft decks than any other set. Mono-red Constructed decks can access the same wide selection.


Mono-red decks can also take advantage of the power built into cards with costs like B/R, B/R, B/R (such as [Ashenmoor Gouger](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/shadowmoor/spoiler)) or even R/G, R/G, R/G, R/G, R/G (such as [Deus of Calamity](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/shadowmoor/spoiler)) without batting a bloodshot eye, in both Limited and Constructed.


*Shadowmoor* also explicitly rewards mono-color decks with cards like [Jaws of Stone](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/shadowmoor/spoiler), [Beseech the Queen](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/dl31), and [Midnight Banshee](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr327). The *Shadowmoor* design team set a goal of making monocolored decks a consistently good option in *Shadowmoor* Limited in a way that no set has ever done before.


![Jaws of Stone, Beseech the Queen, and Midnight Banshee](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/latest/dl33_cardarts.jpg)


Development added Jaws of Stone to the set to support that goal, to supplement the mono-color rewards seeded in by the set's designers. As development proceeded, the *Shadowmoor* development team confirmed that the set was indeed succeeding in the goal of making monocolored decks Limited-playable.


In fact, the goal was being met... a little *too* well.


Monocolored draft decks had become so popular in our many internal *Shadowmoor* drafts that they were starting to squeeze out two-color decks! Playing with and against these mono-colored draft decks creates a new, unique experience for *Shadowmoor* Limited that previous blocks have never featured before.


But it's very important to developers to provide tons of draft diversity. That way, when people draft a format two dozen times, they have two dozen unique decks and two dozen unique experiences, always finding something new. That depth and texture helps a draft environment stay fresh over time, so that you come back for draft #25. Some of the best strategies R&D uses to ensure lots of draft diversity are to seed a format with lots of different archetypes, bridges linking different archetypes together, families of mini-combos, synergy clusters cross different colors, different deckbuilding paths, and different places to go.


With so many monocolored draft decks abounding in *Shadowmoor*, the *Shadowmoor* developers decided that we could and should increase draft diversity by giving some additional, powerful rewards to actual two-color decks with actual two-color land bases to help them compete with the powerful mono-colored decks. That way *Shadowmoor* would have ten major color combinations (white, blue, black, red, green, white-blue, blue-black, black-red, red-green, and green-white), in addition to the UNTAP combinations or -1/-1 counter synergies that can often pull you into even crazier combinations like blue-red or green-black-blue.


Of course, besides adding two-color rewards, another option was to remove some of the mono-color rewards. But all of the mono-color rewards in the set were playing great, and everybody was enjoying them. So instead of reducing rewards on one side of the monocolored vs. two-colored war, we decided just to give lots of rewards to both sides. It was like Christmas in July.


### Card Color Matters vs. Mana Color Matters


![Torrent of Souls](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/products/shadowmoor/images/1snbm16nzd_en.jpg)Since *Shadowmoor* is a "color matters" set, most of its rewards for two-color decks focus on the color of your cards, like the common Shield of the Oversoul. Since *Shadowmoor* is also a hybrid set, your "mono-green" decks whose only lands are forests can still play green-white hybrid creatures and get the most out of Shield of the Oversoul. Those combinations are a key part of the set.


But in giving more rewards to two-color decks, we needed to make sure that some of those rewards could be used only by two-colored decks with actual two-color land bases, and wouldn't be kidnapped by monocolored decks along the way.


So the question was: what to do to pull players into actual two-color manabases in a hybrid set? After all, hybrid fundamentally says, "You can play either color of mana, and you don't need to play both." One solution is instants and sorceries like [Torrent of Souls. The Torrent is a hybrid card, and you can play it with a different effect with either black mana or red mana. But to maximize it, you definitely hope to have both](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/shadowmoor/spoiler) [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s and [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s.


But we still needed more rewards for two-color manabases. After some discussion, the development team decided on adding five uncommon creatures with multicolored activation costs. As a member of the *Shadowmoor* design team and the *Shadowmoor* development team, I volunteered to put together a list of designs for what these uncommon creatures could be. And I'm happy to say that all five of the Witches in the final set are my designs, including Mistmeadow Witch.


### Rewarding New Tribal Color Pairs


The other reason we added the Witch cycle is to reward people for playing into *Shadowmoor*'s new tribal color pairs. Kithkin in *Lorwyn* / *Morningtide* are white with a touch of green, but since *Shadowmoor* is a mirror image to Lorwyn, Kithkin in *Shadowmoor* / *Eventide* are white with a touch of blue. Almost all of the blue Kithkin in *Shadowmoor* are white-blue hybrid creatures, which means you can play them in your existing mono-white or white-green Kithkin decks without any trouble.

But we also wanted to reward people for experimenting with a new path and a new color-pair for their tribal decks. So *Shadowmoor* has a sprinkling of cards that reward Kithkin decks for adding blue mana, reward Elf decks for adding white mana, reward Goblin decks for adding green mana, reward Merfolk for adding black mana, reward Elemental decks for adding black mana, or reward Giant decks for adding green mana.


All five Witches appear in the new color pairs for their tribes, and reward their casters for having mana of the each of the colors in the new color pair.


Combining Merfolk from *Tenth Edition*, *Time Spiral* block, *Lorwyn*, *Morningtide*, and *Shadowmoor*, you get to decide: Do you want to play mono-blue Merfolk, white-blue Merfolk, blue-black Merfolk, or even white-blue-black Merfolk? With *Shadowmoor*, the truly adventurous who want get seriously experimental can even abandon the base color entirely, and build something as bizarre as white-black Merfolk (with no blue), white-black Elves (with no green), or even the truly insane green-blue Kithkin with no white!


### Beyond Mistmeadow


Each of the five Witches is one or two mana, with activated abilities costing as little as two mana per activation. Mistmeadow Witch lends itself to combinations, control styles, or aggression, while the other four Witches are each very aggressively minded. Each of those four uses mana to decrease the enemy life total in some way, and each can quickly end the game in your favor.


*Magic* R&D will be on-site at the [*Shadowmoor* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) in [Seattle](http://ww2.wizards.com/Site/LeavingWizards.aspx?url=http://cascadegames.com/), running tomorrow and the next day. Some of us might even make a road trip down to the [Portland, OR Prerelease](http://ww2.wizards.com/Site/LeavingWizards.aspx?url=http://cascadegames.com/) to check out how they sling spells to the south. We hope to see you there, and be sure to tell us what you think of *Shadowmoor*!
