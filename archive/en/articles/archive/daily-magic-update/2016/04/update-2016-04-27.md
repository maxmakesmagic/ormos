The April 27, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 27, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the [*Magic* community](#community).


Today's Must
============


1. [Top 4 at Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13239&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=4-27-2016) | TCGPlayer | Seth Manfield

Look, I'm biased. The Esper Planeswalker deck Seth Manfield used to pilot to the Top 8 of Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* is easily my favorite deck to come out of the tournament. But let me convince you why this is today's must.


* It's the only Top 8 report published today (so far).
* You can read this and *also* read Neal Oliver's take on the deck ([an article on ChannelFireball](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/esper-planeswalkers/)) as well, since Oliver was on Manfield's team for the event and is one of the credited designers of the deck. It's like a two-for-one!
* Seth Manfield is the reigning World Champion.
* Seth Manfield is also now ranked...well, [scroll down](#top25) to find out.

That's four bullet points! I could have stopped at three! Four bullet points is so many! Clearly, that logic is unassailable and you must read this.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Making Sense of #paythepros](http://blog.mtgprice.com/2016/04/26/making-sense-of-paythepros/) | blog.mtgprice.com | Corbin Hosler

Corbin Hosler—a writer for this very site and also a coverage reporter—published a piece last night covering the expansion of *Magic* into the eSports realm and how that might have been the motivating factor in the changes to Organized Play [announced Sunday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi/2016-and-2017-premier-play-updates-announced-at-ptsoi-2016-04-24) (you know, the ones [we then walked back yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcement-concerning-changes-pro-club-2016-04-26)). Corbin is neither an employee of Wizards of the Coast nor a Platinum pro, so his stoic take on the matter is both measured and interesting.

What can I say that the headline doesn't already express? It's Commander VS! It returns! They play Commander! Again! After being away for some period of time!

Speaking of Commander, The Professor is here to help you build the trickiest of mana bases—the five-color Commander mana base. If you're new or somewhat new to Commander, the video also contains helpful links to primers to get you started.

1. [Changes to the Canadian Highlander Points List](https://canadianhighlander.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/changes-to-the-canadian-highlander-points-list/#more-1347) | canadianhighlander.wordpress.com

I wouldn't be making my triumphant return to the Daily *Magic* Update without a reference to Canadian Highlander, now would I? At least today there's actually news, as the crew who runs the format updated their points list (a version of the banned and restricted lists that doesn't ban anything, but does assign points to cards—you can only have so many points in your deck). The changes seem reasonable to me, even though they, naturally, throw off all my points in all of my [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) decks (which are, like, all of them).



Top 25
======


1. We have a new No. 1!

Writing the Top 25 can be a thankless job. Some weeks, very little changes. An uptick here, a player falling off there, a slight point degradation over there.


But not this week. Ooh boy do Pro Tours shake things up.


First of all, we have a new No. 1-ranked player in the world! Holding a lead that felt nigh insurmountable, Owen Turtenwald was passed by Seth Manfield after Turtenwald had a disappointing (by his lofty standards) showing at Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*. Manfield, the reigning World Champion, meanwhile, went all the way to the Top 8, picking up a ton of Pro Points and cementing himself as the new No. 1. Now he and Turtenwald are both light-years ahead of everyone else, as the difference between Turtenwald at No. 2 and Steve Rubin at No. 3 is about the same as the difference between Rubin and No. 23 Jon Finkel.


Speaking of Rubin and Finkel, Finkel had a chance to eliminate Rubin in the final round of the Swiss, but, after splitting the first two games of their match, took an intentional draw. The draw was all Rubin needed to make the Top 8, and once there he made the most of it, winning the whole thing. Rubin was off the rankings in 41st, so his 38-place rise was easily the most of the weekend—and rightfully so.


Other big gainers were No. 8 Joel Larsson, who finished just outside the Top 8, and No. 10 Brad Nelson, who finished just inside it. Additionally, Luis Scott-Vargas, Andrea Mengucci, Shota Yasooka, and Jon Finkel turned Top 8 performances into entrances into the Top 25 after living off it for a while.


So who dropped to make room for all of these risers? Last year's Player of the Year and former No. 1 Mike Sigrist fell 10 spots to No. 20, and Martin Dang is holding on precipitously to the 25th slot. Ben Stark, Kazuyuki Takamura, Jason Chung, Jacob Wilson, William Jensen, and Eric Froehlich were the unfortunate six who dropped off the chart to make room for the six intrepid players who entered.


So now we have a real race for the end of year No. 1 spot. Will it be Turtenwald? Will it be Manfield? Or will another challenger emerge before the end of the season?

What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Magic Mics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics)

Starts tonight at 11 p.m. ET on [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics). Evan Erwin, Reuben Bresler, and Erin Campbell discuss the issues of the week, which probably won't include the Organized Play changes.


Just kidding. [They almost definitely will.](https://twitter.com/misterorange/status/725079027971665921)



What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Short response - I'm humbled and grateful for the community's support of pro magic players and glad to see the changes rolled back.

There were, obviously, a lot of tweets I could have chosen to represent the ongoing conversation surrounding [#paythepros](https://twitter.com/hashtag/paythepros) and the [recent Organized Play changes](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcement-concerning-changes-pro-club-2016-04-26). Some, obviously, were unprintable on a family website. This was one of, if not the most liked tweets I saw, plus it seemed to be the sentiment most expressed by pro players from yesterday afternoon onward—thankfulness toward the community. [Ivan Floch was thankful](https://twitter.com/IvanFloch19/status/725078320979828736), [Lee Shi Tian was thankful](https://twitter.com/leearson/status/725117865834110976), and [Alexander Hayne was thankful](https://twitter.com/InsayneHayne/status/724947126686461952).


We do have a wonderful community, and whatever happened over the last few days or happens going forward, it's nice to remember that. The game is bigger than the cardboard—it's about all of us and the connection we have with one another.

Congratulations to Wedge of [The Mana Source](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheManaSource), who joined the 100,000-subscribers club last night. He's at around 100,074 as I write this, and as a positive member of the community, I can only see that continuing to go up.


If you haven't at least checked out some of his videos, this seems like a good excuse to give him a shot. His latest is a [primer on a Standard Blue-Red Sphinx's Tutelage deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arm_lYCWZa4), and before that was another in his [popular series of worst cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4OMeaE0uaI). Both are worth checking out.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Jeskai Nahiri Control](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi/24-28-point-standard-decklists-2016-04-24)

Though not my favorite deck to come out of [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi) (that would be Seth Manfield's planeswalker-heave Esper Control list, to the surprise of no one), this one has been the talk of internet forums and control mages the world over—Jeskai Nahiri Control.


As the standout deck to really utilize [Nahiri, the Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Harbinger), this deck by Rob Pisano is full of madness spells and other ways to utilize Nahiri's power, including a four-set of [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command), a card we didn't otherwise see much of at the Pro Tour.


And since Pisano went 8-2 with the deck (only his Limited record kept him out of the Top 8), this seems like it could be a strong deck in the format moving forward—which is why it was selected for the Pro Tour Gauntlet, which starts today on *Magic Online*!
