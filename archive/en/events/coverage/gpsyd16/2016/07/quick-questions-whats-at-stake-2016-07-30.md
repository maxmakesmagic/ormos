This next week in Australia is a huge one for *Magic* pros. It’s the end of the *Magic* year! That means it’s time to lock in Pro Player statuses, World *Magic* Cup captaincies, and, of course, the World Championship slots.


Some of the races seem foregone conclusions—Top-ranked Seth Manfield seems untouchable for Player of Year on his based status alone—but there’s plenty of new goals for many combatants to try to reach. I ran into a few pros to find out What’s at Stake? What are their #EndofSeasonGoals here at Grand Prix Sydney?


 


**Christian Calcano**


The consummate American mainstay is shooting for Platinum Pro Player status this year. He’s closer than he’s ever been.

**Martin Dang**


The Pro Tour–winning Dane has his own fish to fry. Even if the World *Magic* Cup captaincy is seemingly out of reach.

**Scott Lipp**


Team East West Bowl’s Scott “Spanky” Lipp is on the cusp of Gold—for the first time. He also waxed a bit about his marquee deck in Modern he calls “Spaghetti and Meatballs.”

**Shaheen Soorani**


Soorani has had a banner year, getting a much-needed Top 8, and locking up Silver for the first time (by a *match*). Now—why not?—he’s shooting for Gold.

**(10) Sam Black**


Tenth-ranked Sam Black has already hit a lot of the markers, but World Champs is still open. And as Sam does, he does all the things.
