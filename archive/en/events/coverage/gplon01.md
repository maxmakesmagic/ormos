2001 GRAND PRIX LONDON COVERAGE
===============================

|  | 2001 Grand Prix London Coverage |  |

Pro Tour player of the year Kai Budde has won his fourth Grand Prix event, setting yet another record. He beat Gabriel Nassif in three close games. Kai was playing a version of the Domain deck. This deck archetype was recently pronounced dead and buried at Grand Prix Denver. Reports of Domain's demise have been greatly exaggerated, with Pierre Malherbaud also making Top 8 with yet another version of the deck (one heavily featuring land destruction). It's definitely a force to be reckoned with for the rest of the season.


Kai's victory must have many other professional players wondering whether they have a chance of taking away Kai's Player of the Year title this season.
