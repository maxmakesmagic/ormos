As 2009 winds down, we look back at what we've achieved and what we hope to achieve in the coming year. And then we show pictures of the *Worldwake* Fat Pack!

Well, hello there, *Worldwake* Fat Pack! What treasures do you contain?

Reading from left to right, there's a handsome storage box, the *Worldwake* Player's Guide (featuring a [familiar Planeswalker](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/ProductArticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/worldwake/planeswalkerchase) on the cover), forty *Zendikar* basic lands (the kind without the text box), the wrapper, a sample chapter from Robert B. Wintermute's *In the Teeth of Akoum*, and eight *Worldwake* booster packs.


We'll give you a closer look at those boosters tomorrow, but right now we're more interested in the art by Eric Deschamps, featuring Jace dealing with some unusual Zendikar weather.

*(Note: The thing we originally identified as a second storage box is actually the wrapper, which can be unfolded to show the great art. We apologize for the error.)*
