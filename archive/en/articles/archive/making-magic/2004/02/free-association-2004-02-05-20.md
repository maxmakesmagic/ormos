 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






One of the ongoing disputes in R&D is which *Star Wars* film: *A New Hope* (the original film) or *The Empire Strikes Back*? I'm in the *New Hope* camp as I believe that *Empire* is only as good a film as it is because it builds on all the work done by *New Hope*. My contention is that *Empire* seen in a vacuum (that is without seeing any other *Star Wars* films) does not stand up as well as *New Hope*. 


That said, I think *Empire* is a great film and #2 in the *Star Wars* collection by a healthy margin. Other [R&D](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-52) members disagree. They believe that *Empire* simply as a movie-going experience is better than *New Hope*. They say that the two films need to be judged side by side. 


This fight has been going on for as long as I've worked at [Wizards](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-68) and I have no belief that it will ever be resolved. 


What do you all believe? I'd be happy to hear your [feedback](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-25).
