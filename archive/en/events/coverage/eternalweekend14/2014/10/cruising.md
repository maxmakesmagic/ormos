[Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) is making some big waves in Legacy here at The Legacy Championship. The most popular home for the powerhouse card draw spell seems to be alongside a lot of burn spells and aggressive creatures. This means that we're seeing matches end quickly and decisively as players draw into pairs of burn spells to end games out of nowhere.




**Why is [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) so strong in Legacy?**




 According to (7) Ari Lax, [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) gives every deck access to a playable mass card draw effect. Before, cards like [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s existed, but we had to build our deck in a very specific way to get that advantage. [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) is accessible to most Blue Legacy strategies and it doesn't force us to warp our deck.




**What can we do to combat [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise)?**




 World Champion, (20) Shahar Shenhar contends that [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker) is the best card against the Blue/Red [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) strategies. We've also seen a lot of players go big with [Veteran Explorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Explorer). The [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) decks are generally cutting some amount of countermagic to make room for the new draw spell and bigger more powerful cards are resolving a lot more often.




**What should we avoid playing in a world of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise)?** 




 Gerard Fabiano, multiple time Grand Prix Champion, says that cards like [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) become much worse in a format with [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). In general, it's very difficult to play a fair deck without [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) when our opponent has access to it.




 It's clear that [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) will be a staple in Legacy going forward. Be prepared to play against the newest [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) at your next Legacy event, even if you're planning on playing with it yourself.
