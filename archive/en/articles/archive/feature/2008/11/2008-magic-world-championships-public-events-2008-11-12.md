**\* Travel:**

The players eligible to receive a travel award will receive instructions from Wizards of the Coast on whom they must contact and the deadline by which they must arrange their travel awards. Wizards of the Coast will not refund travel made outside this service. Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to award a cash equivalent award in lieu of any travel award in its sole discretion.

All travel itineraries must be from the international airport nearest the player's home and to the host city of the applicable Pro Tour or World Championship or event, and must include all the dates of that event. No award will be substituted if member is unable to participate. All other expenses are the responsibility of the member and may include, without limitation, accommodations, ground transportation, taxes, itinerary change fees, passport and visa fees.

This award must be redeemed through member's arrangement of travel itinerary no later than (30) days before departure. Failure to complete travel arrangements as directed by Wizards of the Coast prior to this deadline will result in forfeiture of the award. Every member receiving a travel award must provide to Wizards of the Coast an executed liability release, the appropriate US taxation form (W9 or W8) (or have one on file), current contact information (<http://webapp.wizards.com/dcimember/>), proof of ID and passport (when required by international destination). In all cases, all such documentation must be provided to Wizards of the Coast, or previously on file, at least thirty (30) days before departure. Failure to timely provide such documentation will result in forfeiture of the award.

As with other awards, the players must attend, compete (though not necessarily on the same team), and be listed as finishing in the applicable tournament for which he or she received the travel award. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in forfeiture of the award.

All taxes are the responsibility of the members, and members acknowledge Wizards' recommendation that they consult a tax advisor in their jurisdictions for questions regarding their tax liabilities.

Alcoholic beverages, gratuities, and transportation to and from the cruise ship itself in Galveston, Texas and all other fees, costs, and expenses not specified herein are the winner's sole responsibility. All taxes are the sole responsibility of the winner. A representative of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. will contact the winner regarding this prize package. This prize is non-negotiable, non-transferable, and not redeemable for an alternate award except in Wizards' sole discretion. Cruise must be taken on the dates designated by Wizards, or prize will be forfeited and will not be re-awarded. The winner will be required to sign and return prior to travel (i) a signed Consent and Release Agreement, (ii) the appropriate IRS tax form, (iii) proof of identification, and (iv) and other documentation designated by Wizards; failure to do so will result in disqualification. Minors (i.e., those under 18 years of age) who win the *Games in the Gulf* Championship are not eligible to be awarded the cruise ship award. Instead, minors will be awarded a "Cash Equivalent Award" equal to the cost of the *Games in the Gulf* event, as determined by Wizards in its sole discretion.
