When the art for a new set comes in, it sometimes gets shuffled around. That's especially possible when you're dealing with elementals, which (on Lorwyn, at least) are strange hybrids of surreal and animal elements that represents the "living magic" of an idea, thought, or dream. Here's the original art description for [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark):



> *This creature is an elemental, which on Lorwyn means it's a strange hybrid of surreal and animal elements that represents the "living magic" of an idea, thought, or dream. This elemental consists of the body of a large lamb-like creature with three sets of huge butterfly wings (three wings on each side of the body) and a featureless face. It must have some elements of intangibility, surreality, like it might be a hallucination.*


That got executed very well by Terese Nielsen:

Now here's the original description for [Shinewend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinewend):



> *This elemental consists of two pairs of long doves' wings, one right side up, the other upside down, linked together by something akin to a large, compound bird's nest made of living vine. There are eggs in this nest (woven in?, sitting in compartments?) each of which shine*


Again, Jim Murray's art looks awesome:

The only problem is if you put the two cards next to each other. Here's what they would look like with their original art assignments:

See the problem? [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) is a 4/3, but it looks much smaller than [Shinewend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinewend), which is supposed to be 1/1 (and arguably a 0/0!). And these cards are right next to each other alphabetically (collector numbers 22 and 23) so they'd be seen in conjunction all the time. Luckily, the cards were abstract enough that they could be trade art, and everything would work out okay!
