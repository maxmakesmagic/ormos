An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice).

This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.

The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.

The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**New Keyword: Miracle**

The archangel Avacyn returned in the humans' darkest hour, proving that a well-timed miracle can turn the tide of battle. Miracle is a new ability found on instants and sorceries that lets you cast them for an incredibly low cost if you draw them at the right time. Cards with miracle feature a modified frame to instantly let you know you've drawn one.

>  Sorcery   
>  Until end of turn, target creature gets +6/+6 and gains trample, and all creatures able to block it this turn do so.   
>  Miracle ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) (You may cast this card for its miracle cost when you draw it if it's the first card you drew this turn.) 

The official rules for miracle are as follows:


> 
> 702.91. Miracle
> 
> 
> 702.91a Miracle is a static ability linked to a triggered ability (see rule 603.10). "Miracle [cost]" means "You may reveal this card from your hand as you draw it if it's the first card you've drawn this turn. When you reveal this card this way, you may cast it by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost."
> 
> 
> 702.91b If a player chooses to reveal a card using its miracle ability, he or she plays with that card revealed until that card leaves his or her hand, that ability resolves, or that ability otherwise leaves the stack.
> 
> 
> 

* You still draw the card, whether you use the miracle ability or not. Any ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, for example, will trigger. If you don't cast the card using its miracle ability, it will remain in your hand.
* You can reveal and cast a card with miracle on any turn, not just your own, if it's the first card you've drawn that turn.
* You don't have to reveal a drawn card with miracle if you don't wish to cast it at that time.
* You can cast a card for its miracle cost only as the miracle triggered ability resolves. If you don't want to cast it at that time (or you can't cast it, perhaps because there are no legal targets available), you won't be able to cast it later for the miracle cost.
* You cast the card with miracle during the resolution of the triggered ability. Ignore any timing restrictions based on the card's type.
* It's important to reveal a card with miracle before it is mixed with the other cards in your hand.
* Multiple card draws are always treated as a sequence of individual card draws. For example, if you haven't drawn any cards yet during a turn and cast a spell that instructs you to draw three cards, you'll draw them one at a time. Only the first card drawn this way may be revealed and cast using its miracle ability.
* If the card with miracle leaves your hand before the triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to cast it using its miracle ability.
* You draw your opening hand before any turn begins. Cards you draw for your opening hand can't be cast using miracle.

**New Keyword: Soulbond**

Soulbond is a new ability that allows creatures to work together on the battlefield, sharing abilities and other bonuses.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/avr/btyixpk1h0_en.jpg)Wingcrafter   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
>  Creature -- Human Wizard   
>  1/1   
>  Soulbond (You may pair this creature with another unpaired creature when either enters the battlefield. They remain paired for as long as you control both of them.)   
>  As long as Wingcrafter is paired with another creature, both creatures have flying. 

The official rules for soulbond are as follows:


> 
> 702.92. Soulbond
> 
> 
> 702.92a. Soulbond is a keyword that represents two triggered abilities. "Soulbond" means "When this creature enters the battlefield, if you control both this creature and another creature and both are unpaired, you may pair this creature with another unpaired creature you control for as long as both remain creatures on the battlefield under your control" and "Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, if you control both that creature and this one and both are unpaired, you may pair that creature with this creature for as long as both remain creatures on the battlefield under your control."
> 
> 
> 702.92b A creature becomes "paired" with another as the result of a soulbond ability. Abilities may refer to a paired creature, the creature another creature is paired with, or whether a creature is paired. An "unpaired" creature is one that is not paired.
> 
> 
> 702.92c When the soulbond ability resolves, if either object that would be paired is no longer a creature, no longer on the battlefield, or no longer under the control of the player who controls the soulbond ability, neither object becomes paired.
> 
> 
> 702.92d A creature can be paired with only one other creature.
> 
> 
> 702.92e A paired creature becomes unpaired if any of the following occur: another player gains control of it or the creature it's paired with; it or the creature it's paired with stops being a creature; or it or the creature it's paired with leaves the battlefield.
> 
> 
> 

* Two paired creatures are still individual creatures in every way: they attack and block individually, they are targeted and affected by spells or abilities individually, and they change zones individually. If two paired creatures are attacking, blocking one of them has no effect on the other, for example.
* Neither soulbond ability targets any creature.
* You must control another unpaired creature at the moment a creature with soulbond enters the battlefield or the soulbond ability won't trigger at all. However, the creature that pairs with the creature with soulbond isn't chosen until the soulbond ability resolves.
* If the pair is broken, the bonuses and abilities granted to the creatures immediately disappear. If the bonus included an increase to toughness, this may cause a creature to have damaged marked on it equal to or greater than its toughness. If that happens, the creature is destroyed.
* If becoming unpaired causes a creature to no longer have an activated ability, instances of that ability that have already been activated and are on the stack are unaffected.
* Certain keywords granted to paired creatures are only relevant at a specific time, usually during combat, so becoming unpaired and no longer having that ability may have no effect on the current turn. For example, if a creature with reach blocks a flying creature and then loses reach, the creature with flying will still be blocked.
* A creature with soulbond may grant an ability to itself and the creature it's paired with that includes the text "this creature." In such abilities, "this creature" refers only to the creature that has that ability, not the creature it's paired with.
* If a creature with soulbond is paired with another creature with soulbond, each of them will receive both bonuses.
* If you control multiple unpaired creatures with soulbond and another creature enters the battlefield, each soulbond ability will trigger. Soulbond abilities that try to resolve after you pair the creature will have no effect.
* If a paired creature with soulbond loses soulbond, it and the creature it's paired with remain paired.

**Theme: "Flickering"**

Several cards in the *Avacyn Restored* set exile a permanent and then return that permanent to the battlefield under your control.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/avr/624ndn0o20_en.jpg)Conjurer's Closet   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)  
>  Artifact   
>  At the beginning of your end step, you may exile target creature you control, then return that card to the battlefield under your control. 

* A permanent that returns to the battlefield after being exiled does so as an entirely new object. It will have no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
* Unless an effect says otherwise, permanents enter the battlefield untapped, creatures can't attack or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) until they've been continuously under your control since the start of your most recent turn, and double-faced cards enter the battlefield with their front face up.
* Any Auras attached to a permanent that leaves the battlefield will be put into their owner's graveyard the next time state-based actions are checked. Any Equipment attached to a permanent that leaves the battlefield become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on a permanent that leaves the battlefield cease to exist.
* If a token creature is exiled, it will cease to exist. It won't return to the battlefield.
* If a paired creature is exiled, the pair will break. However, the creature entering the battlefield again will cause its soulbond ability (or the soulbond ability of the creature it was paired with, as appropriate) to trigger again. This may cause the creature to pair with the creature it was previously paired with or another creature.
* If a creature you've gained control of temporarily (perhaps due to the ability of Zealous Conscripts) is exiled and returns to the battlefield under your control, you will control that creature indefinitely.

>  Instant   
>  Aggravate deals 1 damage to each creature target player controls. Each creature dealt damage this way attacks this turn if able.

* Aggravate targets only the player. Creatures with hexproof that player controls will be dealt damage by Aggravate if it resolves.
* The controller of a creature dealt damage by Aggravate still decides which player or planeswalker the creature attacks.
* If, during a player's declare attackers step, a creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

* You can cast a nonland card with flash any time you could cast an instant.
* The last ability applies to nonland cards in any zone, provided something is allowing you to cast them. For example, you could cast a sorcery with flashback as though it had flash.

>  Sorcery   
>  Draw three cards, then put a card from your hand on the bottom of your library.

* If you cast Amass the Components with fewer than three cards in your library, you'll draw the remaining cards in your library, put a card from your hand on the bottom of your library, then lose the game for drawing a card from a library with no cards in it the next time state-based actions are performed.

>  3/3   
>  Flying   
>  Other nonblack creatures you control get +1/+1.   
>  Players can't pay life or sacrifice creatures to cast spells or activate abilities.

* If a spell or activated ability has a cost that requires a player to pay life (as Griselbrand's activated ability does) or sacrifice a creature (as [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) does), that spell or ability can't be cast or activated.
* Other things may still cause players to pay life or sacrifice creatures, such as a resolving spell or ability.
* Angel of Jubilation's last ability doesn't look for specific words on other cards. Rather, it stops players from taking specific actions. For example, you couldn't activate an ability with an activation of cost of "Sacrifice an artifact:" by sacrificing an artifact creature (although you could sacrifice a noncreature artifact).

>  Artifact   
>  Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you may have Angel's Tomb become a 3/3 white Angel artifact creature with flying until end of turn.

* If Angel's Tomb is already a creature when a creature enters the battlefield, its ability will override any effects that set its power and toughness to specific values, but other changes to its power and toughness will still apply.

>  Sorcery   
>  Target opponent reveals his or her hand. You choose a card from it with converted mana cost 4 or greater and exile that card.

* Arcane Melee can't reduce the colored mana requirement of an instant or sorcery spell.
* If there are additional costs to cast a spell, such as a kicker cost or a cost imposed by another effect (such as [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben)'s ability), apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
* Arcane Melee can reduce alternative costs such as miracle costs.
* The cost to cast an instant or sorcery spell with one generic mana in its mana cost will be reduced by ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif).

* Dark Impostor gains only activated abilities. It doesn't gain triggered abilities or static abilities. Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keywords are activated abilities; they have colons in their reminder text.
* If an activated ability of a card in exile references the card it's printed on by name, treat Dark Impostor's version of that ability as though it referenced Dark Impostor by name instead. For example, if Marrow Bats (which says "Pay 4 life: [Regenerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regenerate) Marrow Bats") is exiled with Dark Impostor, Dark Impostor has the ability "Pay 4 life: [Regenerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regenerate) Dark Impostor."
* Dark Impostor can target and exile a permanent that's only a creature temporarily, like an animated land. However, because that card isn't a creature card, Dark Impostor won't have any of that card's activated abilities.
* If you control more than one Dark Impostor, each will have only the activated abilities of creature cards exiled with that specific Dark Impostor.

* First you choose the permanents and/or cards from your hand that will be exiled. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Then all the chosen permanents and cards are exiled simultaneously. Players who choose after you will know what permanents you'll be exiling when they choose. They'll know how many cards you'll be exiling from your hand, but they won't see those cards.
* If there are more counters on Descent into Madness than the total number of permanents you control plus the number of cards in your hand, you'll exile all permanents you control (including Descent into Madness) and all cards from your hand.
* If Descent into Madness isn't on the battlefield when its ability resolves, use the number of counters on it when it left the battlefield to determine how many permanents and/or cards from hands to exile.

>  Instant   
>  Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to you and/or permanents you control this turn. If damage is prevented this way, Divine Deflection deals that much damage to target creature or player.

* Divine Deflection's only target is the creature or player it may deal damage to. You choose that target as you cast Divine Deflection, not at the time it prevents damage.
* If the targeted creature or player is an illegal target by the time Divine Deflection resolves, the entire spell is countered. No damage will be prevented.
* Divine Deflection can prevent damage that would be dealt to you, one or more creatures you control, and/or one or more planeswalkers you control.
* Divine Deflection can prevent damage from multiple sources dealing damage simultaneously (such as during combat). If the chosen value for X won't prevent all the damage, you choose which sources to prevent damage from.
* If damage is dealt to multiple permanents you control, or is dealt to you and at least one permanent you control, you choose which of that damage to prevent if the chosen value for X won't prevent all the damage. For example, if 3 damage would be dealt to you and to each of two creatures you control, and Divine Deflection will prevent the next 3 damage, you might choose to prevent the next 2 damage it would deal to you and the next 1 damage it would deal to one of the creatures, among other choices. You don't decide until the point at which the damage would be dealt.
* Divine Deflection's effect is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, Divine Deflection (not the original source) deals damage to the targeted creature or player as part of that prevention effect. Divine Deflection is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don't affect this damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was. Since you control the source of the new damage, if you targeted an opponent with Divine Deflection, you may have Divine Deflection deal its damage to a planeswalker that opponent controls.
* If Divine Deflection prevents damage, excess damage (if any) dealt by that source is dealt at the same time. Immediately afterward, as part of that same prevention effect, Divine Deflection deals its damage. This happens before state-based actions are checked, and before the spell or ability that caused damage to be dealt resumes its resolution.
* Whether the targeted creature or player is still a legal target is not checked after Divine Deflection resolves. For example, if a creature targeted by Divine Deflection gains shroud after Divine Deflection resolves, Divine Deflection can still deal damage to that creature.
* If Divine Deflection can't deal damage to the targeted creature or player (because the creature has gained protection from white, is no longer on the battlefield, or is no longer a creature, or the player is no longer in the game, for example), it will still prevent damage. It just won't deal any damage itself.

* Each time a creature dies, check whether Dread Slaver had dealt any damage to it at any time during that turn. If so, Dread Slaver's ability will trigger. It doesn't matter who controlled the creature or whose graveyard it was put into.
* If Dread Slaver and a creature it was blocking or blocked by both die in combat, Dread Slaver's ability will trigger.
* Dread Slaver will return if it somehow dealt damage to itself and then dies.
* The card will return to the battlefield under your control only if it's still in the graveyard when the ability resolves. If it's not (perhaps because an ability like undying has already returned it to the battlefield), nothing happens.

You may choose new targets for the copy."

* The ability granted by Dual Casting can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one --" or the like), the copy will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
* If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) does), the copy has the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) and then copy it with the ability granted by Dual Casting, the copy of [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) will also deal 3 damage to its target.

* Gisela doubles damage dealt to opponents and permanents your opponents control from any source, including sources controlled by those opponents.
* If multiple replacement effects would modify how damage would be dealt, the player being dealt damage (or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage) chooses the order in which to apply those effects.
* If damage dealt by a source you control is being divided among multiple permanents an opponent controls or among an opponent and one or more permanents he or she controls simultaneously, divide the original amount and double the results. For example, if you attack with a 5/5 creature with trample and your opponent blocks with a 2/2 creature, you can assign 2 damage to the blocker and 3 damage to the defending player. These amounts are then doubled to 4 and 6 damage, respectively. You can't double the damage to 10 first and then assign 2 to the creature and 8 to the player.

>  Enchant creature   
>  When Infinite Reflection enters the battlefield attached to a creature, each other nontoken creature you control becomes a copy of that creature.   
>  Nontoken creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of enchanted creature.

* Infinite Reflection can enchant a creature controlled by another player.
* If Infinite Reflection enters the battlefield attached to a creature and then becomes attached to a different creature before its enters-the-battlefield trigger resolves, each other nontoken creature you control will become a copy of the first creature.
* If Infinite Reflection leaves the battlefield or becomes attached to a different creature, none of the copy effects end. Your creatures will still be copies of whatever creature each was a copy of.
* If Infinite Reflection enters the battlefield attached to a token creature, the nontoken creatures that become copies of that creature are not themselves tokens.
* Creatures you control don't copy whether the enchanted creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it, whether it has any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* Because creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of the enchanted creature, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities printed on such creatures won't trigger. However, if the enchanted creature has any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities, those will trigger.
* Replacement effects that modify how a permanent enters the battlefield are now applied in the following order: control-changing effects (such as [Gather Specimens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Specimens)), then copy effects (such as the abilities of Infinite Reflection and [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone)), then all other effects. This is a recent rules change introduced with the release of the \_Dark Ascension\_ set.
* If a creature such as [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) is entering the battlefield under your control, there will be two copy effects to apply: the creature's own and Infinite Reflection's. No matter what order these effects are applied, the creature will be a copy of the enchanted creature when it enters the battlefield.
* Other enters-the-battlefield replacement abilities printed on the creature entering the battlefield won't be applied because the creature will already be a copy of the enchanted creature at that point (and therefore it won't have those abilities). For example, if the enchanted creature is [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), a creature that normally enters the battlefield tapped will enter the battlefield as an untapped copy of [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), and a creature that would normally enter the battlefield with counters on it will enter the battlefield as a copy of [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) with no counters.
* External abilities may still affect how a creature enters the battlefield. For example, if your opponent controls [Urabrask the Hidden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urabrask+the+Hidden), which reads, in part, "Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped," a creature entering the battlefield under your control will be a tapped copy of the enchanted creature.
* If you control more than one Infinite Reflection, you can apply those copy effects in any order. Creatures you control will enter the battlefield as a copy of the one whose copy effect you apply last.

* You can't pay more life than you have.
* If you can't sacrifice a creature (perhaps because of Sigarda, Host of Herons), you can choose not to pay life and nothing will happen.

>  Spells and abilities your opponents control can't cause you to sacrifice permanents.

* As a spell or ability an opponent controls resolves, if it would force you to sacrifice a permanent, you just don't. That part of the effect does nothing. If that spell or ability gives you the option to sacrifice a permanent (as Brain Gorger's ability does), you can't take that option.
* If a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to perform an action unless you sacrifice a permanent (as Ogre Marauder does), you can't choose to sacrifice a permanent. You must perform the action. On the other hand, if a spell or ability an opponent controls instructs you to sacrifice a permanent unless you perform an action (as Killing Wave does), you can choose whether or not to perform the action. If you don't perform the action, nothing happens, since you can't sacrifice any permanents.
* You may still sacrifice permanents to pay the costs of spells you cast and abilities you activate, or because a resolving spell or ability you control instructs or allows you to do so.
* You may sacrifice a permanent to pay the activation cost of an ability, even if that ability comes from a permanent an opponent controls (such as Excavation).
* You may sacrifice a permanent as a special action, even if the effect that allows you to do so comes from an opponent's permanent (such as Damping Engine or Volrath's Curse). No one controls special actions.
* This ability affects only sacrifices. It won't stop a creature from being put into the graveyard due to lethal damage or having 0 toughness, and it won't stop a permanent from being put into the graveyard due to the "legend rule" or the "planeswalker uniqueness rule." None of these are sacrifices; they're the result of game rules.
