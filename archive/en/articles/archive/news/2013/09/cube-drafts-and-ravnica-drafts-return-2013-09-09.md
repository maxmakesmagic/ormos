Cube Drafts and Ravnica Drafts Return!
======================================



 Posted in **News**
 on December 8, 2013 










The **Magic Online** Cube returns Wednesday, September 25, following the downtime.


This Cube changes things up a bit. Besides introducing new cards as we usually do-- this time we've swapped in eight new cards--we've also boosted the prizes for both Cube formats and changed the entry options. Read on for the full details!


If you're unfamiliar with a **Magic Online** Cube, it is a selection of hundreds of cards that can span the entire history of **Magic**. These are divided into fifteen-card "booster packs" for drafting, but there are no multiples of cards-each card is unique in the Cube. Playing a **Magic Online** Cube takes you on a tour of **Magic**'s past.

Increased Prizes, New Entry Requirements and Entry Options
We're constantly working on ways to improve the **Magic Online** experience. The Cube events have always been very popular, and we want events like the Cube to be exciting for the broadest audience possible. We also want the play experience to be more rewarding, and for successful players to be able to enter more **Magic Online** events.


To accomplish this, we've [boosted the prizes for this Cube](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/09092013#cubedetails). In single-elimination drafts 1st- and 2nd-place finishers will each receive boosters from the original *Ravnica* block, as well as Phantom Points, so they'll be able to jump right into a *Ravnica* draft. For Cube Swiss drafts, we significantly increased Phantom Points for both 2 and 3 Match Wins, and we fully doubled the points players receive for 0 and 1 Match Wins.


While for this Cube there is a slight increase to the Cube entry, the new payout structure gives all players more bang for their buck. In addition to using exclusively Event Tickets, we've adjusted the entry options to allow players to enter using exclusively Phantom Points.


We're always looking for new ways to give all our players the best possible **Magic Online** experience. Expect even more exciting changes in the months to come!
