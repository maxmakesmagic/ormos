Have your opponent seeing stars with the newest set of drops from *Secret Lair: Theros Stargazing*, exclusively available during the *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship February 14–16.


The light of Nyx shines bright in the Theros night sky. Each constellation tells a story, and no story is as important as that of the gods. This drop is a must-have for any true believer—your favorite legendary creatures from the original *Theros* at their celestial best.


Five drops. Three days only. All on [secretlair.wizards.com](https://secretlair.wizards.com/us). Don't get left out!

Shipping
========


Similar to December's *Secret Lair* drops, we want to make sure you can get this drop if you want it. Purchase during the World Championship, and you're guaranteed to be gazing at the Gods.


We've stocked a limited quantity right away, so we have some ready to head to their admirers ASAP. The earlier you order, the more likely you'll be a part of the stocked wave (and therefore get it earlier)! If you're in the wave that needs to be printed (i.e. any orders that come in after that initial stock is spoken for) you can expect to get yours in a handful of weeks. But don't fear, they'll arrive at your door.


We can ship to the following regions:


* Austria
* Australia
* Argentina\*
* Belgium
* Canada\*
* China\*
* Croatia
* Cyprus
* Czech Republic
* Denmark
* Finland
* France
* Germany
* Greece
* Hong Kong\*
* Hungary
* Ireland
* Italy
* Japan\*
* Luxembourg
* Macao\*
* Malta
* Mexico\*
* Netherlands
* New Zealand\*
* Norway\*
* Poland
* Portugal
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* South Korea\*
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland\*
* Taiwan\*
* United Kingdom
* United States
* Vietnam\*

\*Customers in these regions may have to pay customs/duty fees upon arrival.
