As we near [GP Vienna](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/grandprix/vienna14) (March 21-23), we would like to inform players of some additional on-site requirements implemented by Vienna authorities.


As is standard practice in this region for large public events:


* Anyone attending under the age of 18 is required to have a written consent from a parent or legal guardian in order to participate.
* Anyone under the age of 14 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian and is also required to have a written consent from a parent or legal guardian signed in person at the registration in order to participate.

Any player under the age of 18 who does not present the proper documentation or meet the requirements above will not be allowed entry into events.


For more information on GP Vienna, please visit the Tournament organizer's website [here](http://www.gordianknotgames.co.uk/magicgrandprix.html). With any specific questions, you can contact the event organizer at [info@gordianknotgames.co.uk](mailto:info@gordianknotgames.co.uk).
