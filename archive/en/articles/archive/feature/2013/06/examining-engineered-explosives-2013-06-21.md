There were a number of new art pieces on cards in *Modern Masters*, among them was a rare from *Fifth Dawn* called [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives).


Even though the new card is in *Modern Masters*, the art remained set on the plane of *Mirrodin*. If you look carefully in the art you can see the hexagonal metalic plates which make up the ground on *Mirrodin*.

Additionally, while it is obvious you are observing some sort of magical explosion, it may be less obvious that the things being thrown by the explosion are [Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bmyr%5D), who are now mid-flight as they flung by the explosive force.
