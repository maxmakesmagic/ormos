This week we're on to the final tribe of *Commander (2017 Edition)*, and the most likely to stare at you while going to the bathroom right on your clean clothes—Cats. We've already previewed all the cards from C17, so the gloves are off.


Also, since people requested it, our good friend and community member Cary Thomas ([@Vronos](https://twitter.com/Vronos)) took it upon themself to transcribe the episode, which [you can read here](https://vronos.com/magic-story-podcast-transcripts/magic-story-podcast-cats/). Of course, then you're missing out on the dulcet tones of our voices, but, hey, you do you.
