We've got a great column for you this week, simply because it contains the first half of the long-awaited results of the Birthday Contest! Yes, we're going to ignore all the neat recent developments in **Magic** for the time being (***Magic** 2010*, the rules changes, and whatnot) and focus on a crazy Johnny contest that I [kicked off](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/41) about a month ago.

For newcomers to this contest or for those who like refreshments, the Birthday Contest was a typically restrictive but casual contest in which each contestant had to build a 60-card deck containing, at minimum, one copy of each **Magic** card that fell on their respective birthday in the [Card of the Day archive](/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?page=0amp;tag=cardofthedayamp;description=Card%20of%20the%20Day).
