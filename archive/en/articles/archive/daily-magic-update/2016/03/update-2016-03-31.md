The March 31, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 31, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel). I'd say we hardly knew ye, but [we knew ye really well. Like, really well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4col6i/for_the_first_time_since_its_printing_10_years/)


Today's Must
============


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* Set Review: Commons and Uncommons](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-330-shadows-over-innistrad-set-review-commons-and-uncommons/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Marshall and Luis review Every. Single. Common. And. Uncommon. in this podcast that clocks in at *five hours and 39 minutes*. This is a massive undertaking, especially before the Prerelease this weekend, but it will, in all likelihood, make you the most knowledgeable person at your Prerelease. Heck, with this much content you might know more about *Shadows over Innistrad* than R&D. This thing will practically suck up your entire work day, filling it with the soothing tones of Marshall and the jokes (as well as the "jokes") of LSV. Worth the effort if you're into exhaustive set reviews.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [13 *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited Build-Arounds](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/13-shadows-over-innistrad-limited-build-arounds/) | ChannelFireball | Neal Oliver

What cards should you be looking to build around at your Prerelease this weekend? Neal Oliver has the, appropriately, thirteen best options to give your deck focus.


1. [MTG—The Top 5 Cards from *Shadows over Innistrad* BEST for Pauper for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8taftd1bzX4) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

Pauper keeps getting some love as The Professor runs through his top cards from *Shadows over Innistrad*. He's on point with this contextualized review, even if none of these cards go in my pet Temur Tron deck. But for fans of Pauper, this is a solid place to start when looking for upgrades from Innistrad.

1. [Magic the PROthering: Brad Nelson](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/magic-the-prothering-brad-nelson/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

[Brad Nelson. So hot right now. Brad Nelson.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV_hDyfmEw4) One day after [partnering with Evan Erwin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUp0xGSRTco) for live set reviews, Nelson is once again all up in our virtual faces on Magic the Amateuring. Hear about his career ups and downs, how he stays on top of his Standard game, and what Gerry Thompson's smoke detector sounds like.


1. [Following the Emraklues](http://sarpadianempiresvol-viii.tumblr.com/post/142012718763/following-the-emraklues) | Sarpadian Empires Vol. VIII | Andrew Weisel

I almost hate rewarding a pun like this, but I'll allow it in this case, since Andrew Weisel went pretty deep combing through artwork and other clues to uncover the mystery in Innistrad. Like, deep, deep. So if you want a lot of the work done for you, start here!


And no, I won't say if he's right or wrong.


What to Watch
=============


1. [Wizards of the Coast Facebook Prerelease Stream](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering/)

So, we're going to try something today. At 4 p.m. PT (7 p.m. ET) we'll be streaming, [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering/), from the Wizards of the Coast internal Prerelease. The stream is going to be light, fun, and full of *Shadows over Innistrad*. It's scheduled to last about 15 minutes and will star, who else, Wizards of the Coast people. If you're lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of my handsome face. Or my angry face. Depends how the Prerelease is going.


Magic in the News
=================


1. [Inside a Massive *Magic: The Gathering* Grand Prix Tournament](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2016-03-30/massive-magic-the-gathering-grand-prix-tournament) |Bloomberg.com | Dimitra Kessenides and Danny Ghitis

Follow this photographic essay inside [Grand Prix Washington, D.C.](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpdc16), where a Bloomberg photographer captured some cool angles on our community, our players, and our stories.


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad*: Madness, werewolves, and gothic horror descend upon *Magic*](http://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2016/03/shadows-over-innistrad-magic-the-gathering-review/) | ArsTechnica UK | Kyle Chapman

Not really aimed at hard-core, dedicated fans, this article is still a pretty good guide to our newest set, plus a review of how they think the set performs. It's always interesting to see a non-*Magic* outlet talk about *Magic*.

The *Legendary Cube* has returned full of all kinds of, well, legendary things you can do—like trapping Avacyn and [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) in the [Helvault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault). And while people were posting cool pictures like the one above, others were expressing both [excitement](https://twitter.com/MelissaDeTora/status/715305029985415168) and [disappointment](https://twitter.com/meddlingmage/status/715348568249380864) with this iteration, leading to a longer discussion with [Worth Wollpert (head *MTGO* guy) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mtgworth/status/715384432094367744) about the merits of this and other cubes.


My own experience is that I played it a bunch last time around and generally enjoyed myself, and I've played the latest iteration once so far and drafted a [fantastic Enchantress deck](https://twitter.com/blakepr/status/715328296016150528) that made me excited to play it again. Mostly I included this paragraph to show off that photo.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [White-Black Delirium Control](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13184&writer=Melissa+DeTora&articledate=3-28-2016)

Two of the most powerful delirium cards, [Mindwrack Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindwrack+Demon) and [Descend upon the Sinful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descend+upon+the+Sinful), caught the attention of Melissa DeTora—so much so that she looked for several ways to make them work. One of her attempts was this cool [Demonic Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact) deck that looks to live off [Demonic Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact) until [Anguished Unmaking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anguished+Unmaking) or [Angelic Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Purge) can get rid of it...or until opponents just die to [Mindwrack Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindwrack+Demon).


There's a lot ways to use your life total and to replenish it, giving the deck an odd sort of life-total synergy. Plus, giving Sorin a [Demonic Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact) to play around with, and a new Angel to watch over him, is all very flavorful.
