As we showed you [two weeks ago](/en/articles/archive/dark-ascension-promo-cards-2012-01-09), *Dark Ascension* will have the usual alternate-art promo cards for the Prerelease. And since the Prerelease is this weekend, why not look at the regular art and the alternate art? Right? Why *not* do that? Exactly! It'll be a chance to see how two different artists interpret the same art description!

### Ravenous Demon


> 
> Color: Black creature
> 
> 
> Location: A cavern lit by firelight
> 
> 
> Action: Show a "young" demon with no wings in a cavern lit by firelight. See the reference for tone of demon, but design one is slightly smaller, less powerful and with no wings. A human cultist (male or female) is in the foreground, in partial silhouette only. The human should wear the same head covering as in the reference. The demon stares at the human hungrily.
> 
> 
> Focus: The demon
> 
> 
> Mood: Your sacrifice will complete me, servant.
>

### Archdemon of Greed


> 
> Color: Black creature
> 
> 
> Location: Outside at night.
> 
> 
> Action: This is the Ravenous Demon transformed into an enormous demon with wings. The camera looks up at him as he flies/soars above in the night sky. This is a very large demonâ€”at least eight feet tall with a broad, muscular body. His gigantic wings are fully extended. His wings are "new," perfect and untattered.
> 
> 
> Focus: The huge demon.
> 
> 
> Mood: He strikes fear into the hearts of even those who worship him.
>
