I can still remember the first time I saw a *Legends* card. Settle down, grandkids, and Poppy will tell you all about it…

| *Nicol Bolas! And the children all said, "Oooohhhh!"* |

It was when I had been playing for about a year, and a friend of mine with a deeper collection joined our tiny group. He wowed us with our first views of [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin) and [Maze of Ith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith), inspired us with an [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Flash) -- [Death Pits of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Pits+of+Rath) combo, and depressed us with a few infinite-mana tricks he knew.

The first *Legends* card he played was [Nicol Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas), which came screaming out under a [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) with [Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) on the board. Two of his opponents took seven damage and lost their hands. The rest of us stared at the color of the card: it was *gold*.

All those different color symbols, all together in the top left corner of the card! How was this possible? And what was with the 7/7 flyer? And it was a Legend…*and* a Dragon…*and* an Elder! Freak out.

For the next couple of weeks, I did as much research as I could into Mr. Bolas’s amazing expansion. I figured if *this* legend was good, the set *Legends* must be, well, stellar!

Unfortunately, most of my readers will be able to guess the end to this sad tale. Beyond a few boutique cards -- [Sol'Kanar the Swamp King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol%27Kanar+the+Swamp+King), [Nebuchadnezzar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nebuchadnezzar), [Xira Arien](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xira+Arien) -- there are very few legends in *Legends* that lived up to the hype that [Nicol Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas) started for us. There are some extremely efficent non-legend gems -- I am still dying to get my hands on four [Thunder Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Spirit)s -- but for the most part, the rarer creatures in the set are a massive disappointment. (I always love hearing grizzled veterans of the game talk about the “Golden Age” of **Magic**, when the game was new, honey flowed out of **Magic** packs without getting any of the cards sticky, and nobody knew better than to get all excited about opening [Pixie Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pixie+Queen) and [Boris Devilboon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boris+Devilboon). Oh, to have a time machine and relive the joy…)

But one thing Wizards did get right back then was Enchant Worlds.

### WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE

A quick primer/refresher: Enchant Worlds work like regular global enchantments, with the exception that there may never be more than one in play at the same time. When an Enchant World comes into play, any other Enchant Worlds (and there really only ought to be one) go away as a state-based effect.

And no, you may not bring them all into play using [Replenish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Replenish) or some other clever trick -- if they all come into play at the same time, they all go back to the graveyard.

*Legends* was the first set to have Enchant Worlds , and the trend continued through the *Mirage* block. (Many a multiplayer game has seen [Bazaar of Wonders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Wonders) played as part of a control-win condition.)

But what is amazing about the twelve Enchant Worlds in Legends is that they are *all* sturdy multiplayer cards. Every single one can form the basis of at least one playable group deck. And with a statement like that, I suppose I had better back it up.

### WORLDLY COUNSEL

I’ve ranked the twelve cards below in ascending order of power in multiplayer. Please don’t get too excited if my #3 is your #1; when I got around the top six, I found that any system I used to rank them was incredibly subjective and/or arbitrary.

Each entry has the beginnings of a deck. I would prefer to leave the rounding out to each of you. Experiment, tweak, and have fun. I realize that getting four, or even two, of many of these cards can be difficult. But it’s not impossible, and focusing on one or two that you really like can lead to some good times. Some of them, like [Land's Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land%27s+Edge) and [Concordant Crossroads](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concordant+Crossroads), were reprinted in *Chronicles* and shouldn't be too difficult to acquire. (After this list, I’ll share an idea on what to do if you only have one copy of many of these.)

**12. GRAVITY SPHERE** 


![Gravity Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gravity+Sphere) Flyers are a rather common staple in multiplayer games. [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane) is not the only way to deal with them. A simple grounding is often all that’s required. Fairly efficient, and almost always useful, a [Gravity Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravity+Sphere) can be complemented by red’s universal ground-damage cards -- and, of course, your own cards that bestow flying (and perhaps other abilities) selectively.***Partial Deck -- Gravitron.deq***

**11. CAVERNS OF DESPAIR** 

![Caverns of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Caverns+of+Despair) The grandfather to *Invasion*’s [Dueling Grounds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dueling+Grounds), the Caverns count on you having bigger and better creatures than your opponents. I do prefer the more restrictive green-white enchantment to this one; but if you like to play a more aggressive color, you might start with the following skeleton to your deck:***Partial Deck -- Cavepingers.deq***  

4 [Caverns of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caverns+of+Despair)

4 [Thalakos Mistfolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalakos+Mistfolk)

**10. FIELD OF DREAMS** 

![Field of Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Field+of+Dreams) This card appeals to a very narrow set of players who enjoy very precise interactions. While some benefit is gained from the knowledge itself, the real joy is in making people pay for simply knowing what’s coming. At the same time, you can find cards that give you the chance to draw additional cards, or even change the targeting structure of the game, if you have the same insight.***Partial Deck -- UnevenField.deq***

**9. STORM WORLD** 

![Storm World](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Storm+World) This card has been “given away” to the artifact world in the form of [Rackling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rackling) and [Wheel of Torture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Torture). There are subtle differences, of course -- the way it hits the controller too, and the timing of the damage. The fact that the card is red (and red is not exactly stellar at restocking cards) makes a building a deck a real challenge. At least, having extra “useless” copies of this Enchant World in your hand will help prevent damage!***Partial Deck -- ReStorm.deq***

**8. IN THE EYE OF CHAOS** 

![In the Eye of Chaos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=In+the+Eye+of+Chaos) While limited in scope (instants only), this may be an excellent card to have a few of as players start going [Radiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiate)-crazy for the next couple of months. This can be a powerful card; but any deck is going to have a “reactive” flavor that may not suit a larger multiplayer environment. My take here will be downplaying blue’s instant [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s (which would cost more) and focusing on the permanents that provide counter protection.***Partial Deck -- PokeInTheEye.deq***

**7. REVELATION** 

![Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Revelation) The primary benefit to the sort of knowledge granted by [Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation), especially in green, is that you can weigh your fat -- and then weigh your chances of getting your fat out for long enough to swing. I use it below to help you time the drawbacks of certain green cards that share benefits. This way, you can be more sure that everyone won’t have too much of a good time at your expense.***Partial Deck -- GreenParty.deq***

**6. ARBORIA** 

![Arboria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arboria) This is where the real power cards start. [Arboria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arboria) rewards those players who already have board position by making them impervious to attack. The fact that there are often other paths to victory present at any given group’s table (milling, burn, etc.) means that an [Arboria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arboria) deck will have to pay careful attention to shutting and locking those doors. One single white card will suffice. (You could also use blue and [Deflection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflection)-style cards; but I’m trying to spread across multiple colors, here… and I just realized for the first time as I wrote this article that *none* of these enchant worlds is white.)Of course, [Arboria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arboria) doesn’t stop anyone from taking advantage of activated abilities…

4 [Questing Phelddagrif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Questing+Phelddagrif)

**5. LAND’S EDGE** 

![Land's Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Land%27s+Edge) One of the best-known combos among old-school players is [Land's Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land%27s+Edge) and [Land Tax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax). While that certainly contributes to the high ranking here, an even more timely reason is the amazing interaction with madness cards. I’ll stick to that theme for the partial deck. Apologies for using “4 [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla)” and “4 [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm)” in two decks within the same article, but who are we kidding: the interaction is insane. To make up for it, I put [Rites of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Spring), so that with a [Land's Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land%27s+Edge) out, you can play four Rootwallas and then deal eight damage, all for the low, low price of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif).***Partial Deck -- RootwallaRites.deq***

**4. NETHER VOID** 

![Nether Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nether+Void) The Void is one of the ultimate slowdown cards, especially when played on turn two with a [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual). I’d like to play this with a bunch of stuff that can’t be countered by abilities. (The Void’s counter is a triggered ability.) We’ll cross a couple of colors, but it should be worth it. We even get a green counterspell -- [Avoid Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avoid+Fate) -- that should protect the Void from unnecessary abuse.***Partial Deck -- CounterCounter.deq***

**3. CONCORDANT CROSSROADS** 

![Concordant Crossroads](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Concordant+Crossroads) Who can pass up the chance to play four successive [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) on turn two? (Or turn one, if you have a [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond) or some such.) Okay, that may not sound impressive; but the [Thorn Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorn+Elemental), [Pit Spawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Spawn), [Shivan Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Hellkite), [Serra Avatar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avatar), or [Palinchron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palinchron) you hard-cast on turn three will get sufficient attention. Let’s set aside the practical considerations of how you’ll protect that early creature, and just dream for a while:***Partial Deck -- FatCrossroads.deq***

**2. LIVING PLANE** 

![Living Plane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Living+Plane) The original “[Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) = [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon)” card. The same guy I mentioned at the start of this article did the ol’ [Simoon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simoon) trick with a [Living Plane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Plane), which is well-worn but probably still one of the slickest acts in existence. Here, we’ll explore the possibilities with other red cards.(Incidentally, I tried a combination with [Cultural Exchange](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultural+Exchange) first, but I couldn’t come up with enough fodder. That could be fairly funny, though, exchanging two opponents’ lands so that they couldn’t cast a darn thing.)

**1. THE ABYSS** 

![The Abyss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=The+Abyss) The classic control card. [The Abyss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Abyss) is a natural fit with artifact creature decks, or creatureless decks…or three-color decks? Sure, why not? In fact, why not all three? Here’s a variant of a three-color, creatureless deck that my brother-in-law and I designed not long ago with, yes, artifact creatures:***Partial Deck -- ChimericAbyss.deq***

4 [Illusion/Reality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusion%2FReality)

Laugh if you will at the split card; but that is no joke. And with the “[Tainted Wood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tainted%2BWood)” uncommon lands in *Torment*, it’s easier to play in this deck than ever! The fact is, the black component of the deck takes care of just about everything except players with “rare-color” creatures and other players’ artifacts. Just when your opponents think you’ve got fewer answers than Kenneth Lay, BANG!…out comes [Illusion/Reality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusion%2FReality) to stop that noise. That card oughta be restricted. While you’re running green, throw in a couple of [Emerald Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emerald+Charm)s to work over enemy enchantments.

### OLD WORLD, NEW WORLD

Unless you have an amazing collection, you may not be able to access all of the cards you need to explore those wacky ideas above. But take heart: you can still enjoy the lovely glow of Enchant Worlds. And here’s the kicker -- you don’t even need actual Enchant Worlds!

Make a small deck of 20-25 global enchantments and artifacts. Here is the single criterion each should meet: the card uses continuous abilities only, and only those that do *not* refer to a “target”, or to “you.” (The “you” can be printed on the card, or implicit in the ability.) So [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren), [Humility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humility), and [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath) are in; [Dawn of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+of+the+Dead), [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge), and [Pyromania](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromania) are out. Sprinkle in some real Enchant Worlds, if you like; don’t forget that some expansions beyond *Legends* have them too.

Some creatures have continuous abilities that work right, like [Marble Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marble+Titan). If you’re feeling peppy, those are fine.

Put this “enchant world” deck into the center of the table face down. Before the first player’s turn, flip over the first card. That effect is a game rule that cannot be disenchanted or otherwise removed. Play your game (and any basic format will work here -- chaos, attack left, hunt, team, whatever). Right before that first player takes her next turn, flip over the next card. That new effect replaces the old one.

There are variants, of course. You can make the “flipping” more frequent (e.g., each turn) or less (e.g., by rolling a die and only flipping the card on odds or evens). Some groups never switch them automatically, but allow players to skip turns or pay 5 life to flip the effect. You can also let the worlds “stack,” by not removing the old ones as new ones come in. I wouldn’t recommend letting more than two stay on the board, however. Trying to track what happens when you have [Price of Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Price+of+Glory), [Storm Cauldron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Cauldron), and [Warped Devotion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warped+Devotion) all on the board at once can be fairly mind-blowing.

Most players, when building a world deck like this, tend to pick slow “control” cards like [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb). Try to put in an equal (or at least decent) amount of aggressive global effects, like [Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakening) and [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine). That keeps games moving, so that turns happen more quickly and more new worlds can be experienced. And that’s what we’re after, right?
