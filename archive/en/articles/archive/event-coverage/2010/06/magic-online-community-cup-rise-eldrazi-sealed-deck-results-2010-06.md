Here's how the scoring works: For the two Limited formats and Standard, there will be three rounds of Swiss pitting a member of one team against a player from the other team. Your first match win in a format is worth 4 points, your second win 6, and third win 7, meaning that a single player can contribute up to 17 points to his or her team's score in a format. For Commander, players will be placed in four-person pods (two players per team). The winning player earns 17 points, second place is 10, third place 4, and fourth place is worth zero points. Whichever team has a higher total points after all four formats will be declared the winner!


CC Points listed below are cumulative by player. Due to scheduling conflicts, only two rounds of *Rise of the Eldrazi* Sealed Deck were played.
