With [Grand Prix Moscow](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-moscow-2014-coverage-events) taking center stage last weekend, it's time for us to take another look at the *Magic: The Gathering* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Lee Shi Tian was the star name on show at the Grand Prix, alongside the Siberian master Dmitriy Butakov, a former *Magic Online* Champion. With a small field and a known Standard format, it seemed like a great opportunity for the best to rise to the top. Butakov was always front and center, ending Day One at 8–0 before going on to reach the Top 8.


For Lee Shi Tian, however, the path was far less straightforward. With three byes, any winning record would be enough to advance him to Day Two, but with opening defeats to Keraan Chetty (who would go on to the Top 8) and Sergey Volkov, he was in deep trouble. With Round 8 winding down, a draw seemed inevitable, before an unfortunate disqualification saw him squeak into Day Two. High-level *Magic* is all about making the most of opportunities, and Lee didn't look back, piling his way through Day Two to the Top 8. Although his run ended in the quarterfinals, the Pro Points were still good enough to send Lee up five places in the rankings to No. 11.


With Moscow now in the books, we turn our attention back to North America, where we can expect to see many of the biggest names on display at Grand Prix Chicago. Will someone take Igor Gorbunov's Boros Burn deck and pilot it to victory? Or is there room in Chicago for control to dominate Standard? As always, we'll be back with you next week to discuss the movers and shakers on the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
