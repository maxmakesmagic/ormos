It's Abzan Week here at DailyMTG.com, and we plan to leave no stone unturned in our mission to explore the Abzan from top to bottom. No barrier can stop us from exploring all that is the Abzan wedge.



Well, except maybe these:

The Abzan, defensive stalwarts that they are, are anything but shy about hiding behind their walls. But there's more happening on those walls than you might be able to tell. You see, their defensive capabilities aren't all brick and mortar. These walls call upon the Abzan soldiers they protect.



From the art description for [Dazzling Rampart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dazzling+Rampart):



Clan: Abzan


Color: White creature


Location: Sunny day in the desert


Action: Show an exterior wall of an Abzan fortress. Abzan soldiers along the top of the wall hold mirrors that catch the sun's light, sending dazzling, blinding light down toward the ground. It looks so bright that anyone who approached these walls would be instantly blinded.


Focus: The wall and the mirrors


Mood: A clever Abzan defense employed against the other clans

[Archers' Parapet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archers%27+Parapet), similarly, also calls upon the soldiers it shelters:



Clan: Abzan


Color: Green


Location: A foliage-covered tower of an Abzan fortress


Action: This is an Abzan tower manned by human archers. They fire their bows into the air, and the arrows have begun to arc down and "hit" the viewer.


Focus: The plant-covered tower and its archers


Mood: We probably shouldn't have tried to attack this side of the fortress.

Walls are a bit less common these days than they used to be, but *Magic 2015* certainly paved the way for a minor Wall renaissance. Abzan alone (before Abzan really existed) received these three imposing and efficient walls.

No soldiers pacing the tops of these three, but between the five walls we've looked at here, it's actually possible to build a pretty passable defensive fort in Standard worthy of the Abzan clan. Although, interestingly enough, there are more blue walls in Standard (three—[Mnemonic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall), [Wall of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost), and [Coral Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Barrier)) than any other color. Maybe blue has a bit of Abzan running through its veins after all.



Whatever the case, they can all agree on one thing—watch out for this guy…
