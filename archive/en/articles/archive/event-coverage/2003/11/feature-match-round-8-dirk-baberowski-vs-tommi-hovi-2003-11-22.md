Tommi admitted having practiced very little for this event ' about 5 *Mirrodin* drafts' however he is in with a good chance of making day two. Standing between him and this goal is the **Magic** community's favourite travel agent Dirk Baberowski (he can also play magic a bit too).

Both players led off with mountains but Dirk had the first action with a [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) and a [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) whilst Tommi was happy just to make lands. Tommi's first play was to make a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) to which Dirk responded with a [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard). Tommi attempted to wrest the tempo away from the German with a [Looming Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Hoverguard) which traded in combat with the [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard). Tommi was not done making big flyers as on his next turn he made a[Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) which was dispatched by an [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt). Dirk was however lacking creatures and was unable to deal with a [Pewter Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) and was reduced to taking damage, Tommi increased the pressure with a [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) and despite another [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) and a [Molder Slug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug) from Dirk, Tommi was able to play [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) on the Myr to clear a path for a lethal attack.

Tommi Hovi 1 - Dirk Baberowski 0 

Both players started this game with turn two Myrs. Tommi used his to accelerate out a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) once again whilst dirk used his to play a [Granite Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard) and kill Tommi's Myr. Tommi's next play was a [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard) which was used to attack Dirk down to 15 Dirk responded with a [Hematite Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem) which decided to play defense rather than start a damage race. Tommi played a [Skeleton Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeleton+Shard)s and a [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) to set himself up for the long game whilst Dirk was only able to animate his [Stalking Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) during his end phase. Then on his turn he played the very fat [Trolls of Tel-Jilad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trolls+of+Tel-Jilad) which were unable however to stop the [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard) being equipped with a [Mask of Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Memory) to provide card advantage as well as the effective clock that they already were. Dirk realized that he needed to shake the game up as it was slipping away from him so he played a [Vulshok Battlegear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear), suited up his [Stalking Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) and sent the now 6/6 land and the Trolls into the red zone. Tommi however was able to blunt the attack by blocking with the [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) and then returning it to his hand with the [Skeleton Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeleton+Shard)s. 'Oh look a combination' remarked Dirk who was putting a brave face on what was quite a savage beating which was completed by a [Looming Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Hoverguard) from Tommi.

Tommi Hovi Beats Dirk Baberowski 2-0

After the match Dirk questioned if he should have sideboarded in his white cards over his red ones though after losing the game that they played out sideboarded that way he was forced to admit that it probably made no difference.
