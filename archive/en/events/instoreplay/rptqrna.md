General Information
-------------------


**Tournament Structure** 


The structure for Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers is modified Swiss-style.


**Tournament Length and Advancement** 


* Swiss rounds will be 50 minutes in length.
* Single-elimination playoff matches will have no time limit.
* Number of Swiss rounds based on attendance according to the following chart:



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attendance | Swiss rounds | Playoff |
| 8 | 3 Rounds (Single Elimination) | n/a |
| 9—16 | 4 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 17—32 | 5 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 33—64 | 6 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 65—93 | 7 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 94—128 | 7 Rounds | None |
| 129—226 | 8 Rounds | None |
| 227—409 | 9 Rounds | None |
| 410 or higher | 10 Rounds | None |

Because Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers award invitations based on total attendance, the number of single-elimination matches that are to be played after the Swiss rounds is determined based on as follows:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Attendance | How Many Single-Elimination Matches? |
| 8-16 Players | Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Finals |
| 17-46 Players | Quarterfinals and Semifinals |
| 47-93 Players | Quarterfinals Only |
| 94+ Players | No Single-Elimination Matches (Swiss Only) |

**Format** 


* Modern Constructed.
* Decklists are required.

**Playoff** 


* Playoff matches, if necessary, will be best two of three.
* Playoff matches will be single-elimination.
* While there are no time limits in the playoff rounds, players are expected to play at a reasonable pace and finish their matches within 60 minutes.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the player who finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
* The  [*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules)  and the  [*Magic: The Gathering* Infraction Procedure Guide](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide)  are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this Fact Sheet.
* Players are responsible for bringing their own method of tracking life totals and appropriate counters or tokens.

**Entry Fee** 


Entry fees for Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers vary from organizer to organizer. Contact the tournament organizer of the Regional Pro Tour Qualifier you are planning to attend for exact information.


Prizes

The top finishing players at each Regional Pro Tour Qualifier will receive an invitation and [travel award](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/travel-award-faq)\* to Pro Tour *Ravnica Allegiance*.

\*Travel


The players eligible to receive a travel award will receive instructions from Wizards of the Coast regarding whom they must contact and the deadline by which they must arrange their travel awards. Wizards of the Coast will not refund travel made outside this service. Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to award a cash equivalent award in lieu of any travel award in its sole discretion.


All travel itineraries must be from the international airport nearest the player's home and to the host city of the Pro Tour, and must include all the dates of that event. No award will be substituted if member is unable to participate. All other expenses are the responsibility of the member and may include, without limitation, accommodations, ground transportation, taxes, itinerary change fees, passport and visa fees.


This award must be redeemed through member's arrangement of travel itinerary no later than thirty (30) days before departure. Failure to complete travel arrangements as directed by Wizards of the Coast prior to this deadline will result in forfeiture of the award. Every member receiving a travel award must provide to Wizards of the Coast an executed liability release, the appropriate US taxation form (W9 or W8) (or have one on file), [up-to-date contact information on your DCI membership](http://accounts.wizards.com), and proof of ID and passport (when required by international destination). In all cases, all such documentation must be provided to Wizards of the Coast, or must have been previously on file, at least thirty (30) days before departure. Failure to timely provide such documentation will result in forfeiture of the award.


Players under the age of eighteen (18) at the time of the Pro Tour will receive a cash equivalent award in lieu of expenses, paid air ticket, and/or hotel accommodations. Such player must still attend, compete, and be listed in the finish of the tournament or forfeit this award.


Players who have general questions about the *Magic: The Gathering* trading card game, Wizards of the Coast LLC, the Wizards Play Network, or any *Magic: The Gathering* Organized Play program should contact Wizards of the Coast as follows:


* In North and South America, access the [Knowledge Base](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).
* In all other areas, go to the [Global Contact Information Page](http://company.wizards.com/contact-us).


*Magic Online* Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers

The first will take place on December 8 at 2 p.m. PT, and the second one will take place December 15 at 5 a.m. PT.


To register for a *Magic Online* Regional Pro Tour Qualifier, a player who is qualified to compete in that round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers must send an email to [PremierPlay@wizards.com](mailto:PremierPlay@wizards.com) with the following elements:


* The title of the email should be "*Magic Online* RPTQ."

The format for these Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers is Modern.


As a reminder, if you have already played in a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier during a qualifying round,  **you cannot play in any other Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers during that qualifying round, including *Magic Online* Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers** .
