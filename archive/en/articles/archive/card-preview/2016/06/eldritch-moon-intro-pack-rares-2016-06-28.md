Not too long ago we announced that, starting with *Kaladesh*, [we would be introducing something called Planeswalker Decks](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ramp-approval-2016-05-16). Planeswalker Decks will serve as ramps for new players to get into the game.


That means that *Eldritch Moon* will be your last opportunity to pick up Intro Packs with any release. If you enjoy Intro Packs, this will be your last chance to grab them, so let's take a look at the rares that will grace the cover of each Intro Pack.

Normally, in this article we'd also show the other promos, but we're going to hold off a bit on those for now. Mysteries and all that, you know.
