The July 20, 2017 Update

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 20, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by 365 days of streaming, and what must be a comfortable chair.


What to Watch Today *and* Tomorrow
==================================


1. Caleb Durward Completes 365 Days | [twitch.tv/calebmtg](https://www.twitch.tv/calebdmtg) | 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. UTC

Caleb Durward, marathon man, is completing his 365th day of streaming, and is celebrating with a 24-hour stream starting this afternoon. He'll start with the Streamer Showdown and then continue right on till tomorrow. And after that, hopefully he'll take a vacation. But maybe he'll just play more *Magic*. We'll find out in just over 24 hours.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Hour of Devastation* First Impressions](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-398-hour-of-devastation-first-impressions/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Coming in at a brisk 1 hour 13 minutes, Marshall and Luis cover the new format and bask in the ability to play something other than two-drops.


1. [My 2017 Pro Tour Hall of Fame Ballot](https://www.channelfireball.com/home/my-hall-of-fame-2017-ballot/) | ChannelFireball | Hélène Bergeot

I've been mostly avoiding the "my ballot" articles, but this one is a can't-miss if you care about the Hall of Fame. Hélène Bergeot used to run the thing, after all. Now she comes back as a voting member of the public to share her thoughts on the Hall, the discussion around it, and who she's voting for this year. You'll be excused if you read the whole thing with her accent in your head. We all do.


1. [Against the Odds: Desert Tribal (Standard)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-desert-tribal-standard?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

SaffronOlive gets his just deserts while wandering through Standard. The deck shows real promise, even in a hostile metagame. The results weren't splendid, but the effort was clearly tireless cultivating this deck.


1. [Exalted Episode 6: In Defense of Wizards](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-php7b-6d3084#.WXA2qMIYNC4.twitter) | Eyes on the Mise | John Wells

This guy gets us. He might be in the minority, but he gets us.


1. [Top 10 Best/Most Played *Hour of Devastation* Cards in Standard for *Magic: The Gathering*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxXoANpgYk&feature=youtu.be&a) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Wedge combed through a ton of decklists to compile a list of the most played *Hour of Devastation* cards. Number 1 will surprise you!


Actually, it probably won't. It makes a ton of sense.

1. [*Magic: The Gathering* – Story Break Podcast #14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrYaOtMIqlY) | RocketJump | Will Campos, Matt Arnold, and Freddie Wong

Story Break is a non-*Magic* podcast (*gasp!*) that breaks down stories for various properties, with special guest and friend of the Update Jimmy Wong. Today, they tackle *Magic*. While the whole show is great, my favorite segment was when the read off the names of random *Khans of Tarkir* commons to Jimmy and had their minds blown that he could recite their abilities and casting costs. Any player who drafted during that time can tell you what [Alpine Grizzly](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly) is, but it set their non-*Magic* playing minds on fire, which was endearing and fun.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> I hear you loud and clear re: "shake-up bannings" in advance of the Modern PT. No plans for that. We plan to manage the format as we do now.

> 
>  — Aaron Forsythe (@mtgaaron) [July 20, 2017](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/status/887862643645480960)

The one concern coming out of yesterday's announcements was that the Modern Pro Tour would herald a return of bannings leading up to the Pro Tour. Aaron Forsythe steps in to address that.


1. >

Only half the schedule for 2018 [was announced today](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/2018-grand-prix-details-2017-07-20)—but man, what a half. There sure are a lot of team events on there . . .


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Kwane Gunn's Red-Green Ramp](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=114835)

There's been a lot of talk about [Hour of Promise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Promise) powering out a turn-six [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger), but so far, no one seems to be able to crack it. The best performance we've seen is a 32nd place finish from Kwane Gunn with the decklist below, which, for a ramp deck, actually plays very few ramp cards.


That's because [Hour of Promise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Promise) in conjunction with [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods) does so much work getting to Ulamog that not much else is necessary. [Shefet Monitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shefet+Monitor) makes the cut because it also draws a card and always cycles for value (so, so much value). [Beneath the Sands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beneath+the+Sands) sneaks in because it speeds up [Hour of Promise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Promise) by a turn while also being cyclable when it's not needed. But that's it. Just those three ramp spells make up the quest to get to ten mana.


But that's because the deck has other tools at its disposal as well.


First, getting to ten isn't strictly necessary when [World Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker)—kind of a mini-Ulamog—exists at seven mana. Combined with [Kozilek's Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return), the deck is very good at breaking the world around turn five or six, which is enough time when [Abrade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrade) and [Magma Spray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray) are keeping the field relatively under control. And if not? Boom—four copies of Hour of Devastation.


The deck even gets to play some Deserts for maximum [Hour of Promise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Promise) synergy, turning the Hour from *just* the best [Explosive Vegetation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation) ever into an actual board presence.
