**Orry Swift (White-Blue Heroic) vs. Randall Gay (Abzan Midrange)**




 In the first game, Orry Swift powered out a [Battlewise Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Hoplite) and came hard and fast with the Auras. Aided by [Hero of Iroas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Iroas), a [Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance) when Randall Gay tried to hit a Hero's Downfall, and an [Ordeal of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) making the totals 31-6 in Swift's favor, Swift was able to take the first game with relative ease.
