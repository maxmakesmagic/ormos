A "cycle" means a slightly different thing in *Lorwyn* as it has in past sets. There are some five-card cycles around the color wheel, certainly, but many of the cycles are eight-card cycles across the *tribes*.


Today we take a look at one of these eight-card tribe cycles: the cycle of multicolor tribe legends.


### Kithkin: Gaddock Teeg


Kithkin are almost 100% white-aligned in *Lorwyn*, but they do touch a bit of green, enough for the cenn of Kinsbaile, [Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg). You can read more about Mr. Teeg in the *Lorwyn* block novels (learn more and download a sample chapter [here](http://ww2.wizards.com/books/Wizards/Products/?doc=959587400)).

### Merfolk: Sygg, River Guide


Sygg is a master captain of the Merrow Lanes, who always knows just how to get you where you're going. And blessed as he is with a healthy amount of protective magic, he always gets you there safely. Sygg is also a character in the *Lorwyn* block novels.

### Faeries: Wydwen, the Biting Gale


Wydwen is *much* too cool for you. Faeries travel in small groups called cliques—and for Wydwen, it's literally a popularity contest. She comes and goes as she desires, leaving snorted insults in her wake, and doesn't give the time of day to anybody—creature or planeswalker—who she sees as beneath her.

### Goblins: Wort, Boggart Auntie


Aunties are the tribe leaders of boggart warrens—and they're called that whether they're male or female! Wort is not the most stable personality, but she's been around long enough how to keep her boggart younglings out of danger. And if she fails—well, you can always make more boggarts.

### Elementals: Horde of Notions


The "greater elementals" on Lorwyn are manifestations of ideas and dreams in the form of surreal conglomerations of animal elements. The granddaddy of them all, [Horde of Notions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horde+of+Notions), is a *group* of these surreal conglomerations! As elementals are a five-color tribe, [Horde of Notions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horde+of+Notions) is itself all five colors. It holds answers to some of Lorwyn's deepest mysteries, and could answer deep riddles for you—if you could find where it lurks.

### Elves: Nath of the Gilt-Leaf


Nath is a taercenn, a high rank among the elves—and not a nice guy. He rides high on his cervin mount, leading hunts of eyeblights (creatures too ugly to exist) through the forests. He's the preeminent example of beauty leading to power. You can read more about him in the *Lorwyn* block novels.

### Treefolk: Doran the Siege Tower


Doran is as strong a treefolk as they come—and his power comes directly from his strength of will. Doran epitomizes the strange three-color tribe of the treefolk, centered mostly in green but also straddling white and black.

### Giants: Brion Stoutarm


Brion's abilities work perfectly together: do damage, and gain life based on the damage dealt. His mean right arm is the engine behind his reputation as a fearsome giant. You can read more about Brion (and his siblings, Kiel and Rosheen) in the *Lorwyn* block novels.
