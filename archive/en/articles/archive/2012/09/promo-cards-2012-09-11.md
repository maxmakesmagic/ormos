It is time to look at some of the promo cards that will be associated with *Return to Ravnica*. For example, *Return to Ravnica* Game Day is October 27-28, 2012. And while supplies last, everyone who plays gets this!

![Cryptborn Horror](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1057_ljcp3xren3_gameday_1.jpg)Moving backwards slightly, *Return to Ravnica* goes on sale on Friday, October 5, 2012. And because that's a Friday, there's a special card at Friday Night Magic!


![Deadbridge Goliath](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1057_ljcp3xren3_launch_1.jpg)And on October 5, the *Return to Ravnica* League starts in your local store. When it ends, the prizes include this Knight token!

To get this, simply find a participating store and reserve a box of boosters. But do it quickly, because you have to be one of the first 20 or 30 (depending on the store).


![Supreme Verdict](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1057_ljcp3xren3_box_1.jpg)And finally, we have the alternate-art Prerelease promo cards. As with previous Prereleases, you get these at the Prerelease (which is September 29-30, 2012). But there are some changes this time! First, there are five different ones, one for each guild in *Return to Ravnica*. And second, you get to play your Prerelease card *in your deck at the Prerelease*!



And here are the Prerelease cards. You might notice some similarity to the cards in the cards in the [*Return to Ravnica* Intro Packs](/en/articles/archive/return-ravnica-intro-packs-2012-09-05).
