The celebrated and wise planeswalker Teferi made his initial appearance in card names and flavor text way back in *Mirage*, in cards like [Teferi's Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Imp), [Teferi's Curse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Curse) and [Reality Ripple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Ripple). He was referenced lightly during Urza block ([Stern Proctor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stern+Proctor), [Disruptive Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disruptive+Student)) and once in Masques block (just [Excavation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Excavation) as far as we can tell), but he didn't show up in earnest in **Magic**   *art* until *Invasion*.


In that set, Teferi was depicted with a characteristic robe, headdress and staff. Check it out:


[Exclude](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Exclude)  
[Teferi's Care](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Teferi%2527s%2BCare)  
[Teferi's Moat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Teferi%2527s%2BMoat)
Note how Teferi holds back those bad guys above. Can you tell what group that's supposed to be across the moat? Here's a [hint](/en/articles/archive/symbol-phyrexia-2004-02-16).


You can also see Teferi on [Disrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupt) and [Teferi's Response](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Response), among others. (Teferi also made a [Teferi's Puzzle Box](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Teferi%2527s%2BPuzzle%2BBox) once. Look, a Puzzle Week tie-in!)
