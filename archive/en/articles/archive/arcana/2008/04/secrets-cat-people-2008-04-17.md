Let's take a break from all the *Shadowmoor* excitement for a moment, and look instead at something entirely different: cat people! To be specific, Nacatl. Our crack staff of researchers discovered this sketch that had been drawn back during the *Future Sight* concepting and we figured it was too cool not to share with you.

This is probably technically "concept art", but it was specifically drawn to get two things across to **Magic** artists. And now you, the loyal reader of **magicthegathering.com** can also learn the secrets . . . of the cat people.
