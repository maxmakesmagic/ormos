This week's "Sketches" looks at Wayne England's [Magma Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Sliver) from *Legions*. 


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Color: Red  
 Location: Skirk Ridge  
 Action: Show a large, powerful sliver with plating on its skin that appears to be made of magma & fire. These plates can have a red glow between them and be steaming.  
 Notes: See style guide for sliver concept, but bring out the special skin and some other slight variations along the same line."


The card was called "Firecoat Sliver" in playtest.


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch of "Firecoat Sliver" submitted by England. 


The art team liked the form and composition of the sliver, but wanted its volcanic nature highlighted. 


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. The end result, as you can see, has more rocky breaks in its skin and steam flowing around it.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
