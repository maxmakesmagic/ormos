*What's your best story from the M11 Prerelease?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** I played a bunch of great games with great people at the ***Magic** 2011* Prerelease this past weekend, despite being able to stick around for just a few short hours. I had to burn a staggering four cards dealing with one [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel)—[Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), [Thunder Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Strike), [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling), and [Berserkers of Blood Ridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserkers+of+Blood+Ridge)—*and then came back and won*, thanks in part to the brutal might of [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan). I also had a [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) get [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)d in another game, which was hilarious in that horrible sort of way.

Easily my most epic game, though, was against someone whose name I'm afraid I've forgotten—I don't take notes like I did during my columnist days—who looked to have an early jump on me with [Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) staring down my [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl) and freshly cast [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker). I went ahead and cast another [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), pretty confident that the Piker would die first. That second Owl set me up beautifully for my elbow-drop: a turn-six [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan), taking out the Pyromancer and a [Wild Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin) that had joined the opposing side in the interim. Not to be outdone, my opponent tapped six lands of his own and cast [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan), pulling [Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) right back out of the graveyard. Well then!

| Inferno Titan | Sun Titan |

I swung in on my turn, killing the Pyromancer again and a second [Wild Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin), offering the Titan-trade (I was Owled up and humming on all cylinders now, and had more fat in hand). My opponent declined, and took 7 to the face. But his next attack, which I blocked with a hearty new [Earth Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Servant), let him get both [Wild Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin)s on the table at once. That meant my next [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) attack could only kill one of them, which let him block and [Chandra's Outrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage) my Titan to kill it. I wasn't too worried, though, because I got to pull a similar trick on my next turn, blocking [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) with [Earth Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Servant) and [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)ing it. So no Titans for anyone then! His [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) KO'd my [Earth Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Servant), and a [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) from me finished the slaughter, wiping out the [Wild Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Griffin)s that had now at last made their final trip out of the graveyard. Now, with both of us below 10, it was a tense topdeck war ...

![Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grave+Titan)  
... that ended, unexpectedly and with grim finality, when my opponent cast [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). Three colors, two Titans? Yeah, I'll give you that one!
