Choose your allegiance carefully, Planeswalker.
-----------------------------------------------


The *Return to Ravnica* set marks the long-awaited return to the city-plane of Ravnica and its ten ancient two-color guilds. *Return to Ravnica* focuses on five guilds—Azorius, Izzet, Rakdos, Golgari, and Selesnya—but the city is home to many different races and many different intrigues. *Return to Ravnica* doesn’t just take you back to one of the most popular **Magic** settings of all time, however, this set also heralds several exciting new changes for **Magic Online** set releases!


### Play Sooner!


The **Magic** team has been working hard to better integrate paper and digital **Magic** releases, and as Ryan Spain [discussed several months ago](/en/articles/archive/shrinking-gap-2012-04-30), we are continuing to adjust **Magic** release schedules to be complete and complimentary experiences. While the last few *Duel Decks* releases have been simultaneous with their paper counterparts, *Return to Ravnica* represents the first full set that will be released under this new system and it will be available in **Magic Online** earlier than ever before!


**Magic Online** Prerelease events begin on October 13 at 12:00 AM (midnight)—right after Friday Night **Magic** ends—and will run through the weekend. As soon as the Prereleases end Monday morning at 10:00 AM, *Return to Ravnica* will be available in the **Magic Online** Store—a full week earlier than the previous schedule. In addition, *Return to Ravnica* Release Event queues (sealed deck and draft) begin the same time the set goes on sale so players won't have to wait before jumping into a draft!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/rtr-release-schedule.jpg)### Choose your Guild!


Ten guilds, each aligned with two of the five colors of magic, are vying for control of the vast city-world of Ravnica. This conflict carries over to the *Return to Ravnica* Prerelease as well. When you head to [your friendly local game store for the *Return to Ravnica* Prerelease](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts), you will declare your allegiance and get a corresponding Guild Prerelease Pack that includes five *Return to Ravnica* boosters, a guild specific booster pack, and your Prerelease promo card (along with some other goodies).


The **Magic Online** experience is very similar. You'll purchase the Guild Mark for your favorite guild from the **Magic Online** Store for $5.00 USD, and then use that Guild Mark and 20 Event Tickets to enter the *Return to Ravnica* Prerelease Sealed Deck Queue. Your Guild Mark will determine which guild booster pack and Prerelease card you get, and just like paper, you will be able to use your Prerelease card in your deck! You can check out the Guild Marks and Prerelease promo cards below. To learn more about the guilds, visit [GuildsofRavnica.com](/en/node/640376).

### Play with the Pros


*Return to Ravnica* will be available during Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* in Seattle, which means you can draft on **MTGO** while watching your favorite pros draft via our [live event coverage](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/webcast/home). In addition, with the deck export feature that accompanies all new deck lists on the [**Magic** website](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/all-team-decklists-standard-modern-innistradavacyn-restored-block), you can import your favorite Modern lists right into **Magic Online** as soon as they are available, putting the latest deck tech right at your fingertips!

### Moving Forward


This release represents an exciting step for **Magic Online**. **MTGO** players will get to experience the full *Return to Ravnica* guild experience just one week after the set is released in paper while competitive players will be able to dive into a draft earlier than ever. Players can check out the full Prerelease and Release Event details below.


Whether a first time visitor or a long time fan, have fun exploring the streets of Ravnica.

Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the *Return to Ravnica* Release Events Championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in any end-of-season championship or championship event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s).


Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [Magic Online User Agreement](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/%20http:/wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). If you play in **Magic Online** events, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established.


It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that he or she has been properly entered into this event and is able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the Championship, he or she will need to contact customer service for assistance.


**For all *Return to Ravnica* Release Events, Wizards of the Coast may modify, suspend, and/or cancel an event, substitute prizes, or change the costs and/or schedule for an event without notice, at its sole discretion.**
