**U.S. Nationals 1999 Reports**
-------------------------------

   
Round 3 Feature Match
---------------------



**Steve O'Mahoney-Shwartz vs. Darwin Kastle** 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/USNAT99/images/R3KastleOMS.JPG)With 
 both Steve and Darwin still smarting over their first losses, these 
 two titans were pitted against one another in the crucial third 
 round. 


Steve started the match by winning the die roll, but won little 
 else. Darwin's second turn Mother of Runes was followed by an Angelic 
 Page, a Capashen Templar and Capashen Knight, solidifying his defense 
 against Steve's slow UG deck. Every time Steve tried to mount an 
 offense, Darwin had an answer, dropping Tormented Angels and killing 
 Steve's Treetop Ranger and Blanchwood Treefolk, and added insult 
 to injury by killing Steve with three Waylay tokens created during 
 Steve's end phase (a new ruling made possible by sixth edition rules). 
 The game lasted thirty-five minutes, but was never in doubt. 


In game two, Steve started with a Treetop Villiage, so Darwin decided 
 not to wait until his second turn to drop the Mother of Runes. Steve's 
 frustration seemed evident in the form of a resignation to a better 
 deck, and when Darwin finally dropped his Phyrexian Plaguelord, 
 Steve was forced to get to agressive and got caught by a timely 
 Congregate. 


Steve's last hope came in the form of Yavamaya Hollows, but even 
 then, Darwin had an answer, Befouling the land. Two turns later, 
 as time was being called, Steve knew he was going to be dead within 
 Kastle's three extra turns, and scooped to save Darwin the trouble.
