 Pro Tour Hall of Fame member Brian Kibler is a media sensation. Between his popular articles and blog posts and larger-than-life presence on social media, the two-time Pro Tour champion is a one of the most renown faces of the Pro Tour. With legions of fans that even buy his likeness to play **Magic** on, you'd have to search through history to find someone that might qualify as his nemesis.



Fellow Pro Tour Hall of Fame member Darwin Kastle is that nemesis. Take, for example, this pregame conversation.


"I think the last time we played was Nationals.... 2010?" Kibler asked. 


"Yeah... something like that. We used to play a lot more," and equally unsure Kastle answered.


"You used to beat me a lot," Kibler recalled.


"That's because I used to play a lot. Also I can't believe I played both Eric Froehlich," the 22nd-ranked players, "and Josh Utter-Leyton," the 13th-ranked player, "without a getting a feature match. I guess it took you to elevate me here."


"Well, neither of them are in the Hall of Fame," was the pithy finishing quip from Kibler, who was sporting his team's BUG Control deck that you saw in Round 6's Feature Match with Luis-Scott Vargas. Kastle, however, took a more direct approach.





*Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle and Brian Kibler have been longtime rivals on the Pro Tour, with Kibler's lifetime record against Kastle being abysmal. Would he be able to change that around today?*
