WHAT HAPPENS AT GAME DAY?
-------------------------


At Game Day you'll be paired up to face other players in multiple rounds of friendly competition. Each round, you'll play a best-of-three match and report the winner to the organizer.


Game Day events are many players' first experiences with competitive *Magic*. They offer a great opportunity to test your skills against your local *Magic* community in a fun, relaxed environment.


You'll need:


* Your own Standard deck, which is a minimum of 60 cards and has a sideboard of up to 15 cards.
* A method for tracking life totals, as well as tokens, counters, and card sleeves.

PRIZES
------


Each participant in the Game Day tournament receives a full-art promo card, and each player in the Top 8 receives a premium foil full-art promo card, while supplies last.


The winner of each Game Day tournament receives a special Champion playmat to commemorate their victory.


Additional prizes may be offered by local independent tournament organizers. Check with your organizer for additional information.
