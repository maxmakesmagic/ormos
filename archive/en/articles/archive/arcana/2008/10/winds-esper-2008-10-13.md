As a quick glance through the *Shards of Alara* card list will show, the people of Esper love their devices. Well, technically they *are* devices, but that's not what we mean. We're talking about the [capsules](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=capsule&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=All%20sets), [Etherium Astrolabe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Etherium%2BAstrolabe), and [Mindlock Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mindlock%2BOrb) that have been built to measure... something.

Many of the devices, like the [Etherium Astrolabe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Astrolabe), exist to measure the twenty-three winds of Esper. This wind is considered by the Vedalken to have mystical significance, and who's to say they're wrong? They *are* superintelligent magicians, after all. They might be onto something.

Here are a few cards where the wind itself can be seen either having an effect or being measured:
