On Monday, October 27, at 7:00 p.m. through Tuesday, October 28, at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, several Wizards of the Coast services will be offline for a scheduled upgrade of the account system. **During this time, *Magic Online* should remain available to players.** That said, several *Magic Online*-related services will be unavailable during this time. They are:




* *Magic: the Gathering* [Community Site](http://community.wizards.com/magic-the-gathering)
* *Magic Online* [Customer Help](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-reimbursement-requests-and-bug-reporting)
* [*Magic Online* Home Page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/magic-online) (intermittent outages only, on Tuesday, October 28)


As always, if players need *Magic Online* support, ORCs will be available to assist in-client. However, we will be unable to process [Reimbursement requests](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-reimbursement-requests-and-bug-reporting) and [issue reporting](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-reimbursement-requests-and-bug-reporting) until Wizards services are restored on October 28, at 7:00 p.m. We encourage players to submit any issues or reimbursement requests that arise during this downtime, but they will have to wait to do so until after the scheduled downtime has ended, and services are restored.


As noted above, the [*Magic* Website](http://magic.wizards.com/) will have limited availability on Tuesday, October 28, so we will be communicating updates to *Magic Online* players primarily via the [*Magic Online* Twitter](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline) account and through in-client messaging.
