“One of the long-term lessons of **Magic** design and development has been that the game thrives when there are strict delineations. Having every color do everything is bad for the game. So is letting every card type do everything. We should figure out what we want each card type to do and then let it have its own design space. This is more restrictive but I believe restrictions breed creativity. And in the end we get a tighter and I believe more aesthetic game.”
