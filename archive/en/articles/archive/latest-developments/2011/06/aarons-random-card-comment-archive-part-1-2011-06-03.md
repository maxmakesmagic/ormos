*Director of **Magic** R&D Aaron Forsythe maintains an active presence in the community, primarily through his Twitter account, @[mtgaaron](http://twitter.com/#!/mtgaaron). One occasional feature on his Twitter feed is Aaron's Random Card Comment of the Day, or #arccd. For each Random Card Comment, Aaron uses the [Random Card](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random) button in Gatherer, then heads into the Discussion tab for that card and writes a short commentary on it—no matter what it is (except for basic lands, as discussed in ARCCD #16).*


*The result is something like 30,000 words of frank and fascinating commentary from [the big brain at the center of R&D](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleemax)—er, I mean, the* other *big brain at the center of R&D. Within, you can get Aaron's take on black haste, resonant fantasy, development mistakes, products of their era, and, yes, even [Beast Walkers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Walkers) (which Aaron refers to, not unfairly, as "a dumpster fire"), along with a huge number of other things.*


*Here, collected in one place for the first time, are the first 25 Aaron's Random Card Comments. We're divvying them up for your protection—if you've ever tried to drink out of a firehose you know what I'm talking about—but if you really want to dive in, you can find all the cards Aaron has commented on [here](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&user=+%5BAaron_Forsythe%5D).*


**Magic: The Gathering** Commander *previews start on Monday, and you can join guest author Mark Globus next week here in Latest Developments for the scoop on* **Magic: The Gathering** Commander*, including an exclusive preview card!*
