 It was a clash of former Top 8'ers here in the early rounds of Day 2. Japan's Ken Yukuhiro put up a Top 4 finish at Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*, and is one of the newest wave of Japanese talent. He lives and breathes *Magic*, spending his time split between running his store and streaming *Magic Online*.




 Opposite him sat Joel Larsson of Sweden. He rose to prominence under the Sunday lights at Pro Tour *Gatecrash*, making it all the way to the finals before being defeated by Champion Tom Martell. Both players were drawing on the power of white in their draft decks, the consensus most powerful color in *Magic 2015*. Larsson paired his with red and sacrificed his long game for more explosive power. Yukuhiro added black to his mix, as well as a splash of blue.




**What's at Stake?**



Both players were sitting at 7-2, an enviable position. Yukuhiro had passed a relatively quiet year on the circuit, and this start gave him a good shot at reaching the Top 25 finish he needs to secure Gold Pro Status for the coming season.
