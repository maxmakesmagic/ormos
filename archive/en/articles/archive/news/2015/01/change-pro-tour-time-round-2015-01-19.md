Starting with Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* in Washington, DC, Wizards of the Coast is reducing the length of Swiss rounds at the Pro Tour from 55 minutes to 50 minutes. Pro Tour days have been getting longer in recent seasons and this change is in the interest of providing a better experience for players at the Pro Tour with minimal impact on the structure. Additionally, this will ensure more consistency at our Professional-level tournaments by having rounds times the same as Grand Prix tournaments.
