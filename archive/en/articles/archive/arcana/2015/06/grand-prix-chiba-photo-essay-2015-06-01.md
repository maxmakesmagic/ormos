With the largest Grand Prix in Japan's history, the fastest main event of a Grand Prix to sell out, and thousands of the most passionate *Magic* players from all over the world, Grand Prix Chiba set a standard for what to expect from Modern Masters Weekend. The Japanese *Magic* community is a particularly passionate bunch, seen through their memorable antics, painstaking time spent on customization to make *Magic* their own, and attention to detail.



We've visited some of the finest photos to be captured over the course of the three days. These shots all showcase the passion, love, and excitement that the Japanese community—as well as the visiting travelers who came in from nearby countries or far-off continents—exhibited during Modern Masters Weekend.

The Japanese take their dedication to the costume craft very seriously.

It shows. The cosplay here this weekend featured some truly inspirational designs.

The Grand Prix wasn't simply all about the main event. Newcomers and Pro Tour finalists took part in some fun alternative events. Sushi draft, anybody?

The 3,551 player main event ultimate became 8 as Sunday evening paved way for the Top 8 draft…

…where Yuki Matsumoto, who started playing *Magic* with *Scars of Mirrodin*, took home the trophy. Congratulations to Matsumoto on being crowned Grand Prix Chiba's Modern master.

However, perhaps even more memorable than a sushi draft, or the Top 8…

…Grand Prix Chiba, and Modern Masters Weekend, will hold some very special memories for a few.
