### Wu Kingdom


Like the kingdom for which it's named, Wu Kingdom is a subtle yet sometimes fierce deck. With it, your goal is to control the playing field.


The deck features seven creatures with horsemanship, more than any of the other Portal Three Kingdoms preconstructed decks. Because they can't be blocked by creatures without horsemanship, these creatures will be the way you finish off your opponent.


The second way Wu Kingdom gains control is through counterspells. This deck features six sorceries that can counter one of your opponent's spells.


This deck also contains the Legend Creatures Lu Xun, Scholar General and Sun Quan, Lord of Wu.

### Wei Kingdom


The path to victory with Wei Kingdom is the path of disruption.


The deck features six cards dedicated to destroying your opponent's creatures.


The second way Wei Kingdom disrupts your opponent's game is through card denial. In the early part of the game, removing cards from your opponent's hand can prove vital to victory.


This deck also features the Legendary Creatures Cao Cao and Sima Yi, the Wei Field Marshal.
