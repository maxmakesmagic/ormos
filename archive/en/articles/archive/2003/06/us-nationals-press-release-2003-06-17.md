### WORKING THEIR “MAGIC” -- HUNDREDS COME TO SAN DIEGO DRAWN BY BIG BUCKS, BRAGGING RIGHTS AND THEIR FAVORITE GAME


***Magic: The Gathering*** **Trading Card Game National Championship To Be Held in San Diego June 26-29** 


**June 16, 2003 (Renton, WA)** – From Moscow (Indiana) to Vienna (Virginia) and from North Wales (Pennsylvania) to Windsor (Connecticut), hundreds of players of the world’s premiere trading card game will converge on San Diego June 26-29 for the *Magic: The Gathering* National Championship. In heated competition, die-hard *Magic* players will vie for $100,000\* in scholarship monies and $70,000 \*in cold, hard cash, as well as bragging rights and the opportunity to represent the U.S. at the *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship in Berlin (Germany) this August.


### San Diego’s Prodigal Player


San Diego's leading professional Magic player, David Humpherys, 31, is expected to be a top contender at the *Magic* U.S. National Championship. "I'm hoping to claim a big prize and represent the U.S. team at the World Championship with a strong performance on my home turf at the Nationals," said Humpherys, who has amassed more than $120,000 playing in *Magic* tournaments over the past nine years.


### Top-Ranked Players From Across the U.S. –Ages 11-37


San Diego’s Humpherys is one of the nearly 300 Magic players of all ages (ranging from 11 to 37) who have been invited to the National Championship based on their all-star performances in tournaments held across the country over the past year. The highly-anticipated *Magic: The Gathering* National Championship will be held in San Diego (at the San Diego Convention Center) for the first time in the game’s 10-year history.


“The *Magic: The Gathering* trading card game created a whole new genre of games when it debuted a decade ago,” commented Wizards of the Coast Chief Executive Officer Chuck Huebner. “In this, its tenth anniversary year, *Magic* continues to set the standard for trading card games, with the best game play and the most exciting schedule of events for players to participate in. We’re thrilled to be in San Diego for the Nationals.”


### Going Pro: Of Big Bucks, Bragging Rights and Wild Cards


*The Magic: The Gathering* National Championshipwill award a total of $70,000\* cash to tournament winners. Competition should be fierce, as the elite players, deemed “pros,” have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars simply by playing their favorite game.


Adding a wild-card element to the National Championship, a US Nationals Open event will be held the day before the tournament where additional players will contend for 20 last-minute invitations to compete in the Championship – and the chance to be among the top three who will go on to represent the United States at the World Championships taking place in Berlin, Germany this August.


### The Next Hometown Favorites?


In addition to the pro competition, younger *Magic* players (ages 15 & under) will try their hands at the *Junior Super Series* National Championship’s, which will award $100,000 \* in college scholarships, with the winner receiving a $20,000 college scholarship. San Diego boasts four top Juniors competitors, including: Ross Bernet, 15; Eric Heumann, 14; Mike Linn, 15; and Francis Roberts, 15.



### The National Championship Schedule


The *Magic: The Gathering* US Nationalstakes place June 26-29, at the San Diego Convention Center. The following events will be featured:


* **June 26 – all day - US Nationals Open (open tournaments to give 20 invitations to National Championship)**
* **June 27 – all day – *Junior Super Series* Open**
