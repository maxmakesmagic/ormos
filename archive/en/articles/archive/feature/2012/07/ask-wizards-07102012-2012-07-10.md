**Q:** What's your favorite combo out of ***Magic** 2013*?


-George


**A:** From **Trick Jarrett**, Editor-in-Chief DailyMTG.com


I immediately latched onto [Worldfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldfire) as something I'd love to play. So I am going to build a commander deck which will hopefully one day allow me to live the dream of playing [Near-Death Experience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Near-Death+Experience), a Rise of the Eldrazi enchantment which says that during my upkeep if I have exactly one life, I win the game. I would then [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) my [Near-Death Experience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Near-Death+Experience), thus exiling it. Then I would cast [Worldfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldfire). [Worldfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldfire) exiles all permanents (including my [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), thus causing [Near-Death Experience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Near-Death+Experience) to return to play). [Worldfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldfire) exiles all cards from hands and graveyards and sets everyone's life total to one. Then when the turn comes around to me again, I'll win in my upkeep thanks to the returned [Near-Death Experience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Near-Death+Experience).


It's a long shot, but we all have to dream big. There are plenty of other fun ideas around [Worldfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldfire) wins, but the [Near-Death Experience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Near-Death+Experience) is my favorite.


As for the Commander of this deck, no Red-White commanders really fit that theme, so I'll probably go with [Basandra, Battle Seraph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basandra%2C+Battle+Seraph).
