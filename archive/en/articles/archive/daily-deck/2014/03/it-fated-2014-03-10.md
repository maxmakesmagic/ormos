It is Fated!
============



 Posted in **Daily Deck**
 on March 11, 2014 










It's Fated Week here at DailyMTG.com, so let's look at [the Fated cycle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;sort=cn+amp;name=+%5Bfated%5D) from *Born of the Gods*! Trick took [a close-up look at one](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1419) already, but since Mark Rosewater wrote this week about [the history behind the cycle's design](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/290), today we're going to show off all five art pieces.

There's a good chance we'll see these cards talked about again later this week. And now, when that happens, you'll be able to reference the full art pieces here.
