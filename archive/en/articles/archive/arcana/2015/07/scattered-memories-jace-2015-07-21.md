 Yichao is a writer of words for plays, television, theme parks, and—most recently—Magic: The Gathering. He loves Cube Draft and corgis. 





Jace was one of the first Planeswalker cards introduced in *Magic*. He has featured prominently in many of the notable stories of *Magic's* Multiverse, and also has featured prominently in many notable pieces of *Magic* art. With *Origins*, we learn even more about Jace's past and his home plane.



Check out some of our favorite snapshots and memories of Jace through the years below!

This iconic card from *Magic*'s history got a Jace-over in the *Jace vs Chandra* Duel Decks. Its flavor text also didn't do anything to help Jace seem like less of an arrogant memory-stealing poopy head.

This beautiful piece features Jace at an abstracted crossroads, and features a rare quote that actually is a bit humble. (Sorta. Almost.)

Jace isn't just a telepath. Here we see Jace showcasing his mastery of illusion magic.

Jace has been to many planes in the Multiverse, including Zendikar—where, apparently, he has confronted Eldrazi spawn.

Can't get enough of Jace? Curious what he was up to before he became the Living Guildpact and Mind Sculptor we love today? Jace is featured prominently on many great new cards in *Magic Origins*, available now!
