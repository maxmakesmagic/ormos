INNISTRAD

The humans of this world have always relied on their faith to shield them from the horrors of their plane: vampires, werewolves, spirits, and ghouls. But then their archangel, Avacyn, went missing…


No longer held back by Avacyn's magic, supernatural predators increasingly preyed on this world's humans. Aristocratic vampires hunted peasant blood for sport. Snarling werewolf packs ravaged caravans and villages. Unhallowed dead fed their relentless hunger, roused by forbidden magics and brainsick alchemists.


Perilously close to their own eradication, Innistrad's humans continued to fight back against the forces of the night, relying on each other to survive their plane's horrors. Despite overwhelming evil, they never gave up hope, always praying that salvation would come.


Armed with knowledge of their foes' vulnerabilities and the residual strength in their faith, fiend hunters ventured into the haunted places of the world. Priests trained to face the unholy. Specialized slayers protected parishes across the countryside.


Just as humanity's darkest hour beckoned, Avacyn broke free of her Helvault prison, instantly revitalizing wards and blessings across the four provinces and beyond. The gryffs and angels returned, their despair dispelled by her presence. The renewed cathar army began driving vampires and zombies from the human villages by the hordes.


Avacyn also offered repentant lycanthrope-afflicted humans a special place at her side. If they promised to serve as guardians of humanity, she would transform their curse, fusing their two warring aspects into a single noble creature. Many accepted her offer, becoming the wolfir.


The restoration of balance has begun, but across the plane, evils banished for centuries are newly freed as well.
