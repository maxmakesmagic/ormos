If you were at the **Magic** panel at San Diego Comic Con this weekend, you already know this. But if you weren't, you may be interested to know that **Magic**'s February 2013 set, code-named "Line," is called *Gatecrash*.

 Â 

 With all the traditional stuff out of the way, let's run through some of the additional details that were revealed in San Diego. First of all, you might notice that it's a 249-card set. So that means it gets drafted by itself. It also means that unlike the original *Ravnica: City of Guilds* block, in which the guilds were distributed 4-3-3, the guilds could be done this way:


* *Return to Ravnica*: Five guilds
* *Gatecrash*: The other five guilds
* "Sinker": All ten guilds

And here's which guilds will be in which set!
