The Pro Tour Qualifier Honolulu season has just about come to a close, and boy do we have the deck lists to prove it! The Top 8s keep pouring in from all over the world, and the tech couldn't be hotter. Find out what the final top decks were. See what pros such as Patrick Chapin played to earn their ticket to tropical Hawaii and the chance to battle for thousands in Pro Tour prize money!


Of course, there's plenty of **Magic** going on all over! For those curious as to what the pros will be playing in Hawaii, you'll want to make sure to check out the *Shards of Alara* Block decks from **Magic Online**. That's the Constructed format for the fast approaching Pro Tour-Honolulu, with a few rounds of draft thrown in for good measure. Of course, if you're preparing for [Regionals](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/regionals), Nationals, or [Pro Tour Qualifier-Austin season](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/austin09-qualifiers), you'll want to make sure to check out the latest in Standard tech!


All that, and [*Alara Reborn* is just around the corner](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts). It's a good time to be a **Magic** player!
