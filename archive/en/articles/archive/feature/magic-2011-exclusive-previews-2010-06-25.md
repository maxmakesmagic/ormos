Previews for the ***Magic** 2011* core set are in full swing! You can already find lots of cards, both new and reprinted, in the [Visual Spoiler](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2011/spoiler) on the [M11 mini-site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/magic2011).

What's that you say? You're hungry for more? Well, good news! Tonight there's a plethora of cool new cards popping up all over the **Magic** web, and we're here to point you toward some of them.

The previews in question will go live right ... about ... *now*, as you read this, so linking to them is a long way from an exact science. With that caveat, here are the card names of the exclusive previews that should be going up tonight. We can't tell you what they do yet—that would be what "exclusive" means!—but you can follow the links below to find out. Oh, and for some of these it might help to speak French. And German. And Japanese. Good luck!
