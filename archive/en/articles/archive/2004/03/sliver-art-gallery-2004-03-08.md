In the past we've featured a lot of *Legions* Slivers on [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:):


* [Quick Sliver](/en/articles/archive/sketches-quick-sliver-2003-01-22)
* [Magma Sliver](/en/articles/archive/sketches-magma-sliver-2003-03-12)
* [Synapse Sliver](/en/articles/archive/sketches-synapse-sliver-2003-08-05)
* [Shifting Sliver](/en/articles/archive/sketches-shifting-sliver-2003-08-19)

So in lieu of doing a focused look at one more Sliver, we're just going to get to the good bits for Sliver Week: art, art, art.


Today we focus on the cycle of five multicolored Slivers from *Stronghold*. Enjoy.
