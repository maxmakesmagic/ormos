### Wes Hovanec


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** New York  
**Occupation:** Phyrexian Sympathizer/Electric Bongo Player


 

**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Grand Prix Philadelphia 2008 side draft semifinalist


**What deck did you choose to play this weekend, and why did you play it?**  

BUG Infect. Swept a PTQ with it 18 months ago. It's still the best deck.


**What card has been your MVP this weekend and why?**  

Gitaxian Probe. You get to run 56 cards in your combo deck and know when to safely go all in.


**What was your best matchup so far this weekend? What was your worst? What happened?**  

Best: Anything except Junk. Worst: Junk.


**What was the hardest part of making the Top 8 for you this weekend?**  

The Magic wasn't very difficult. Convincing my friends the deck is good was impossible. Collective represent.

### Pierre Dagen


**Age:** 26  
**Hometown:** Paris  
**Occupation:** Healthcare Consultant


 

**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

2nd at Pro Tour Theros. Top 8 Grand Prix Bochum 2012. Meeting Timothee Simonot.


**What deck did you choose to play this weekend, and why did you play it?**  

Junk, because it lets you play a fair game against unfair decks, except all your cards are better.


**What card has been your MVP this weekend and why?**  

Darkblast. I drew it twice, only when it was game-winning against Pod and Ravager. It also synergizes so well with the deck.


**What was your best matchup so far this weekend? What was your worst? What happened?**  

Best: Ad Nauseam. Egg vs. Wall. Worst: Living End. I never got crushed so hard by a guy so good.


**What was the hardest part of making the Top 8 for you this weekend?**  

Seeing Timothee lose his win-and-in with the same deck.

### Andrew Boswell


**Age:** 30  
**Hometown:** Sugar Loaf, NY  
**Occupation:** Ceramic Artist


 

**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Born down the street from Reid and Ian Duke.


**What deck did you choose to play this weekend, and why did you play it?**  

I chose Jund because it is a great deck, fits my play style, and I have the most experience with it.


**What card has been your MVP this weekend and why?**  

Liliana of the Veil. It is a great card in almost every match-up.


**What was your best matchup so far this weekend? What was your worst? What happened?**  

My best match-up was against Samuele Estratti when he drew mono-lands. My worst was against him when he Mind Slavered me and ultimated my Liliana.


**What was the hardest part of making the Top 8 for you this weekend?**  

Sleep, nutrition and hydration.

Mono-Blue Control featuring Blood Moon.


**What card has been your MVP this weekend and why?**  

Serum Visions. Helped out not screwing or flooding all day.


**What was your best matchup so far this weekend? What was your worst? What happened?**  

Best: Scapeshift. Better late game and Blood Moon makes it tough. Worst was Choke, support cards didn't really matter.


**What was the hardest part of making the Top 8 for you this weekend?**  

Being on the draw all but one match with a Remand control deck. Also, staying focused: Thanks, jet lag!

**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Two Grand Prix Top 8s. One Pro Tour Top 25.

Junk Midrange. It's well-positioned against other G/B Midrange decks that don't run Lingering Souls, and has a great sideboard plan against most decks.


**What card has been your MVP this weekend and why?**  

Lingering Souls. It's really good in the mirror and against Affinity.


**What was your best matchup so far this weekend? What was your worst? What happened?**  

Best match-up: Twin. Worst match-up: Tron, which I won. My Tron opponent mulliganed a lot.


**What was the hardest part of making the Top 8 for you this weekend?**  

Getting the cards. I forgot my Modern cards at home and had to borrow the whole deck. I almost played Pod.
