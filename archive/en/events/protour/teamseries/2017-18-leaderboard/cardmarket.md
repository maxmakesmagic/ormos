Cardmarket
==========





















Overview
--------


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/events/teamseries/Cardmarket_Team.jpg)


Six of Europe's Grand Prix regulars—headlined by Slovenia's Robin Dolar—have joined together as team Cardmarket. The six members have varying experience across their roster, but a fairly solid amount of experience at the Grand Prix level that they aim to leverage on *Magic*'s big stage.


**2017-18 Team Standings**


*Note: An italicized team member score is not included in the team's total by event. Only the Top 5 team member results are counted, with the exception of the last Pro Tour of the season.  

An asterisk (\*) next to a player's name means that the player has been substituted off the team in favor of a different player.*   
*Any Pro Tour Pro Point totals in the below standings marked with a hyphen mean that the player's Pro Points did not count for the team's score as of that Pro Tour.*
