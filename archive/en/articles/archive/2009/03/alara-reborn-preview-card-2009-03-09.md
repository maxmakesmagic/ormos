So we said "let's do an *Alara Reborn* preview card!" And the powdered wigs up in their ivory tower said "What?! I should say not! It's far too early for that sort of thing, what what!"

And then they reaffixed their monocles and straightened their silk ascots.

But we persisted! And finally, a deal was struck. We'd get to run a preview card, but we'd have to erase all the rules text. Oh well. We're sure that if you study this card assiduously, you'll find *something* interesting to speculate about!
