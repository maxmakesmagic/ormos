Grand Prix tournament byes can be earned either through a player's yearly [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/Information) total or by winning a [Grand Prix Trial](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-trials-event-types-events).


Byes earned through Planeswalker Points are calculated using the Planeswalker Point totals from all reported events as of the Tuesday immediately before the Grand Prix. Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix.


Winners of a Grand Prix Trial tournament are awarded two byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds.
