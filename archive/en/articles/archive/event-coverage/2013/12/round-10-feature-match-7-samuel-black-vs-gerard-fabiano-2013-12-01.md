Both No. 7 Ranked Player Samuel Black and Gerard Fabiano were coming into Day Two in good shape. Both players had 8-1 records and both had decks that were full of powerful cards. While Fabiano was looking for a fast start with his aggressive white-red deck, Black had a number of powerful blue and green cards, including some blue disruption and some massive creatures like [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp).


Who would continue on with only a single loss?


### The Games


Black was first to act with [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad). "How have you not played anything yet?" he asked Fabiano, who sat with an untapped Plains and Mountain. Fabiano obliged him with a hasty [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) on the third turn, which promptly traded with the Dryad when Black blocked. [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) stopped [Purphoros's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%27s+Emissary) in its tracks on the next turn, and Black fired back with [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) and [Ordeal of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea) on the flying creature.

*No. 7 Ranked Player Samuel Black*

Fabiano did not have removal for the [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin), but he did have [Ray of Dissolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Dissolution) to take out the Ordeal. Black pressed on by attacking with his [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) before adding [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) to the board. Fabiano, however, was stuck with a load of combat tricks in hand but no creatures with which to cast, a [Borderland Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Minotaur) stranded in his hand due to lacking the necessary second Mountain to cast it. Black continued to improve his board with [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple).


He finally found a creature he could cast, [Spearpoint Oread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearpoint+Oread), and [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) stopped Black's Fade Into Antiquity before his [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) attacked in. When Fabiano added [Leonin Snarecaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster) to his board and passed with mana up and creatures untapped, Black just sent in his [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) and [Nylea's Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple), losing the latter creature to a mid-combat [Coordinated Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coordinated+Assault). Black cast a post-combat [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar), then passed back to Fabiano, who had two more [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing)s, a [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), and the stranded [Borderland Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Minotaur) in his hand.


Attacks dropped Fabiano to 6 after he blocked the [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) and used [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) to save his creature, but Black had another behemoth in Volpine Goliath. While Fabiano now had a window to take out [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) with [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), he was dead in the air on the next turn.


The second game started out a lot better for Fabiano, who had a second-turn [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader), and was met with no resistance when he cast [Ordeal of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros) on it during the next turn, dropping Black to 17 between the token and the now 2/2 red creature. [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser) came down and blocked the 1/1 token on the next turn, meeting its fate to [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) before Black fell to 14. This signaled [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) on the [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader) which Black immediately cast when he untapped, a play that stranded Fabiano on drawing any lands the next turn. He simply re-cast his one mana creature as he sputtered on a Mountain and Plains, and was met with a huge wall in the form of [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp).

*Gerard Fabiano*

[Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) on upkeep at Black found Fabiano no lands, and Black had his own upkeep spell with [Horizon Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Chimera) before the Asp attacked in. Another Magmet Jet on upkeep disposed of the Chimera, but again Fabiano did not find the Plains he was looking for to enable his [Phalanx Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) and [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) to be cast. Meanwhile, Black continued playing monsters with [Horizon Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Scholar).


Fabiano cast [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) sent in his team, and Black blocked the [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader), falling to 7. However, Black's board proved to be insurmountable, and he conceded on the next turn.


Black 2 – Fabiano 0


"I just needed him to not have [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide)," Fabiano said after the match. His hand was powerful, but the [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) ensured that his first plan would not only sputter, but it also denied him the double white he needed to cast his grip of powerful white creatures.
