With 2460 players battling in Worcester this weekend, it is difficult to keep track of all those that are doing well. This round I caught up with some of the top tables


**Jared Boettcher vs Carl Godon**:


After mulliganing down to five cards in Game 1, presumptive Rookie of the Year Jared Boettcher and his Kiki-Pod deck couldn't gain couldn't gain any traction against Carl Godon's U/B control deck with its countermagic and removal spells. He died in short order to a [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), as Godon held back a [Dreadship Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadship+Reef) with many a storage counter piled upon it to ensure he always had access to a healthy amount of blue or black mana.


Boettcher set out developing his board in Game 2 with a pair of [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch)s. Once Godon had five lands in play he attempted to wipe away most of the Pod player's creatures with [Consume the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek), but a timely [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) kept the board in its current state. With the coast clear, Boettcher went off. He activated [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) to fetch a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), untapping the Pod, which went right back into action. He sacrificed a [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) to retrieve [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker), which, when combined with the Exarch, made a whole bunch of hasty Clerics to swing in for lethal.

In Game 3, Boettcher managed to resolve a [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) and tried to follow it up with an [Archangel of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune) to threaten another combo kill. But Godon was holding [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to counter the Archangel and bounce the Pod. Godon set to work attacking with [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) once again. An [Avalanche Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) off the top killing the unblockable land bought Boettcher some time, but not enough, and Godon went on to take the match in three games.



**Godon 2 - 1 Boettcher**


**Pierre Dagen vs Nicholas Heal**:


At table 714 Pierre Dagen, the runner-up at last year's Pro Tour *Theros*, faced down Nicholas Heal, packing Mono-Red Burn. In both games an early [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) provided a painless way for Dagen to chisel away at Heal's reservoir of burn spells, and in both games Dagen followed the discard spell with a good-sized [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). A combination of [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) and [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)s piled on to help end the games quickly, and Dagen walked away victorious, relieved to have won a match-up that he said could be problematic for his midrange Junk deck.

**Sebastian Villenueve vs Marc Tobiasch**:


After winning Game 1, Sebastian Villenueve set about filling his graveyard with creatures as quickly as possible, cycling [Street Wraith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith)s and [Deadshot Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadshot+Minotaur)s and sculpting his hand. When his opponent, Marc Tobiasch, decided to cast a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) on Villeneuve's end step, the [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) player decided to go for it.


With four untapped lands, he cast the 3-mana Violent Burst to cascade into [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End). Tobiasch had two untapped lands himself and cast [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), seeking to return the suspend spell to Villeneuve's hand. But it was a trap. Since Tobiasch had cast a blue spell this turn—two in fact—Villeneuve was able to pay 1 mana for [Ricochet Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ricochet+Trap), enabling his [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) to resolve. He exiled a [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide) to cycle one last card for good measure, and returned seven beefy creatures to the battlefield, winning Game 2 and the match in short order.

**Guillaum Wafo-Tapa vs Alexander Neufeldt**:


At table 716 Guillaume Wafo-Tapa was up against Alexander Neufeldt's U/R Tempo Twin. Fresh off a 21st place finish at Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*, well-known control specialist Wafo-Tapa shocked nobody by registering Esper here in Worcester. After Neufeldt won a long Game 1, the players turned to their sideboards and settled in for what would prove to be an even longer Game 2.


An early [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Wafo-Tapa removed a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) from Neufeldt's hand, leaving a [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles), [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and some lands. From there the blue decks did what blue decks do: hit land drops and hold up mana on their opponent's turn.


With seven lands in play, Wafo-Tapa opted to cast [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for four on his opponent's upkeep. The good news for Wafo-Tapa was that the powerful X spell resolved, netting him four cards and four life. The bad news was that this enabled Neufeldt to resolve [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), leaving Wafo-Tapa with just non-Mountain lands: a basic Island and another Island courtesy of [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas).


Choked on mana, Wafo-Tapa managed to draw another basic Island. This enabled him to cast, and resolve, [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), bouncing the [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) and setting free his many [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade)s and [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave)s. A subsequent [Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm) forced Neufeldt to discard his final two cards in hand, including the [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon)—at instant speed, no less.


Wafo-Tapa seemed to have pulled ahead. A [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for nine on Neufeldt's upkeep seemed to confirm this. Tapping out for Revelation allowed Neufeldt to resolve a [Keranos, God of Storms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos%2C+God+of+Storms), but Wafo-Tapa had abundant answers at the ready, including a [Celestial Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge). Elspeth Knight-Errant hit the board for Wafo-Tapa and Neufeldt, scooped soon thereafter.

With just two minutes left in the round the players hurried through sideboarding and sped through their first few turns, anxious to avoid a draw. On the third turn of extra time, Neufeldt dug furiously for a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) or [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), hoping for a last-ditch combo win. A [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) found an Exarch, but with only three untapped lands he had no way to answer Wafo-Tapa's [Logic Knot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic+Knot) and the match ended in a draw.
