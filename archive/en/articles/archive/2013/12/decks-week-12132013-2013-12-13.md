Despite an unusual and epic blizzard that shut down Dallas/Fort Worth's airports, roughly 800 players made it to [Grand Prix Dallas/Fort Worth](/en/events/coverage/gutierrez-seizes-victory-fort-worth) last weekend. The blizzard wasn't the only gauntlet, though, as the Top 8 contained **two** Hall of Famers! Despite those challenges, Marlon Gutierrez of Mexico City battled his way to victory. Congratulations Marlon! One way to join Marlon at *Journey into Nyx* in May is to win a PTQ. Find one near you with [this handy link](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/qualifierlist#jou)! Good luck; have fun!
