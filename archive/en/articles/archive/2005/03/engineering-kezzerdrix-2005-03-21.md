From the depths of the **Magic: The Gathering** marketing archives comes another classic **Magic** TV commercial! Last December we showed you [Orgg vs. Bob from Accounting](/en/articles/archive/orgg-vs-bob-accounting-2004-12-02); today we revisit another one.


You might have seen this spot that showcases the very special design process that led to the [Kezzerdrix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kezzerdrix) (7.2 MB Zipped MOV). Enjoy.
