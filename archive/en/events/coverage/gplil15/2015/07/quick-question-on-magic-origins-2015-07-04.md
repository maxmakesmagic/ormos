 We talked to some of the bigger names in the venue today, and asked them about their thoughts on Magic Origins, the upcoming set the full contents of which had officially been [revealed yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/magicorigins). Specifically, we wanted to know: What card in *Magic Origins* do you think will have the most impact?

**Platinum pro Martin Jůza:** "I haven't seen the full spoiler yet. But the spell for 1G that looks at the top five cards and puts a creature into hand, or two with spell mastery [[Gather the Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+the+Pack)]—I saw that one and thought it might go into [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) decks."
