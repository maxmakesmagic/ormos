We are once again honored to continue our partnership with Extra Life for another year. Thanks to your kindness, we've been able to donate over $3,700,000 since 2015. Who knows how high we'll reach this year! We're donating 50% of each *Extra Life 2021* purchase directly to Extra Life.


These adorable cards will be available to preorder on [secretlair.wizards.com](https://secretlair.wizards.com/us) beginning 9 a.m. PT November 5 through 9 a.m. PT November 8.


What Is Extra Life?
===================


Formed in 2008, Extra Life is an annual fundraising event where people from all sorts of gaming spaces come together to support Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. 100% of Wizards's donations go directly to supporting the Autism Center at Seattle Children's Hospital, one way to give to those in need through the community you love.


What's in the Drop?
===================


We wrangled a group of extremely talented children and asked them to draw us their take on iconic *Magic* creatures, like [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) and [Craterhoof Behemoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth). We took those young Picassos' masterpieces and handed them over to all-star artists Lars Grant-West, Chris Rahn, and Magali Villeneuve to bring those drawings further to life. You get two copies of each card in the drop—one with the kid's art, and the other with the professional artist's interpretation. We're not gonna lie, it's super cute. The flavor text comes from conversations with the kids, too! So, do some good and get multiple copies of some awesome cards. Support Extra Life today!
