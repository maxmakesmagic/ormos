![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsyd03/a982.jpg)Fujita won the toss and elected to play, mulliganing away his first hand. Happy with his next 6, and with Haddy content to play, we began.

### Game One

Haddy opened with 2 [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar)s, with Fujita beginning with a [Slith Ascendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Ascendant).

It got no bigger how ever as Haddy was able to muster the [Wizard Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) to hold the fort. A [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol) followed by an [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger), gave Fujita an excellent 6-card start. 6 lands in six turns is perhaps not what you would ideally be after when playing into a mulligan. Playing a [Yotian Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) saw no cards left in Fujita's hand. 

Haddy spread his equipment over his newly cast [Goblin War Wagon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon) as he sat back in cruise control. Fujita pressed for 7 with a top decked [Detonate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate) on the [Wizard Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica), dropping Haddy down to 6.

With nothing more from the top of his deck, Haddy moved to the second Game #2.

### Game Two

With both players happy with their opening hand Haddy opened with one of his [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar)s, but the tempo was dominated by Fujita, with repeated his great game #1 start of third turn Slith and a 4th turn [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol). Haddy had no play by turn 5, with his first defense being in the form of a [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel) - copying Fujita's [Dragon Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Blood). A [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) then destroyed Fujita original, but the clock was ticking with Haddy down to a meager 10. 

Haddy then kindly offered commentary on the remainder of the match " It should read Haddy draws more land as Fujita continues to beat on him savagely".

Even with a second [Dragon Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Blood) on the table, Haddy had no answer for the now 4/4 Slith. Outstretching the hand in congratulations.

Fujita 2 - Haddy - 0
