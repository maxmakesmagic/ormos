Explanation of Changes
======================



Wizards of the Coast examines tournament results from each competitive Constructed format. In the case of Pauper, we use data from every *Magic Online* tournament. A few months ago, decks using [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) were doing well, but there were enough other competitive decks to make a healthy metagame.



Over the past few months, the [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) decks have become more efficient, and the Pauper metagame has become significantly less diverse. In the interest of bringing back that healthy metagame, Wizards of the Coast has decided to make a change. While other cards in decks that play [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) are played in many other decks, the goal is to make a healthy metagame, not just identify the single most played card (even excluding Island). Instead, we look for the card most strongly identified with the change in the metagame and the loss of diversity. That card, [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), is now banned.


The banned list for 100 Card Singleton is primarily based off the Vintage banned list. However, creatures play a much different role in 100 Card Singleton than they do in Vintage. In this format, [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) gives too much card drawing with too little effort. [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) is banned in 100 Card Singleton.
