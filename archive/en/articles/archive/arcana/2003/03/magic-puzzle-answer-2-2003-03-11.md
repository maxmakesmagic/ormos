![Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cruel+Revival)Many people figured out last week's [**Magic** puzzle](/en/articles/archive/magic-puzzle-2003-03-07) the way we had anticipated, using [Infest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest) to eventually clear the board. But Arjan Schuurmans found out a way to deal a whopping 20 damage to Carrot Top, using the [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) instead of the [Infest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest).


Follow along…


1. During Carrot Top's end of turn step, tap all your lands for mana. Use [Smokespew Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokespew+Invoker)'s ability to give Carrot Top's [Wretched Anurid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) -3/-3. It's destroyed.
2. Still during Carrot Top's end of turn step, tap any five of your Zombies to activate [Gravespawn Sovereign](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravespawn+Sovereign), putting Carrot Top's [Wretched Anurid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) into play under you control.
3. Untap at the start of your turn.
4. During your upkeep, sacrifice [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) to the [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), which is now 4/4. Give [Prowling Pangolin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowling+Pangolin) –1/-1, making it 5/4.
5. Still during your upkeep, tap [Aphetto Vulture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Vulture), [Smokespew Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokespew+Invoker), [Gravespawn Sovereign](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravespawn+Sovereign), [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul), and [Wretched Anurid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) to activate the Sovereign's ability. Target [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin).
6. With this ability on the stack, sac [Wretched Anurid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) to the Husk, which is now 6/6. (Very tricky!)
7. [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) comes into play. [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul) gives all of Carrot Top's creatures –1/-1.
8. Still during your upkeep, sac the Goblin to the Husk (8/8). Give the Pangolin -1/-1; it is now 3/2.
9. Still during your upkeep, sac the Vulture to the Husk (10/10). Put [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) on top of your library.
10. Draw your card ([Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin)).
11. During you first main phase, tap a Swamp and play the Goblin. [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul) give all of Carrot Top's creatures another –1/-1.
12. Sac the Goblin to the Husk (12/12). Give the [Treespring Lorian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treespring+Lorian) -1/-1; it is now 2/1.
13. Tap five more Swamps, play [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) targeting [Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler) and [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin). The Crawler dies, and you get your Goblin back in your hand.
14. Tap a Swamp and play the Goblin. [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul) give all of Carrot Top's creatures another –1/-1, killing all of them except the [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna), which is 0/1.
15. Sac Goblin to the Husk (14/14). Give the [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna) -1/-1; it dies.
16. Sac your remaining three Zombies (Invoker, Ghoul, and Sovereign) to the Husk, which is now 20/20.
17. Attack for 20 damage.

Congratulations to Arjan and anyone else who found this even better answer!
