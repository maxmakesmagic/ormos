 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






Just over four years ago (on March 11, 2002), I wrote one of my first columns entitled “[Timmy, Johnny, and Spike](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2002-03-11)”. That column has the distinction of being the most visited column in the history of **magicthegathering.com**. In it I talk about a fundamental tool R&D uses in design and development. But before I start talking about that, I have to start this article, as I did the one back then, with a test. Ever since I wrote the first article, I've been deluged with requests to update the test as it referenced cards from the *Odyssey* block that a lot of players are unfamiliar with. So without any further ado, here is the Timmy, Johnny, Spike test updated for *Ravnica* block. (If you have no idea what these terms mean, I promise to cover it in detail after the test.)

So please test the test and then we'll talk. Don't worry. It's quite painless.

See you after the test.
