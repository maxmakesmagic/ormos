"Due to a database error, everyone in the tournament is listed as being English. We apologize, but this was the only way we could think of how to make sure we have an English winner."


– Head judge announcement Saturday morning

"How's your deck?"


"It has a pretty good late game."


"Well … every deck in this format has a pretty good late game."


"I sure hope they do because I have two copies of [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)! And if they don't have a good late game, I don't have a good late game."

 "'Did someone call for a [naked butler](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpliv15/dutch-dinos-tour-2015-03-07)?'"

"Anafenza, the Foremost on turn three, [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) on four, and Armamanet Corps on five …? Gee, if you added one [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) on turn two, that'd be an insane opening in Constructed even!"


– Frank Karsten, after losing to Thomas Enevoldsen's turn-three Anafenza, turn-four [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), turn-five [Armament Corps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armament+Corps) …

"All was going well … until I tried to cast [Cached Defenses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cached+Defenses) mid-combat."


– Nicolai Herzog
