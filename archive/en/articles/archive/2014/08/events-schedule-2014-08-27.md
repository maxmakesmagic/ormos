As a general rule, Magic Online sets will be available for redemption roughly one month after they are released. If a redeemable set runs out of stock before its Redemption Guarantee Date, the set will be reprinted. After a redeemable set's Redemption Guaranteed Date has passed, such set will be available while supplies last or until its Cutoff Date, whichever comes first. All Redemption Guarantee and Cutoff dates include a cutoff time of 9:00 AM Pacific.


For additional information about redemption, please read our [Redemption Policy](/content/productmtgoredemptionpolicies).
