### Entry Fee


The entry fee for all Grand Prix—Kobe Trial tournaments in Japan is ¥1,000. (The entry fee was previously incorrectly announced as ¥2,000.)


### Format


 

* The format for all Grand Prix—Kobe Trial tournaments is Lorwyn-Shadowmoor Block Constructed. For information on this format, please refer to the DCI™ Universal Tournament Rule and Magic Floor Rules documents on the [DCI Document Center](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home).
* The *Eventide*™ expansion is not legal for use in the Standard format until July 25, 2008.Trial tournaments held prior to this date will **not** use the *Eventide*™ expansion.
* Deck lists are required.

### Tournament Structure


 

* The structure for all non-retail Grand Prix—Kobe Trial tournaments will be modified Swiss-style, with the Top 8 players playing in a single-elimination round for prizes and invitations. (In the event a Grand Prix–Kobe Trial tournament has 16 or fewer players, the Top 4 players will advance to the single-elimination round.) Retail Trial tournaments will be run using normal Swiss-style, with no Top 8 elimination round.
* Each round in the Swiss portion of the tournament will be 50 minutes.
* The number of Swiss rounds will be determined based on attendance according to the following chart:
 

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attendance** | **No. of Rounds****(non-retail)** | **No. of Rounds****(retail)** |
| 8 – 16 | 4 | 5 |
| 17 - 32 | 5 | 6 |
| 33 – 64 | 6 | 7 |
| 65 – 128 | 7 | 8 |
| 129 – 226 | 8 | 9 |
| 227 – 410 | 9 | 10 |
| 411 or higher | 10 | 11 |

### Advancement


 

* All players may participate in all Swiss rounds.
* The top 8 players after the final Swiss round will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.

### Top 8 Finals


 

* All Top 8 matches at Grand Prix—Kobe Trial tournaments will be best 2 of 3.
* When necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings.

### Notes


 

* All Grand Prix—Kobe tournaments are run at Rules Enforcement Level: Competitive, and are 24K.
* All Universal Tournament Rules and **Magic: The Gathering** Floor Rules are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this format document.
* Players are responsible for bringing their own pen, paper, card sleeves, and appropriate counters.

### Prizes


 

* The winning player of each Grand Prix—Kobe tournament in Japan will receive an third-round bye at Grand Prix—Kobe (to be held August 2-3, 2008). If the winner of a Grand Prix—Kobe Trial already has a third-round bye, the bye does not pass down. Byes are only usable for the appropriate Grand Prix and cannot be "carried over" to another Grand Prix tournament.
* Additional product prizes may be awarded, as determined by the organizer.

### Registration Information


 

* Players who want more specific local tournament or registration information should contact their local organizer.
* Information in this document is specific to Japan; Trials held outside Japan may have different entry fees, etc. For information regarding tournaments outside Japan, please contact the local organizer.
* Trials to be held at a retail location are marked with a \* in the chart below.
