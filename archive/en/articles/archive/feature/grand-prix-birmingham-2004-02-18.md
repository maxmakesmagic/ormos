**Things to do in Birmingham**

**26th March** If you like ghost stories **A GRAVEYARD** walk is being organised. Its about a one hour walk around Warstone Lane Cemetery in Birmingham's jewellery quarter. Your guide will tour you around some of the cemetery's famous residence. The walk is a mixture of Ghost stories and local history. Book early to avoid disappointment. +44 (0) 121 202 5000

If that's not your thing there is the sea life centre, the chocolate factory, the science museum "Think Tank" and a whole host of excellent bars and restaurants and clubs all in one area just to make it really easy.

**NIGHTLIFE**

Broad Street  
 Broad Street is one of the busiest quarter miles in Europe. A lively boulevard lined with Pubs and clubs. Kick start your night at the Hard Rock cafe, Waxy O'Connors or the Sports Cafe before you "dance" the night away at Tiger Tiger or The Works

Brindley Street  
 Is just off Broad Street and offers some great continental style bars and restaurants by the canal side. It's said to be the city's hippest nightspot.

MailBox  
 A new complex offering shopping, bars and restaurants all in the one spot. Very trendy with the young'uns!

**Culture**

If you're looking for some culture did you know **Tolkein** lived in Birmingham for 16 years? Many landmarks in the city are said to have inspired his writing. For example the Sarehole Mill is said to be the Mill in the Hobbit. Perrot's Folly and the nearby Victorian Water Tower suggest Minas Morgul and Minas Tirith the two towers of Gandor; and Mosely Bog, a mysterious and fantastical woodland, described as the old forest where Tom Bombadil lived.

Nearby is **Warwick Castle**, Britains greatest mediaeval experience.  
 It was Ethelfleda, daughter of Alfred the Great, with Danish invaders threatening Mercia, the central Anglo-Saxon kingdom, who ordered the building in AD 914 of a 'burh'.   
It was another invader who was responsible for the first true castle built on the site. William the Conqueror established a motte and bailey fort here in 1068 as a means of holding the area and securing his lines of supply.  
 Experience a thousand years of history at Warwick Castle. See the mediaeval preparation for battle in 'Kingmaker' or The Armoury 'Death or Glory' attraction, telling the stories of battles over the centuries.
