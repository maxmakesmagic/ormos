 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






Thursday saw the longest day of play for the Community Team, not able to cycle though players like the Wizards team was able to do. Things started out with optimistic outlooks on the parts of both teams. Both the Community deck building squad, with Conley Woods at the helm, and their Wizards counterparts, headed by former Community representative and Community Cup winner Gavin Verhey, felt very confident with their deck choices for the RGDR Unified Constructed.


After three rounds of play, those feelings of optimism quickly soured for the Community Team. After a series of bad matchups and unfortunate events, the Community Team found themselves down by over 80 points, a seemingly insurmountable hole, even with the upcoming Multiball rounds. The Community players were surprised by their predicament, especially because of the similarities between the Wizards decks and the original versions of their own decks. Did their changes cost them wins, or were they simply victims of circumstance? Regardless of the answer, they needed help, and the Wacky Cube draft would provide it.


Designed by the guys at LoadingReadyRun (except James) and secretly developed in-house at Wizards by Ryan Spain, the Wacky Cube draft was clearly the most popular format of the event for the players, coverage staff, and viewers at home. There were twenty draft restrictions each placed on a whiteboard, and the teams would alternate drafting these restrictions until each member of both teams had a draft rule they had to follow. Examples of these rules were wrongwaygoback's hilarious Look Sharpe draft, where he and Wizards Concept Artist Richard Whitters had to draft the most well-dressed card from each pack, and Lee Sharpe's flurry of notes while drafting Un-Bear-Able, where he had to draft the card that shared the most attributes with [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears).


Despite being down immensely, the Community Team rallied, ending up with significantly stronger decks than their Wizards of the Coast counterparts. There were strong performances from Smi77y's 60-card "Constructed" Cube deck and it's massive [Genesis Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave)s and bubba0077's Quick Draw! deck, which had to draft any card that said "draw a card." Who knew card drawing was good?! When the dust settled after the first day, the Community had shaved the point lead all the way down to a manageable 40 points, down 210-170.
