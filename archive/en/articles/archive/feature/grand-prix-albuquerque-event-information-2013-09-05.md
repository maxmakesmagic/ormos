If you made it this far you're about to learn about the $30,000 prize purse, the Pro Points, and even the invitations to the Pro Tour. That stuff is all important but want to know what makes Grand Prix Albuquerque unique? Friends.


 This is a magical gathering in every sense of the word. Players you know, players you don't, Hall of Fame players and players who've never played seriously. The chance to discover or rediscover **Magic: The Gathering** and make friends who understand you. 


 This is Albuquerque's first Grand Prix and the 20-year strong **Magic** community is stoked to meet YOU. Poetic Sunsets, 700-year old petroglyphs, and the breathtaking Sandia Mountains are all honey on the sopapilla. The Albuquerque **Magic** Community, Sunmesa Events and Wizards of the Coast are going to make this Grand Prix a keeper. 


Surely Yeats had Grand Prix Albuquerque in mind when he wrote "There are no strangers here only friends we haven't met yet."

* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.

* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
