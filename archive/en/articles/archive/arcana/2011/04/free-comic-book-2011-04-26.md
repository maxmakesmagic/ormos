What do you think of when I say "May 7" to you? If you said "the *New Phyrexia* Prerelease," then you're correct! Except that's not the May 7 event we're talking about today. So an even more correct answer would be "Free Comic Book Day!"


[Free Comic Book Day](http://www.freecomicbookday.com/) is a single day—the first Saturday in May each year—when participating comic book shops across North America and around the world give away comic books absolutely **FREE**\* to anyone who comes into their stores.


\* Check with your local shop for their participation and rules.


And this year, there's a **Magic**-related comic! It looks like this:


![Free Comic Book Day Path of the Planeswalker 2 Preview](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/697_fcbd.jpg)  
This is a preview of *Path of the Planeswalker II*, which will be the second print collection of the [Planeswalker comics](/en/node/638086). It's a sequel to [Path of the Planeswalker](/en/articles/archive/path-planeswalker-2010-01-05), which is already available.
