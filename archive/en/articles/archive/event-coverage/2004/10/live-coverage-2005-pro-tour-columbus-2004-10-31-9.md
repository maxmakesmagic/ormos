Masashi Oiso comprises a big part of one of the stories of this Pro Tour. Lead by their young superstar, the Japanese dominated the top of the standings this weekend, placing three players in the Top 8 and a fourth in ninth place. Oiso has now made four final Sundays in his relatively brief career, including back-to-back Top 8s in Extended Pro Tours. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcol05/qf4_1.jpg)*Olivier Ruel, left, and Masashi Oiso*


Sitting across from Masashi is Olivier Ruel, another stellar Magician who is appearing in his third Pro Tour Sunday to go along with his nine Grand Prix Top 8s.


Looking at the matchup ahead of time, most experts were undecided as top which player would actually win this matchup. Desire is very fast when undisrupted, but Ruel's sideboard contains a lot of discard spells to go along with his Cabal Therapies in the maindeck, meaning the Goblin deck would have a chance to lay a couple of beaters and then tear apart Oiso's hand after Game 1.


"I did not test this at all last night," admitted Olivier, "so I am now learning his sideboard by heart in the thirty seconds before the match starts."


"Masashi... nice shirt," said Ruel, pointing to Oiso's Pro Tour-Columbus shirt that was passed out to all the competitors when they registered this weekend. "I so did not expect to do well in this tournament. We changed decks a couple of days before we came here. I tested everything except for Goblins and I didn't like anything. I talked to a friend and asked if Goblins were good. He said yes, so I decided to play it. Now I am here."


### Game 1


Ruel drew a hand of all red cards for his opener and was forced to toss it back, as Oiso kept his. A second hand of three lands, [Skirk Prospector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Prospector), [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver), and [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander) was deemed adequate, and they were off. [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), a turn-two [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), and [Sapphire Medallion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion) were the first three turns for Oiso, as Ruel built a somewhat slow Goblin army with [Skirk Prospector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Prospector), [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver), and [Goblin Matron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Matron), searching out [Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief). Oiso seemed disappointed when his only play on turn four was to cast an imprinted [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and pass the turn. Ruel gave a little fist pump when he drew his next card, plucking [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) off the top.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcol05/qf4_2.jpg)*Masashi Oiso*
He whiffed on the discard spell by naming [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), as Oiso revealed [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap). Ruel attacked, and with the Piledriver trigger on the stack, Oiso [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)ped a [Skirk Prospector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Prospector). Olivier sacrificed the Prospector in response, making certain Oiso wouldn't get to untap any lands from the spell. After combat, Ruel ripped the remaining card from Oiso's hand, which ended up being an [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) after Oiso cast the [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to fetch it.


Ruel cast a [Meltdown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meltdown) for zero, clearing both of Oiso's Moxes from the board, and leaving him with a measly two [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s and no hand. Masashi drew his next card and then scooped up his board, conceding there was nothing he could do to prevent his death on the next turn.


**Ruel 1, Oiso 0**


### Game 2


Ruel brought in three [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), three [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), and [Meltdown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meltdown) from his sideboard, getting rid of some of his slower goblins.


"I'm lucky, otherwise I wouldn't be here," said Ruel, as he chose to keep a one-land hand with a [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire), [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), Prospector, [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), [Goblin Ringleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ringleader), and [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver). The hand was obviously gassy, but Olivier would need to draw at least one, and probably two or three more land in order to have a chance to impede Oiso's combo.



![Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Piledriver)

Of course, Ruel turned out to be right, as he topdecked a [Sulfurous Springs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Springs) exactly when he needed it, and cast the Piledriver, which Oiso [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend)ed for one.


"He has one sideboard..." Ruel said to me, "one [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend), one [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)."


Ruel mised *another* Springs directly off the top of his deck, referring to himself as "nice player." The third land let him cast and resolve [Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief), as Oiso didn't have his second sideboarded counterspell in hand. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) from Ruel stole an [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) from Oiso, revealing [Turnabout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout), a land, and [Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night)scape Familiar, exposing his hand as very weak. [Goblin Ringleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ringleader) from Ruel gave him another Piledriver and a Matron in his hand, and Oiso was again overrun by little red beaters, in spite of a [Turnabout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout) that delayed his death for a turn.


**Ruel 2, Oiso 0**


"I didn't play very well this weekend, I keep hands I should not keep, and yet I am up 2-0 against the best player in the Top 8," Ruel sighed. "Magic... It is so important to win your first match in a Top 8. You get almost twice as much money, more Pro Tour points, and plus, even though it's not supposed to matter, if you win, you get a trophy. I don't want to go home after a PT top 8 without a trophy."


### Game 3


Ruel decided to keep his hand after his first four cards revealed two lands, [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), and [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction). The rest of his hand was [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), a third land, and [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver), giving him little real gas, but the possibility to wreck Oiso with excellent discard.


An early [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) sent [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) to the bin. Another [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) off the top got rid of [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), forcing a stern frown from Oiso, as he revealed only two more lands in hand, marking him as clearly manaflooded - a situation that was not helped by Ruel's hand destruction. Ruel cast [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) imprinting his [Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extract)ion, and then cast a Ringleader, getting two more Ringleaders and a [Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief) for his troubles.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcol05/qf4_3.jpg)*Olivier Ruel*
Oiso had clearly bounced back though, as he played back-to-back [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge)s after casting a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) the turn before, restocking his hand with an extra nine cards. He didn't go off though, instead passing the turn after playing a [Sapphire Medallion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion) to match his [Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night)scape Familiar. How many more cards would he need to draw before he could win a game in this match?


Therapy from Ruel naming [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) landed, revealing another three lands, [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries). Ruel then cast [Goblin Ringleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ringleader) (Oiso Leaked it), attacked with his team, and then sacrificed his Ringleader to flash the Therapy back, getting rid of the Faeries.


Oiso cast the first [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) of the match for four, but fizzled, as Ruel flipped over [Sapphire Medallion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion), [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), a land, and [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) for the Japanese player. Ruel imprinted a [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), cast [Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief), and another Ringleader, seeing the Warchief [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)ped back to his hand as he dropped Oiso to four life.


Oiso cast [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Stroke of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius), and then Stroked for four, leaving him with three untapped [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s. He then used one of those [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s to cast [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), and a second to cast [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), getting two [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) and [Turnabout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout). Oiso cast the Cloud Ruel gave him, [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)ped them back to his hand, cast them again, and then cast another [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), this time getting two [Merchant Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll) and a [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). Ruel gave Oiso a Scroll, and Oiso passed the turn with a grimace, as his deck crapped out on him.


Ruel cast three more goblins on his turn, burying Oiso's title hopes under an avalanche of Ringleader generated card advantage, discard, and just plain bad luck.


**Final Score**  
**Olivier Ruel 3, Masashi Oiso 0**


"He conceded to me to get me into the Top 8 yesterday," remarked Ruel, "so it feels a little bad to beat him. I wanted to play him because he is a great player -- the best player in this Top 8 -- but on the other hand it is sad to knock him out of this tournament. He deserved to advance much more than I did."
