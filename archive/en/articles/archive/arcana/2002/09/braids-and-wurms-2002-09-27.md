As we head into the *Onslaught* prerelease this weekend, we'll look back at a couple of the surprise hits of *Odyssey*. [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) and [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion) turned out to be two great cards from that set. As a sort of flashback, we'll look at their design sketches from the Style Guide.


The Wurms from [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) were originally concepted as "getting bigger as they ate artifacts." Although that idea wasn't used, you can see in the original sketch that one was shown eating a [Chimeric Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimeric+Idol). The basic look of the Wurms stayed the same.

Braids was never meant to be a card, but when Eric Peterson reinterpreted this Matt Wilson sketch for what was supposed to be [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), R&D decided to make Braids [her own card](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/rb12).
