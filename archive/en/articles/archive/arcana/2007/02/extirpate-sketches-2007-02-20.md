Extirpate is one of only two split second cards in *Planar Chaos* (the other being [Sulfur Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental)). Early on in the set's creation, the card was a "mind-control" spell inspired by [Word of Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Word+of+Command). But as more and more rules problems developed with the card, it became clear that a new direction was needed, and [Extirpate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) was born. 
 **ex路tir路pate**   
*verb*


1. to remove or destroy totally; do away with; exterminate.   
 2. to pull up by or as if by the roots; root up.


*Source: dictionary.com. Perhaps this card should have been in a recent [Lexicon](/en/articles/archive/lexicon-planar-chaos-edition-2007-01-31).*


 However, the card art still contains a hint of the card's earlier persona. The very minimalist art of [Word of Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Word+of+Command) depicts two eyes peering out of the darkness. Check out an early sketch for what would become [Extirpate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate):

In the sketch, a mysterious face fixes its gaze at the viewer. See how the eyes are highlighted while the rest of the face is in shadow? A reference to [Word of Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Word+of+Command).


As [Extirpate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) took on its new rules text, it gained the split second mechanic, which has a distinctive "jump cut" [visual cue](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1180) in card art.

In the final art, the art now depicts a jump cut between a victim right before having his thoughts ripped out of his head, and right after-a perfect illustration for the card as it is today. But it still retains that halo of highlighting around the eyes.
