Released in July 1995, this 125-card set was created in an effort to satisfy players' demand for out-of-print cards. Over half of the cards were from *Legends*, but the set also included cards from *Arabian Nights*, *Antiquities*, and *The Dark*.


R***enaissance***


When *Fourth Edition* was released, a good number of cards were rotated in and out of the base game. In non-English editions, many cards would be released in white-bordered "reprint" format before ever appearing in the black-bordered "original printing" format. This series was an attempt to correct the situation by making black-bordered versions available in those languages.
