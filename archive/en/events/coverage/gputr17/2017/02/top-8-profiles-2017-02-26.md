**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Elder Deep-Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend), it was the MVP. It's good against aggro and control. Many times I play it at the end of my opponent's turn and then I combo off.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return), because nobody expects it. Especially when I side them in against G/B Energy.
