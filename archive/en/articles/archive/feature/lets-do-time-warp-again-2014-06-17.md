Last week, Friday Nights went "[Time Walking](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/303)," thanks to Jer's Take Another Turn deck. During that trip through space and time (but mostly time), Jer noted that there were 29 "take an extra turn" cards. But, thanks to the release of *Conspiracy* (which Jer didn't yet have access to), there are now officially 30 such cards.


Are you a master of time? A [Sage of Hours](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+Hours)? Is this your [Last Chance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Chance) to test your time knowledge? Do you think you know what it takes to do the [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp)...again?


Take the quiz below and find out!


**1. What was the original text on [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) way back when Richard Garfield was playtesting Alpha?** 


Click to reveal.



"Target player loses next turn."


Thankfully, the wording was changed before the release of Alpha, as there's another, far more game-ending way to interpret "loses next turn."



**2. Blue has the most "take an extra turn" cards by a wide margin, but every other color gets to at least dip its toe in the time pool (oddly enough, not yet a card name). After blue, which color has the second most "take an extra turn" cards?**


1. White—Nope! White barely makes the list at all, as [Medomai the Ageless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Medomai+the+Ageless) is both blue and white and is white's only card on the list.
2. Black—Wrong! Black is almost as bad as white. [Temporal Extortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Extortion)*sometimes* gives you an extra turn, but [Time Sieve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Sieve) is black's only other way to travel through time—a card it shares with blue.
3. Red—Correct! The only surprising part is that it's not the only right answer! Red's five entrants—[Final Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune), [Warrior's Oath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warrior%27s+Oath), [Last Chance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Chance), [Stitch in Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitch+in+Time), and [Ral Zarek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ral+Zarek)—are tied with another option for most time-walkable cards.
4. Green—Wrong! Green just gets [Seedtime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedtime) here, but, unlike white, at least it gets that card in mono-green. White doesn't even get that.
5. Trick question, Blake, it's colorless—Also correct! Tied with red at five is, surprisingly, colorless. It's a bit of a cheat, however, as one of them requires blue mana to work. The list is: [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn), [Timesifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timesifter), [Magistrate's Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magistrate%27s+Scepter), [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault), and blue-aligned but technically colorless [Magosi, the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magosi%2C+the+Waterveil).

**3. What is the difference in converted mana cost (the number in the top right corner of the card) between the cheapest card that lets you take an extra turn, and the most expensive?**


1. 4—Wrong! This is the difference between 2 and 6, two of the more common converted mana costs for [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) effects, but not the extreme at either end.
2. 8—Wrong! [Beacon of Tomorrows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Tomorrows) costs 8, but it's not the most expensive!
3. 15—Right! [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) costs 15 and [Magosi, the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magosi%2C+the+Waterveil), although it has an activation cost, costs 0 to actually get on the battlefield!
4. 17—Wrong! You overshot juuuuust a bit. [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) costs 15 mana and is the most expensive one, so it has to be lower than that.

**4. What "take an extra turn" card has been reprinted (with different names) at exactly the same cost with exactly the same text most often?**


Click to reveal.



This one is tricky. We'll give credit for either [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) or [Final Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune). [Final Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune) has been reprinted as both [Last Chance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Chance) and [Warrior's Oath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warrior%27s+Oath), but with one small difference that isn't actually much of a difference—[Final Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune) is an instant while the other two are sorceries.


[Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), on the other hand, has been brought back as [Temporal Manipulation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Manipulation) and [Capture of Jingzhou](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Capture+of+Jingzhou) (interestingly, in the same sets as [Last Chance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Chance) and [Warrior's Oath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warrior%27s+Oath), respectively) but with just one small tweak—[Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) targeted a player, the other two did not.



**5. There are 30 cards in **Magic** that grant the ability or possibility of taking an extra turn, but if you do a Gatherer search for "an extra turn," the list returns 31 cards. What is that 31st card?**


Click to reveal.



[Stranglehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stranglehold), a *Commander* release that prevents players from taking an extra turn.



**6. In Jer's Singleton Take Another Turn Deck, he said he wasn't playing [Search the City](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+the+City) because it was "dumb," but why would [Search the City](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+the+City) never let Jer take another turn in that deck anyway?** 


Click to reveal.



Jer was playing Singleton, a format that only lets you play one copy of any given card. [Search the City](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+the+City), as it turns out, only lets you take another turn if your deck is good at playing cards with the same name as other cards in your deck—something you can't do in Singleton.



**7. How many "take an extra turn" cards have been restricted or banned in any format (not counting *Commander*)?**


1. 0—Nope! These cards are dangerous. Surely at least one was restricted at some point in time...
2. 1—You might guess that [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) is the only one that's seen a ban, as it's currently banned in Legacy and restricted in Vintage, but you're a little bit short...
3. 2—Right-o! [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) and [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) are both currently restricted in Vintage and banned in Legacy. And for good reason.
4. 4—That's a few too many! Ever since [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) was printed, R&D has been very careful with printing cards that let you take an extra turn. In fact, the first attempt at trying it again made you lose the game at the end of that extra turn (e.g., [Final Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune))!

**8. Ignoring [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) and [Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault), the original "take an extra turn" turn cards, which "take an extra turn" card currently has the highest rating in Gatherer, as voted on by the community? The lowest?**



Somewhat surprisingly, a card that makes you lose the game shortly after casting it beats out an Eldrazi. The highest-rated card in Gatherer that lets you take an extra turn is [Final Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune), with an average of 4.447 stars (out of 5). [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) "only" got 4.405. [Second Chance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Chance), [Lighthouse Chronologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist), and [Magistrate's Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magistrate%27s+Scepter) round out the Top 5.




The hall of shame for "take an extra turn" cards starts with [Search the City](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+the+City), which manages only 2.146 stars out of 5 from the community. [Wormfang Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wormfang+Manta); [Magosi, the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magosi%2C+the+Waterveil); [Medomai the Ageless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Medomai+the+Ageless); and [Notorious Throng](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notorious+Throng) round out the Bottom 5.
