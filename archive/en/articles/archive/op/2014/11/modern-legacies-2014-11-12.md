November 12, 2014
 










Last November, Washington DC played host to [a Legacy Grand Prix](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpwas13/welcome) that featured 1,698 players and a host of [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s, fetch lands, original dual lands, creatures ranging from the [small but powerful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) to the [towering and limitless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn), enchantments, artifacts, Planeswalkers, and a tribal strategy or two (and likely more).


As of Monday morning, the confirmed preregistration for North America's next Legacy Grand Prix, taking place in New Jersey this weekend, reached 2,230.


Just let that sink in for a minute.


2,230.


With event and judge staffs that rival and even exceed the numbers of the record-shattering [Grand Prix Las Vegas](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpveg13/welcome), Grand Prix New Jersey is well on its way to having its own place in history as the world's largest Legacy tournament.


But let's not get ahead of ourselves here. First up...


Grand Prix Madrid
=================


What is the happy medium between [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s, [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes), [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell)s, etc., and khans, gods, and the occasional Nissa or four?


[Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch)s? [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay)s? [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn)s? [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)s? [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike)s? [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s? [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod)s?


All of those are correct. But if you want to get specific, let's tweak that question a bit.


What's the happy medium between *Legacy* and *Standard*?


Why that would be Modern, of course! And Grand Prix Madrid will be Modern's first big opportunity to shine since the release of *Khans of Tarkir*.


Modern is oftentimes known as the format where one player expects only minor shifts in the format to take place with each set release, and where one can master a deck archetype over a span of months. We've seen this at both the Grand Prix-level and the Pro Tour-level. Players like Sam Pardee and Jacob Wilson championed Melira Pod at each and every event, adjusting for the current week's expected metagame. Players like Patrick Dickmann championed [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), shifting the deck to meet whatever challenges that were expected for each specific event.


*Khans of Tarkir*, if you have been following every other Constructed format, is not a set known for the small shifts it causes. It's known instead for causing big, seismic disturbances, even in formats such as Vintage.


Modern has been the talk of many, and a few new tools from the new set are expected to shake up the format. Namely, tools such as [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy), [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Will these three cards change everything...or will their illustrious entrances be calm?


Players traveling to Madrid will find out this weekend.


The first 1,000 players to arrive at the venue and present their preregistration email will receive an event-exclusive playmat featuring artwork from [Svetlin Velinov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[22Svetlin+Velinov%22]) (who will also be at Madrid this weekend).

*Grand Prix Madrid event-exclusive playmat available to the first 1,000 players who arrive Friday and present their preregistration email.*
Aside from the main event, a full event schedule—including the ever-popular Super Sunday Series—runs alongside all three days. You can find the full event schedule at the [Grand Prix Madrid web site](http://gordianknotgames.co.uk/gpmadrid14.html).


If you can't make it to Madrid but want to watch all of the Modern action taking place, you can catch live coverage of this event on the [*Magic* Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/Magic) featuring Rich Hagon, Marijn Lybaert, Raphaël Lévy, Simon Görtzen, and Steven Leeming. Coverage begins Saturday at 1 p.m. local time/4 a.m. PT/7 a.m. ET/12 p.m. GMT and on Sunday at 9 a.m. local time/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/8 a.m. GMT.


Meanwhile, while Modern gets its big weekend...


Grand Prix New Jersey
=====================


Legacy will also be getting its time in the spotlight! Returning to that key point about this weekend's Legacy action.


*As of Monday*, 2,230 people have preregistered for the GP. That was two days ago. The number has only grown since then. Now, what are all of those players who plan on spending two days in New Jersey for Legacy going to get?


Well, this, for starters.


![](http://magic.wizards.com/sites/mtg/files/images/featured/GPNJ_Rewards.png)
*These Grand Prix New Jersey goodies are available to every player who plays in the main event!*
[Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and Legacy go hand-in-hand. The format-defining glue that holds many of Legacy's iconic decks together is the highlight in the event-exclusive playmat that will be given to every main-event participant.


But that's not all. Every main-event participant will also receive a deck box and an 80-count pack of sleeves that also show off the iconic [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) art from its release in *Mercadian Masques*.


Looking to get some more of those [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) sleeves? [StarCityGames.com](http://StarCityGames.com/) is also giving away packs of these sweet sleeves as prizes for anyone who wins a side event during the weekend. They're also guaranteed to anyone who enters a *Khans of Tarkir*Sealed Spectacular on Friday.


In addition to that, Grand Prix New Jersey is also extending a big welcome to the event's guest of honor, [John Avon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+[22John%20Avon%22]), one of *Magic*'s most celebrated artists. Known for his wide collection and variety of art in the game, ranging from the broad cityscapes of *Ravnica*'s bounce-lands like [Dimir Aqueduct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Aqueduct), to the widely popular basic lands from *Unhinged*, and everything in between, Avon's work has spanned multiple generations of *Magic*. Grand Prix New Jersey will provide a special opportunity to not only meet him, but also to get some of your cards signed by him.


Full details—including the complete list of side events taking place—can be found over on the [Grand Prix New Jersey web site](http://magicgp.com/).


If you're unable to attend New Jersey for the Grand Prix, you can still get in on some of the action at home. Live coverage of the Grand Prix will be found on the [SCGLive Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive) featuring Cedric Phillips, Patrick Sullivan, Matthias Hunt, and the rest of the SCGLive team.


Looking beyond even this weekend...


Worlds Week
===========


We're less than three weeks away from the start of the  [2014 World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/world-championship-event-types-events), which begins an epic week with five days of coverage featuring the best *Magic* that you can watch all year.

It all starts on Tuesday, December 2, at 9 a.m. local time/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/8 a.m. GMT with Day One of the World Championship. We'll be bringing you the latest from Nice, France, featuring 24 of the world's best competing for *Magic*'s greatest title, the $50,000 1st prize, and the trophy.
