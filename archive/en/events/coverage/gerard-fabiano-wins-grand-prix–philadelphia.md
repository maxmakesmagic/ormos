Gerard Fabiano Wins Grand Prix–Philadelphia
===========================================












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/Congrats%20Fabiano.jpg) "YES!" shouted an exultant Gerard Fabiano as Adam Yurchick extended his hand in the face of a lethal attack in the finals of Grand Prix-Philadelphia. "I have never actually won anything before!"


Throughout this Extended season players constantly sought new and exciting tech to earn a trip to Hollywood for the upcoming Pro Tour, but when Adam Yurchick and Gerard Fabiano clashed it was with two decks that had barely been seen since the Top 8 of Pro Tour-Valencia. Where everyone else had jumped on the blue-green Tron bandwagon, Adam went back to the blue-white build that put two players into the Top 8 in Spain. Gerard looked to Guilio Barra's Rock list for inspiration and walked away from the tournament with the first trophy of his storied career.


There were actually eight different decks archetypes in the Top 8 in all the deck categories from control to beatdown to combo but in the end...nothing beat Rock!


Congratulations to Gerard Fabiano the 2008 Grand Prix-Philadelphia champion!

Quarterfinals: Rocking the Wisp
-------------------------------


*By Tom Fowler*

Matt Hansen sat down for his first Grand Prix Top 8 against a player who is no stranger to the spotlight, Gerard Fabiano. Gerard took Giulio Barra's Top 4 deck from PT Valencia, made a few changes, and played his way into the Top 8. Matt piloted the [Tallowisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp) deck that has seen much success these last few weeks. Could the newcomer with the new deck take out the seasoned veteran?


Before the match, the players looked over each other's decklists. Gerard focused on Matt's sideboard, telling him he had "nothing" for the matchup. Antonino De Rosa joined in on the fun, and a few comments about card choices later, we were ready for the first game.


Game 1:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/sT8%20Hansen.jpg)*Matt Hansen*Both players kept their opening hands. Matt kicked things off with a [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath). Gerard spent his first turn going from 19 to 17 to 15, using a Heath to get [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb), then playing [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). Matt's showed [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Griffin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide), [Kami of Ancient Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law), [Intrepid Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intrepid+Hero), and [Troll Ascetic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic), from which Gerard picked the Troll. [Kami of Ancient Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) made it onto the table, then Gerard made Matt discard some more; [Gerrard's Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Verdict) binned [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and [Intrepid Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intrepid+Hero). Matt suited up the Kami with [Griffin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) and swung for 4, knocking Gerard to 11. Gerard fell to 9 for an untapped [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb), then showed a [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate), He pondered what to target before choosing the [Griffin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide); Matt responded by sacrificing the Kami to destroy the guide, netting himself a 2/2 Griffin token.


A swing from the token took Gerard to 7. Matt added a [Tallowisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp) to his board. Gerard went to 6 for a fetchland, then went back to 10 when [Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) came into play. The token dinged Gerard for 2 again. Matt played [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) and passed. Gerard sent his Hierarch into the red zone, taking Matt to 15, then played his second Hierarch, going up to 12. Gerard's next attack was with both elephants; Teeg and [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) combined to take one down (with the Village dying in the exchange), and Matt was at 11. Gerard used [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) to get a [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) back and played [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). The persistent Griffin token knocked Gerard to 7, and Matt had a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) of his own.


Gerard had the [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate), though, and sent his Goyf and Hierarch into combat. Teeg jumped in the way of the Goyf, leaving Matt at 7. Gerard played another [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), getting [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) this time. [Tallowisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp) got to do something on Matt's next turn, as [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) allowed Matt to search for [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak). Gerard [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)d [Tallowisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp) and swung with his team. [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) blocked [Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch), the Griffin token blocked [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and Matt fell to 3. To keep his opponent's life total nice and manageable, Gerard took [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak) with [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). Another attack with the team was enough.


Fabiano 1, Hansen 0


The easy banter that preceded the first game was gone now, replaced by quiet thought as the players considered their sideboard options.


Game 2:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/sT8%20Fabiano.jpg)*Gerard Fabiano*This time, both players shipped their first seven back for better sixes. Fetchlands came and went, but the first relevant play was Matt's third-turn [Troll Ascetic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic). The Troll soon put on an [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak), and the attack left life totals at 23-14 for Matt. To make sure Gerard didn't have an answer, Matt played [Orim's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) during his upkeep. Gerard could only play a land and attack with the [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) he summoned the previous turn. Matt put a second [Armadillo Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak) on his Troll and bashed with the 7/6. Gerard fell to 7, while Matt gained 14 life to go to 35. Gerard fetched an [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) at the end of Matt's turn, and found [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) atop his deck when he drew. After swinging with the Witness, Gerard cleared the board of creatures and played [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top).


Matt restocked his board with [Kami of Ancient Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) and [Intrepid Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intrepid+Hero). Gerard [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed the Hero and played [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth). He [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)d the Kami before attacking Matt to 29 with the Baloth. Matt played [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), but it was not long for the game; Gerard retrieved [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) with his fresh [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) and killed everyone's favorite Lhurgoyf. Matt fell to 23 from the attack, and to 12 next turn, as the Baloth and two Witnesses were joined by Gerard's animated [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village).


Needing an answer, Matt ripped [Eladamri's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri%27s+Call), finding and playing [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur). Gerard swung with the team again. The Centaur took out Baloth, and after combat damage and the Baloth's ability resolved, Gerard had come all the way back to lead the race 8-5. He made it 12-5 with [Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch). Matt played [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus) and held one card in his hand. In case it were a useful card, Gerard played [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize); Matt pitched [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). Gerard swung with his Hierarch and two Witnesses. [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) blocked the Hierarch and [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus) squashed [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), but Matt fell to 3. Gerard dropped [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) and passed the turn. Matt attacked with his two creatures and activated [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus) for lethal damage. Gerard activated his Deed, clearing the board of anything costing 4 or less—including his own [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), which he forgot to use in response to the Deed. It didn't matter, as he still had [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), which took down a [Tallowisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp), then finished off a defenseless Matt next turn.


Final result: Gerard Fabiano defeated Matt Hansen 2-0.




Quarterfinals: Ben Wienburg vs. Luis Scott-Vargas
-------------------------------------------------


*By Eli Kaplan*

Before starting the match off, the two pored over the other's decklist and traded a few amicable anecdotes of tournaments past and the travel that comes with it. Both players had traveled for many hours to reach the City of Brotherly Love but only one would advance to the next stage.


This matchup hinged upon Luis Scott-Vargas's ability to thwart Wienburg's cutthroat early beats. Wienburg's build of Gaea's Might Get There used vicious early one and two mana beaters such as [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isamaru%2C+Hound+of+Konda), and Tarmagoyf to get there firstest with the mostest. [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) and Gaea's Might helped his army punch through the Swiss with insanely quick wins. Scott-Vargas' Next Level Blue had a variety of wrenches to throw into Wienburg's works. A full four of [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty), Tarmagoyf, and the infamous [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) / [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) suite sought to shut down Wienburg's attack lane.


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/sT8%20Wienberg.jpg)*Ben Wienburg*Wienburg won the die roll, choosing to play first, and sent his first hand back to the kitchen. He beamed at his second hand, breaking a [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) for an untapped [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry). [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) hit the table. Luis's first turn was also brimming with action. A [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) imprinting [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) set up [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance).


Wienburg kept up the pace with a second turn [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), which slipped through the [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). He kept attacking and playing untapped shocklands and Gaea's Might, throwing everything he could at Scott-Vargas. The American champion was down to 6. Two [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty) whittled down the attacks, and a Scott-Vargas Tarmagoyf shored up his defenses.


Turn after turn, Wienburg's attempts to play spells bore no fruit. [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix), and [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) all got quashed by the relentless [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) combo. Scott-Vargas stabilized and started to attack with a 4/5 Tarmagoyf. With sixteen points of damage self-inflicted by a combination of Odyssey fetchlands and Ravnica [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)lands, Wienburg had to change gears to defense. Luis had deflected the tide and cut through for the win.


Luis Scott-Vargas 1-0 Ben Wienburg


### Game 2


Ben chose to lead off and kept his initial hand. His first two turns looked great, leading off with a 2/3 [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), then an [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Isamaru%252C%2BHound%2Bof%2BKonda) and [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) eager to lay into Luis's life total. Scott-Vargas's first turn [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) and a [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) imprinting [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) allowed Luis to steal the tapped 2/3 [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) for full value with [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty).


The Ape's loyalty bounced back and forth. Wienburg [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)d the Threads but Scott-Vargas had a second Threads to steal the Ape right back. Wienburg insisted on reclaiming his 2/3, throwing yet another [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) at the fresh Threads. A timely [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) thwarted Wienburg's attempts to summon a Tarmagoyf. In the meantime, the Hound and Fanatic pounded away at Scott-Vargas's life.


The end game was very bloody and very messy. Luis kept throwing the Tarmagoyf in the way of Wienburg's attacking men, blocking [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Isamaru%252C%2BHound%2Bof%2BKonda), then [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), then another [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). But Wienburg kept topdecking beaters and sending them into harm's way and eventually the persistent little critters dragged Vargas down.


Luis Scott-Vargas 1-1 Ben Wienburg


### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/sT8%20Vargas.jpg)*Luis Scott-Vargas*Both players liked their initial hands in Game 3. Scott-Vargas had the tempo advantage and was able to keep the early beats to a minimum with [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty). Wienburg's [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) burned away Scott-Vargas's second turn Tarmagoyf before the Future Sight MVC could get out of hand. Scott-Vargas made another 2/3 Tarmagoyf and let Wienburg's [Isamaru, Hound of Konda](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Isamaru%252C%2BHound%2Bof%2BKonda) come through. Wienburg jumped at the window of opportunity to hammer his opponent down to 10.


The two players kept throwing spells at each other at breakneck speed, trading back and forth. Wienburg tried a [Kami of Ancient Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) and Tarmagoyf, but they kept getting batted away by Luis's countermagic. Stuck on two life, three lands and a [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), Scott-Vargas was in trouble. He let Wienburg make a Bob, saving his countermagic for Wienburg's own Tarmagoyfs. [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) shut down Vargas's stashed [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). With one creature to Ben's two, Luis's hopes rested on a timely topdeck.


[Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) came to the rescue, with [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) up his sleeve. Now it was Wienburg's turn to topdeck. He had two chances. A [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) or [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) the first time would get the job done. The second draw required a Craig Jones-like performance. Only [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) would suffice. But the well had run dry. Scott-Vargas's Tarmagoyf came in for the win.


Final result: Luis Scott-Vargas defeated Ben Wienburg 2-1 to advance to the semifinals.




Quarterfinals: Tyler Mantey vs. Paul Mathews
--------------------------------------------


*By Zaiem Beg*

Tyler and Paul played each other earlier in the day, with Paul's TEPS deck defeating Tyler's Doran deck 2-0, so the players were already familiar with each other – and their decks.


### Game 1


After winning the die roll, Tyler looked at his opening hand but didn't like it, so he went to six cards and found them acceptable. Paul did not return the mulligan favor, as he kept his hand of seven.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/sT8%20Mantey.jpg)*Tyler Mantey*Tyler played a [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), but Paul made TEPS's best turn one play by suspending [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). Paul answered with a turn two [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), who was no bigger than a lowly [Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squire). But when Paul's land was [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)d the following turn, [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) got upgraded to [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) size and started the pressure.


Paul was content to do nothing as he looked at the [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) counters ticking down and passed the turn back to Tyler, who activated [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to put Paul to 13.


[Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) came into play and Paul looked at the Bloom and thought for a while, then tried to combo off. He played [Rite of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame), [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star), [Channel the Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+the+Suns), [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), and [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) for five copies with two black mana remaining in his mana pool.


When [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) revealed [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), [Rite of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame), [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), and [Rite of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame), Tyler was hopeful that Paul was going to whiff on his combo but not flipping a win condition. Paul then said, "If I show you the [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) in my hand, will you scoop?" Tyler said he would, Paul revealed the [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) in his hand, and they started shuffling up for Game 2.


"I liked the mana accelerants as long as you didn't have a [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) in your hand," Tyler said.


"I could have not floated two black and cast another spell, but it was only for five, so it was risky," Paul replied.


### Game 2


Tyler declared he would play first. "[Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ing," Paul said good-naturedly. Both liked their opening hands. Tyler played a turn one [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), and Paul played the turn one [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) again. But Tyler made a flashy play with a turn two Doran, putting Paul on a fast clock. With one counter left on [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), Tyler played [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) on Tyler, taking away Paul's all-important [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) and followed it up with a [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), severely limiting Paul's options.


Staring at Doran and [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), now equipped with [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), Paul realized he had to try to win. He played [Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact) on [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) and tried to go off, but when he played a [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) and looked at the top five cards of his library, he leaned back in exasperation. "Oh my gosh. Really? *Really?*" Paul sighed and said, "You got me. That's all I've got," and conceded the game.


### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/sT8%20Mathews.jpg)*Paul Mathews*"Did I really lose that? I feel like I won that game. I feel like I should be getting up and getting a soda," Paul said.


Both players kept their hands of seven and Paul started off with yet another turn one [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). "How about that," Tyler said.


But Tyler played the one-of [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) on Paul. "You and your one [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)!" Paul complained, as he saw his [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) hit the graveyard. Tyler followed his turn one discard with two Cabal Therapies, ripping apart Paul's hand and putting him into topdeck mode. When Tyler's [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) was sacrificed to flash back [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), leaving Paul with a lonely [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) in his hand, Paul knew he was in serious trouble.


"If I win this game, how epic would it be?" Paul asked.  

"I would probably cry," Tyler said.  

"It's worth it just for that, then," Paul replied.  

"Well, that's not very nice!" Tyler said with a smile.


Facing the beatdown with a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) with an [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) and a [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), Paul knew he was dead next turn and tried to go off a measly [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and two land, but after drawing his card off [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), he revealed his hand of three land and extended his hand.


Final result: Tyler Mantey defeated Paul Mathews 2-1 to move on to the semifinals.




Quarterfinals: Jon Sonne vs. Adam Yurchick
------------------------------------------


*By Tom LaPille*

Jon Sonne is a longtime Magic Pro who happens to have won the last Grand Prix held here in Philadelphia. Adam Yurchick may carry less name recognition than Jon, but made the top four of Grand Prix Minneapolis in 2005 and was the eleventh highest rated constructed player in the world after this past season's World Championships in New York.


This weekend, Jon eschewed the goblins that served him here so well last time for a green-black [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) deck, while Adam played a blue-white based Urzatron control deck. Both decks are built to win the long game, but other than [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) all of Jon's long game cards pale in comparison to Adam's [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan)s, [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver)s, and Decrees of Justice. Jon's goal in the matchup is to leverage his [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s, [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth)s, and [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)s to kill Adam as quickly as possible before Adam's superior long-game bombs overwhelm him. Adam, on the other hand, is just looking to buy time whenever he can until he can use his expensive spells to take Jon out of the game


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/sT8%20Sonne.jpg)*Jon Sonne*Adam mulliganed to five, while Jon kept his seven. The first action of the game was a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) from Jon that was [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend)ed, which found Adam his third land. He still didn't have a fourth, but a [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) cycled for no tokens found it. Jon kept swinging with a second [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and a [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) that was [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed, finding Yurchick yet another land. That Baloth met a [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) on its second attempt to enter play; a second Baloth resolved, but Adam's [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) took Jon back to having nothing but lands in play.


Jon had drawn all three of his [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)s, but they had been dormant in the early turns. Now he had no other action, so they got to attack twice along with a new [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). Yurchick, however, drew a [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) that allowed him to complete his Urzatron and play an imposing [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan). Adam was only at seven life, however, so Jon's three [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)s and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) would be lethal through the Titan if Jon could activate all of the Treetops at once.


Sonne had a different plan: he simply cast a [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) for five after fetching a land with the Elder. Adam [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed to buy a turn, finding him another Urzatron land. Jon replayed the [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud), but Adam had drawn a crushing [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) that gave him twelve 1/1 Soldier tokens thanks to all of his Urzatron lands. After all was said and done with the [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud), Adam untapped with a [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan), seven soldiers, and two life to Jon's [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb), [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), and eighteen life. Adam attacked with the Titan and three Soldiers, taking Sonne to eight. Jon drew his card, then conceded to Yurchick's army.


Jon Sonne 0-1 Adam Yurchick


### Game 2


Jon surprised everyone by choosing to draw first. Adam mulliganed to six; Jon kept seven again. Jon started faster this time with a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) that took a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and revealed that Adam had no sources of blue mana, but a [Skycloud Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skycloud+Expanse) on turn three solved that problem. Jon accelerated with two [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s and cast another [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) that took Adam's [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and left Adam with only three mana sources in hand. Jon attempted to capitalize on his opponent's weakened state with an [Indrik Stomphowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indrik+Stomphowler).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/sT8%20Yurchick.jpg)*Adam Yurchick*An [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) from Sonne was [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed, but he followed with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). Adam's [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) in response let him discard a Mox and found him an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) and a [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend), but Sonne's [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) relieved Adam of the [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend). Yurchick wanted Sonne's Stomphowler to go away, so in an odd twist of fate it found itself under an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) after Adam transmuted a [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) for [Academy Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins). The Ruins combined with the [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) in Adam's graveyard would produce a [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) lock as soon as Adam found an [Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower) to complete his urzatron, so Jon needed to act quickly.


After a long think, that action took the form of an [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) that brought a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) back into play and a fresh [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) from Jon's hand. Adam found a miracle next turn in the form of [Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower); using his newly supercharged mana, he burned through a [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) and [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), but all of those new cards paled in comparison to the threat of Adam's [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) lock going online next turn.


Jon untapped and drew; Adam's draw spells meant that he had no access to blue mana this turn, but would Sonne be able to capitalize before he lost control of his own turns for the rest of the game? An attack from the [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) took Adam to fourteen, but Jon's [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) wasn't enough: Adam simply put the [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) on top of his deck, drew it, played another [Urza's Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Mine), and [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver)ed Sonne. Jon saw that the lock was complete, and conceded.


Final result: Adam Yurchick defeated Jon Sonne in two games to advance to the semifinals of Grand Prix Philadelphia!




Semifinals: Going to the Next Level
-----------------------------------


*By Riki Hayashi*

United States National Champion Luis Scott-Vargas continues his Clark Kent/ Superman routine with teammate Paul Cheon, alternating romps through Constructed Grand Prixes, rarely finishing well together. After going to the Previous Level for GP Vancouver, the Cheontourage is back to the Next Level with [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). Adam Yurchick doesn't have quite the trophy collection of his opponent, just a GP Top 8 in Minneapolis to his credit among major finishes, but he is favored here with his blue-white Tron deck, affectionately called "Next Level Tron."


Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/SF%20Yurchick.jpg)*Adam Yurchick*"My last round, I had two [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty) and a [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) in my opening hand [against Zoo]. I'm pretty sure I don't want that here," said Luis after reviewing Adam's decklist. [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) was an ineffective answer to Tron's big mana spells like [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan), [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), and [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice).


After some quick shuffling, the two players started game 1 with the usual handshake and "good lucks"— "Although, I think I'll need more," said Luis, seeming somewhat resigned to his fate in this matchup.


Scott-Vargas opened with a quick [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) into a [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), trying to fill up his graveyard quickly to steal the game. Meanwhile, Adam developed his mana base with two Tron pieces and a Signet.


On turn three, Adam dropped the hammer.


Boom!


His third Tron piece allowed Yurchick to play [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) -- a 7/10 on the third turn. Oh, and it also happened to blow up two of Luis's lands, a [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) and an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). A murmur of amazement spread through the large crowd gathered to watch.


Turn three.


[Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan).


I can't say that enough because after that the game was over except for the formalities. Luis attempted to set up at least some defense, adding the Counter-top combo to his board of [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), but Adam crushed even those meager dreams.


"[Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) for two."


Luis scooped them up. "I knew it wasn't a good matchup, but I have to admit..." Luis trailed off, amazed at the blow out.


Adam Yurchick 1 – Luis Scott-Vargas 0


Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/SF%20ScottVargas.jpg)*Luis Scott-Vargas*Luis thought long and hard about his sideboarding. Adam changed his mind in the middle of shuffling, perhaps trying to outthink Luis's answers like [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), which were certain to replace useless cards like Threads.


Luis had to mulligan to six and opened with a [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain). He Moxed to get a T2 [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) during his mainphase, ducking Adam's countermagic.


After a hallowed Fountain of his own, Adam laid two Tron pieces, threatening another early Titan. Luckily for LSV, not only did Adam not have the third Tron piece, he didn't even have a fourth land.


The only offense that Luis could muster to take advantage was a lonely [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) getting [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top).


Adam struggled to find good plays, dropping an [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) for 0 to destroy Luis's [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). Luis assembled two Tops, but no [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance).


Adam Moxed an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) to get his fourth mana source to keep up.


After a few turns of [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) attacks, Luis played [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg). Adam said "Yeah," knowing how much trouble he could be in if that card stuck. [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), a very unusual card choice, helped Adam Yurchick solve the first Teeg, which Luis immediately followed up with his second.


Adam transmuted [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) to get his final Tron piece and passed the turn ominously. With really no choice, LSV attacked with [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) and Teeg into the waiting clutches of a cycled [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) for 6.


With his second Kithkin Advisor dead, Luis resorted to [Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) to free his first [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) from Oblivion. Yurchick calmly dropped another [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), and knowing he was on the ropes, Luis sarcastically asked for the target. Adam pointed to Teeg, dropped a [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) and the Cleveland native punched his ticket to the GP Philadelphia finals.


When I asked him about it, Adam told me that his turn three [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) in game 1 was his earliest of the weekend, "Although I got one on turn four against Chapin."


"Figures. Figures," said Luis. "I would have had you if you hadn't done that."


Final result: Adam Yurchick defeated Luis Scott-Vargas 2-0




Semifinals: Discard/Dat Card
----------------------------


*By Brian David-Marshall*

"So what are you going to side in against me," asked Gerard as the two players looked over each other's lists prior to the start of the semifinals.


"I am sure you can figure it out..."


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/SF%20Fabiano.jpg)*Gerard Fabiano*Tyler started off with a mulligan and Gerard compounded matters by nabbing a Bird of Paradise out his hand with Thoughtsieze before the Doran player could even lay a land. He followed up the next turn with [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate). Gerard used his own [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) to take out one of Tyler's lands and went right up to Hierarch on turn four.


Tyler went to seventeen from a fetchland/shock land combo and made a 3/4 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) on his next turn. Gerard attacked past it and had another Thoughtsieze. He looked at a hand with [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Umezawa%2527s%2BJitte), Hierarch, Thoughtsieze, and [Profane Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command) and took the elephant before playing [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed).


"You have no cards in your hand?" asked Tyler who realized that his Thoughtsieze was dead.


"No cards."


Gerard had another Hierearch waiting on top of his deck. Tyler played the [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Umezawa%2527s%2BJitte) but only had three mana total. He had to chump one of the Hierarchs and fell to five. He played a Doran and Gerard pointed at his looming Deed as if to say, 'do we need to go through the motions?'.


Tyler shrugged, "I'll make you do it..."


Gerard tapped three mana and they moved onto Game 2.


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/SF%20Mantey.jpg)*Tyler Mantey*"I was hoping you would not have the Thoughtsieze on turn one," sighed Tyler.


"Yeah it would have been a different game if you had played that Bird on turn one."


"I was just hoping you did not have it."


Tyler went to seventeen and tried to cold call a [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) but nobody was home. He played [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) on turn two and [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)d Gerard's [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) a turn later. All of Gerard's cards cost three or more. Tyler played another Bob and flashed back [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) naming [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) and saw three [Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) and [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) in hand for Gerard – no lands though. Another [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) stripped away the elephants and was promptly flashed back for a freshly drawn Deed. Gerard drew a land and was able to [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) the [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) but was getting beat down by a fat 'Goyf.


He was at five when he drew a fourth land to go one-for-one with the Damanation on the Goyf. Tyler played Hierarch. Gerard looked like he might be able to climb back in with Eternal Withess for Hierarch but Tyler also had Doran and Gerard did not have enough time, mana, or cards to wiggle out from under the two fatties.


### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/SF%20Fabiano2.jpg)Tyler took three to try for a first turn [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) with [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) again but missed. Gerard went to sixteen from his lands and deployed [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) while Tyler played 'Goyf. Gerard's [Gerrard's Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard%27s+Verdict) nabbed [Indrik Stomphowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indrik+Stomphowler) and [Putrefy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) and he went to 12 on Tyler's next attack.


A timely [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) got back the Verdict although Gerard tucked it away for later preferring to play [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Tyler played Doran and swung in with the Goyf. Gerard tried to puzzle out the virtual stats and Tyler made things simple. "They will trade if you block." Gerard traded. His next Verdict nabbed [Mortify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify) and [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), leaving Tyler with one card. Gerard provided Doran fodder in the form of a Tribe Elder. He went to eight when he had to let a Treetop rumble through.


Tyler flashed back his long-ago Therapy at the cost of his Doran to nab the Hierarch in Gerard's hand. Gerard [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)d one [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and traded his own for Tyler's second. Both players went into top deck mode as Tyler [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)d Gerard's Witness and a [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed).


Gerard found [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) but the top of his deck offered no threats – only land and [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)s. That was good enough to take out Tyler's [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) though. He eventually found [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) which started to bang away at Tyler's life total until eventually Tyler laid down a hand of three lands.


Tyler declared the [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) to be the difference in the match as both players were empty-handed when it hit the table and basically allowed Gerard to "draw" three cards.


Final result: Gerard Fabiano won the semifinals in three games and advanced to the finals to face the winner of the LSV/Yurchick pairing.




Finals: Rock Around the Clock
-----------------------------


*By Tom Fowler*

After two days of play and 15 rounds of Swiss, it all came down to one final match. In one corner sat Gerard Fabiano, no stranger to the lights of the Sunday stage, with his Rock deck. Across from him was Adam Yurchick, playing in his first Grand Prix finals, and hoping his U/W Tron deck would make his first final a winning one.


Game 1:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/Finals%20Fabiano%202.jpg)After no mulligans, Adam kicked off the finals with a [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West). Gerard went on the 19-17-15 plan, fetching [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) and playing [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). Adam showed a hand of two [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)s, [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), and two lands, from which Gerard took Thirst. [Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower) came down for Adam, along with [Azorius Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Signet). Gerard added [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) to his board over the next two turns, going back up to 18. Adam answered with [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), which Gerard split as [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) and [Azorius Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Signet) in one pile, and three lands in the other. Adam took the pile with spells. Gerard knocked Adam to 12 with a swing from the Hierarch, then played a second 4/4 in the form of [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth).


Adam halted the hemorrhaging with [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God); Gerard sacrificed his Baloth to go to 22 in response. Gerard then played [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) and activated it for 2, taking out both of Adam's Signets. A pair of [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s from Gerard was met with a cycled [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) from Adam, netting him two Soldier tokens. Gerard [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed one of the tokens and attacked with both his Elders. One was blocked and one got through; Adam fell to 11 and Gerard searched out a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Gerard added to his board with another Hierarch, going to 25. Adam got rid of the Hierarch with [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), but still fell to 10 from an Elder. [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) from Gerard snagged two other [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)s from Adam's hand; he also saw [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend). One Elder took Adam to 9, and the [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) stopped another from coming into play.


[Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) got in there again, taking Adam down to 8. Gerard tried to follow that with [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), but Adam had another [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend). Gerard ditched his Elder to flashback [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), taking [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). On his next turn, Gerard played [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) and spun it into [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), to which Adam responded by cycling Decree for four Soldier tokens. Adam completed the Urzatron as the tokens took Gerard to 19, then 15. Gerard spun his top into [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate), which took out [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). With his Hierarch back, Gerard was up to 19 life. The four Soldiers blocked Hierarch when it swung. Gerard played [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), getting back another Witness. When Gerard tried to add [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to his creatures, Adam had another [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) ready. The two Witnesses took Adam to 2, and when Gerard [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)d for his only card, Adam packed it in.


Fabiano 1, Yurchick 0.


The players sideboarded quietly, each making a few changes. The only sound from either of them was Adam asking the table judge how much time they had to finish sideboarding and shuffling.


Game 2:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpphi08/Finals%20Yurchick.jpg)Both players kept their opening hands again. Adam again started with [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West). Gerard had a tapped land of his own in [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). Two Urza lands allowed Adam to play a face-down creature. Gerard went to 17 for a [Godless Shrine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine) and [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate)d Adam's [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West). Adam finished the Tron and played [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), imprinting [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel). The morph got in there, taking Gerard to 15. Gerard played [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction); Adam responded by cycling [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice), the Urzatron letting him make five soldiers. Gerard named [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) for his [Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extract)ion, taking the two from Adam's deck. [Skycloud Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skycloud+Expanse) allowed Adam to turn up [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) and attack for 9. With the life totals at 24-6 and no help on the way, Gerard called it a game.


Fabiano 1, Yurchick 1.


Before the third game, the players exchanged GP Top 8 stories, with Gerard needing help from Antonino De Rosa to get his exact count and locatons. For extra luck in the final game, Gerard pulled his own Pro Player card from his wallet and set it on the table. He put it away before the game began.


Game 3:


This game began just like the last, only in reverse order: Gerard played [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and Adam played [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West). Gerard dropped a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), while Adam started working on the Urzatron. [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) got in there, taking Adam to 17. An untapped [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) left Adam at 15; he soon fell to 12 from [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). Gerard took 3 for [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb), but his [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) was stopped by [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) now had a real power value, so Gerard attacked with it and the Village to send Adam to 7. [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) took care of [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Gerard got his [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) the second time, going to 15, and seeing a hand of [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan), [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend), [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain), and [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West). He took the [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend).


[Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) brought Gerard back up to 19. All Adam could do was ponder the board and drop another [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West). Gerard drew his card and shuffled a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) back and forth in his hand. He knew all of Adam's cards save for the one he had just drawn. Was it worth a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to see it? Gerard went into the tank for a minute to think it over, then decided against it. He animated [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and, staring down lethal damage, Adam extended the hand.


Congratulations to Gerard Fabiano, Grand Prix Philadelphia 2008 Champion!
