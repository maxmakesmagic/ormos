Round 10: Feature Match - Tuan Nguyen vs. Ashton Chapman
--------------------------------------------------------


*by Steve Sadin* 

Tuan Nguyen has played in a few Grand Prix before, but this is the first time that he's made it to Day Two. And Nguyen didn't just scrape into the second day of play, he ended Day One with a perfect 9-0 record.


Even though Nguyen is playing in his first Grand Prix Day Two today, he still has significantly more high level tournament experience than his opponent this round -- Ashton Chapman, a judge who is playing in his first ever Grand Prix, and his first competitive event in three years!

*Tuan Nguyen (left) and Ashton Chapman (right) Face Off in Round 10*

### Game 1


After laying out their opening hands, Nguyen wished his opponent "Good luck."


"You as well. I'm just happy to be here!" said Chapman with a smile.


Nguyen opened [Doomed Traveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomed+Traveler) , and [Civilized Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civilized+Scholar) – but Chapman had a [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) to stop Nguyen from ripping through his deck, or getting in any good attacks with [Homicidal Brute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homicidal+Brute) .


Unfortunately for Chapman, that [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) was the only card he drew that could deal with opposing creatures – and he soon found himself getting pummeled by a [Stitched Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) , equipped with an [Avacyn's Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Collar) .


Chapman struggled to grind his way into the game with a [Moorland Haunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moorland+Haunt) , and a [Niblis of the Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niblis+of+the+Mist) – but his efforts were for naught as Nguyen had a [Feeling of Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread) to take the first game.

*Ashton Chapman*

Tuan Nguyen 1 – Ashton Chapman 0


### Game 2


Both players kept their opening hands in Game Two, but Nguyen found himself stuck on two lands for several turns.


By the time Nguyen found his third land, it was too late – as Chapman had a [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) , a [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) , and an [Urgent Exorcism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urgent+Exorcism) to ensure that his early creatures were able to take out Nguyen.


Tuan Nguyen 1 – Ashton Chapman 1

*Tuan Nguyen*

### Game 3


Chapman missed his second land drop, but he was still able to keep a smile on his face: "Oops! I thought I saw two lands when I kept my hand – I should have looked closer."


Nguyen had some mana troubles of his own, but they were nothing compared to Chapman's –and Nguyen was eventually able to fly to a 10-0 record with a [Drogskol Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Captain) , and an army of spirits backed up by [Feeling of Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread) .


Tuan Nguyen 2 – Ashton Chapman 1


 

Round 11: Feature Match - Owen Turtenwald vs. Craig Wesco
---------------------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett* 

Undefeated Craig Wescoe sat down to play [Channel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel) [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) 's Owen Turtenwald at 9-1. The two probably had the best decks in the top pod. Turtenwald had a mean blue-black control machine topped by [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) , while Wescoe's green-white beatdown deck sported a whopping FIVE [Travel Preparations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations) .


Wescoe quickly sent back his opening hand, and frowned when he saw his new six. He couldn't justify keeping it, and went to five.


Owen told a little story to pass the time. "My opponent last round was complaining about wishing people good luck. 'Who are these guys who wish people good luck and secretly want them to mulligan and get manascrewed?' Of course, then he mulliganed to five and lost. I told him it was karma."



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsea12/fm11%20Match.JPG)

Wescoe stayed at five and they were off. His early [Silverchase Fox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverchase+Fox) was held off by a turn-two [Typhoid Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Typhoid+Rats) from Turtenwald. Wescoe skipped a land drop, but then made a few more without adding to the board. Meanwhile Turtenwald had dug with [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) and and was content to play lands and sit on his mana. Wescoe played his fifth land and tapped out for [Angelic Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Overseer) .


"This is dirty," said Turtenwald, tapping three for [Frightful Delusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightful+Delusion) . Wescoe broke out laughing, "WHAAAAAAMMY!"


Turtenwald continued to churn through his deck while Wescoe sat helpless. He flashed back [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) , then cast [Tower Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Geist) putting [Reap the Seagraf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+the+Seagraf) into the graveyard. Wescoe mainphased [Moment of Heroism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment+of+Heroism) to set up [Prey Upon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) on [Tower Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Geist) , but Turtenwald had [Undying Evil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Evil) . How many cards he was up over the course of the match is left as an exercise to the reader.


Turtenwald hit for three and summoned [Murder of Crows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder+of+Crows) . Wescoe had [Smite the Monstrous](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite+the+Monstrous) for it on his turn. Turtenwald flashed back [Reap the Seagraf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+the+Seagraf) and began the business of killing Wescoe. All Wescoe could manage was a Festerhide boar, saying "This draw's been pretty Boar-ing" with a grin. [Grasp of Phantoms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms) from Turtenwald made the rest of the match academic.


Turtenwald 1 - Wescoe 0


### Game 2


While they shuffled they talked about the draft and how they had managed to stay out of each other's way. [Scorned Villager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorned+Villager) from Wescoe had given Turtenwald the heads-up to stay away from green, and he figured Wescoe would pair it with either red or white.


Wescoe kicked off with a [Scorned Villager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorned+Villager) , and Turtenwald bought himself some time with a [Silent Departure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) . Wescoe gamely replayed it the following turn. Turtenwald drew, played a third land, and passed with a scowl. Wescoe's werewolf flipped, giving him scads of mana. He summoned [Somberwald Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somberwald+Dryad) , then [Silverchase Fox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverchase+Fox) . With a shrug, Turtenwald [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) d it. Wescoe made him pay with a [Travel Preparations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations) , and hit for three.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsea12/fm11%20Turtenwald.JPG)
*Owen Turtenwald*

Turtenwald cast [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) on his mainphase, binning [Ghoulraiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghoulraiser) , [Screeching Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Skaab) and [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) . Wescoe continued to pile on the pain, attacking with his two creatures and adding [Briarpack Alpha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarpack+Alpha) to make it eight damage.


Turtenwald paused on his turn, then flashed back [Silent Departure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) on the [Somberwald Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somberwald+Dryad) . Wescoe flashed back his Preparations on his two remaining creatures and smashed. Wescoe had [Evil Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Twin) to copy [Briarpack Alpha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarpack+Alpha) , but Wescoe had more gas in the tank, including another [Travel Preparations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations) , and took the game handily.


Turtenwald 1 - Wescoe 1


### Game 3


Turtenwald led out with [Screeching Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Skaab) , getting [Reap the Seagraf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+the+Seagraf) into his graveyard. wescoe made a [Dawntreader Elk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawntreader+Elk) . Turtenwald played his third land and passed. Wescoe played his third forest and held back. Turtenwald played [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) at end of turn, then swung in with his Skaab. Wescoe blocked and sacrified to fetch a plains, and Turtenwald slammed down [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) , hoping to run away with things.


Not so. Wescoe was ready with [Crush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush) ing vines on his turn. Of course, he had no offense to speak of. Turtenwald hit and flashed back [Reap the Seagraf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+the+Seagraf) . Finally Wescoe got on the board with [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers) . Turtenwald flipped the script on that with an [Evil Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Twin) and a [Silent Departure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) . His attack brought Wescoe to fourteen and he played [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) .


Wescoe was forced to spend a [Travel Preparations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations) and [Smite the Monstrous](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite+the+Monstrous) to get rid of Turtenwald's mock Cagebreakers. Turtenwald hit again. Wescoe was running out of time. He passed without playing anything, buying himself a turn when Turtenwald had to avoid attacking into the obvious [Briarpack Alpha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarpack+Alpha) . Wescoe played it at the end of turn, then re-enlisted his Cagebreakers.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsea12/fm11%20Wescoe.JPG)
*Craig Wesco*

If Turtenwald hadn't been in the driver's seat before, a [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) flipping his [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) certainly put him there. He flashed back [Silent Departure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) on the Cagebreakers and dropped Wescoe to just six life. Wescoe's board couldn't answer the flier, and with [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) in Turtenwald's hand it was long odds to escape. He gamely played it out, but could not avoid defeat.


"Yeah, flipping off [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) - pretty gross," said Turtenwald


Afterward they compared decks, and Turtenwald admitted he'd needed the good fortune to beat Wescoe's beatdown machine. They wished each other good luck in the final round of the first draft.


Owen Turtenwald defeats Craig Wescoe 2-1


 

Sunday, 1:35 p.m.: Quick Questions - What Innistrad card has changed in desirability the most for draft, now that Dark Ascension is out?

|  |  |
| Craig Wescoe: *" [Doomed Traveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomed+Traveler) . Really all the white creatures that give you value when they die.

It's so much better now, especially with [Screeching Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Skaab) , who trades off where [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) would just sit there. "* |

Sunday, 3:20 p.m.: Deck Tech - Blue-Green Mill Yourself with Sam Black
----------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Steve Sadin* 

When *Dark Ascension* hit stores a few weeks ago, many top players proclaimed that graveyard based strategies, such as [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) , and Blue-Green Mill Yourself were no longer viable.


Sam Black listened to these public declarations, but they didn't sway him. In fact, the lack of support for Blue-Green Mill Yourself further encouraged Sam to look for opportunities to draft the deck.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsea12/draftinwithSamDeck.JPG)

And in the first draft at Grand Prix Seattle-Tacoma, Sam Black did just that.


"I first picked [Niblis of the Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niblis+of+the+Breath) over [Death's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Caress) , and [Skirsdag Flayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirsdag+Flayer) . Then I took [Dawntreader Elk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawntreader+Elk) (when there was a [Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tracker) 's Instincts that I was pretty sure I was going to be able to table) over [Death's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Caress) – then I third picked a [Screeching Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Skaab) over some other good black spells. I got a very late [Feed the Pack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feed+the+Pack) , and I tabled the [Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tracker) 's Instincts as expected."


The rest of the draft went well, and Sam put together a powerful Blue-Green Mill Yourself deck that he ultimately piloted to a 2-1 record.

47 Cards 




![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forest)


















When asked what it takes to make the deck work, Sam explained that the deck needs a lot of different pieces (in the right proportions) if it's going to win.


"The most important thing for the deck are the enablers. You need four plus solid early enablers like [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch) , [Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tracker) 's Instincts, [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) , [Screeching Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Skaab) , and [Thought Scour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Scour) ."


And once you have the requisite ways to put cards into your graveyard, you're going to have to fill up your deck with a bunch of creatures.


"For starters, you need at least 14 creatures. And you want a good curve full of things that can trade early, since you really want to have creatures in the graveyard for things like [Gnaw to the Bone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnaw+to+the+Bone) . However, that last part can be pretty tough since a lot of your early creatures are cards like [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) that rarely die – which is why I go out of my way to draft cards like [Dawntreader Elk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawntreader+Elk) , and [Screeching Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Skaab) ."


So you've got your creatures and your graveyard enablers, what next?


"The deck has to do a lot of different things well. The deck needs fliers not for their offensive capabilities, but so you don't just die in the air to opposing [Chapel Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist) s, and the like. "


"You also need [Gnaw to the Bone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnaw+to+the+Bone) , [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning) , or a bunch of good aggressive creatures like [Stitched Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) to help you catch up if you fall behind early. If the [Gnaw to the Bone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnaw+to+the+Bone) (or, alternatively, a [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning) ) hadn't been opened, I don't think I would have been able to win any of my matches."


But that's not all.


"Once you have that all taken care of, you still have to make sure that your end game is powerful enough that you can reliably win once you've milled away most of your library."

*Smiling Sam Black*

But Sam doesn't stop once he's picked up all the necessary pieces for his own deck. Sam also goes out of his way to take cards that would be particularly effective against him out of the draft.


"I made it a point to take cards that would have been really good against my deck, particularly when I could play them myself. [Somberwald Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somberwald+Dryad) , and [Undead Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Alchemist) might not have been the best cards in my deck – but they would have been really tough for me to beat, so I didn't hesitate to take them."


When asked if he had to make any particularly tough picks in the draft, Sam had a specific choice in mind.


"My hardest pick was [Selhoff Occultist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selhoff+Occultist) versus [One-Eyed Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow) – and I ultimately went with the [Selhoff Occultist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selhoff+Occultist) , which really hurt me in the match against Blue-White that I lost. I should really just stop passing [One-Eyed Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow) ..."


I was pretty surprised by this, so I asked Sam to elaborate.


"There are a ton of cards that make 1/1 flying spirit tokens, and [One-Eyed Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow) just blanks all of them. Plus, Blue-White Fliers is the best deck in the format by a significant margin, and [One-Eyed Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow) is the best card against them."


"It's tricky with decks like this one where all of your cards are so synergy dependent, so you need a lot of enablers -- but I still should have taken the [One-Eyed Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow) . [Niblis of the Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niblis+of+the+Breath) plus [Murder of Crows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder+of+Crows) just isn't enough flying defense. I should have taken the [Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrow) , and I definitely should have played the [Battleground Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist) maindeck."


Before we left, Sam explained that he had some regrets about the way he had constructed his deck.


"After playing with the deck for three rounds, I think I misbuilt it," said Sam while pointing towards the Memory's Journey, and the [Runic Repetition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runic+Repetition) that was in his deck.


"My deck has so much power that I'm going to win the game before I would deck myself -- so I should have just had more giant smashers like [Hollowhenge Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollowhenge+Beast) , and [Battleground Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist) ."


"It's possible that I should have played a [Wreath of Geists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wreath+of+Geists) main – but it's too easy to get blown out by cards like [Bonds of Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonds+of+Faith) , or [Victim of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victim+of+Night) . I really should have just played more of my big guys."


There are a lot of people out there who will tell you that Blue-Green doesn't have the tools to win right now. But if you, like Sam Black, are willing to go against the grain – you just mind find yourself with an excellent deck full of [Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tracker) 's Instincts, and [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm) s!


 

Round 13: Feature Match - Sameer Merchant vs. Dillon Winter
-----------------------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett* 

Interest in thirteen-year-old Dillon Winter was sparked when legendary [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) Chris Pikula snapped a photo of him drafting beside Jon Finkel on Day 2, pointing out that Finkel has a Pro Tour Top 8 for each year Winter has been alive. Now he's at 10-2 and fighting for Top 8. In his way was Sameer Merchant, piloting an Esper deck packed with card draw and heavy hitters like [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) .


### Game 1


Winter won the roll and chose to play. They started slow, with the first play being Winter's [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) on turn three. It milled away three land and [Reap the Seagraf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+the+Seagraf) . Merchant cast [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) up to eight cards, and discarded [Stitcher's Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitcher%27s+Apprentice) . Winter played [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) and upsized his Skaab with [Diregraf Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Captain) .


Merchant tapped out for [One-Eyed Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow) and [Blazing Torch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Torch) . Winter flashed back [Reap the Seagraf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+the+Seagraf) . Merchant wasted no time throwing [Blazing Torch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Torch) at the Captain, then summoned [Makeshift Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler) . [Grasp of Phantoms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms) from Winter put that on the back burner for a while, and he attacked for three.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsea12/r13match.JPG)

Merchant untapped and upgraded to [Angel of Flight Alabaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Flight+Alabaster) . Winter thought hard for his next play, then settled on a second [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) (milling [Geralf's Messenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger) , [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) and land) and [Manor Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manor+Skeleton) . Merchant swung overhead for four and stocked up with another [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) . Still no sixth land, but he did add a [Black Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat) to the table.


Winter took care of the Angel with a one-two punch of [Corpse Lunge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Lunge) exiling [Diregraf Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Captain) and [Dead Weight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight) , but his rag-tag unenhanced zombies weren't threatening. Merchant had a grip of goodies. He threw down [Stormbound Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbound+Geist) and [Markov Patrician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Patrician) , overshadowing Winter's next plays of [Highborn Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highborn+Ghoul) and [Black Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat) . Merchant hit for two and finally got his [Makeshift Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler) back into play. The Geist hit again, and Winter ambushed it with [Nephalia Seakite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Seakite) . Merchant resolved the undying trigger.


Winter drew and passed back. It was a snarled board. While Winter surveyed, Merchant realised they'd made a mistake, forgetting the [Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrow) 's effect. The [Stormbound Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbound+Geist) should've lived. A Judge was called and the game state was quickly rectified.


Merchant sent his [Markov Patrician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Patrician) in, clearly as a sacrificial lamb. Winter blocked with [Manor Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manor+Skeleton) and regenerated. Down came [Morkrut Banshee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morkrut+Banshee) , clearing off the [Nephalia Seakite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Seakite) . Winter milled Merchant for three and played out [Battleground Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist) . The [Nephalia Drownyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nephalia%2BDrownyard) was looking like Winter's best path out of this mess.


Merchant helped that plan along with [Tower Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Geist) , and then played [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) . He forced the last card out of Winter's hand, an uncastable [Back from the Brink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+from+the+Brink) . So it went for a couple turns, Winter milling and Merchant ticking up his Liliana. He got her to six, but had only four cards left in his library. When Winter milled him in response to Liliana's ulitmate ability, Merchant conceded.


Winter 1 - Merchant 0


### Game 2


Merchant went on the aggressive for game two, opening with [Black Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat) and [Markov Patrician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Patrician) . Winter had [Dead Weight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight) to dispatch the vampire, but Merchant restocked with [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) . Winter passed on four mana and flashed in a [Nephalia Seakite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Seakite) , but Merchant went over the top with [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) .

*Sameer Merchant*

[Manor Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manor+Skeleton) wasn't exactly the rejoinder that Winter needed. Meanwhile, Merchant was long on power, following up with [Angel of Flight Alabaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Flight+Alabaster) . He couldn't grab his 2/2 flying vampire tokens soon enough. Winter played [Battleground Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battleground+Geist) . Merchant grew his vampire army, then cast [Stormbound Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbound+Geist) and [Blazing Torch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Torch) . Things were getting worse for Winter and [Reap the Seagraf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+the+Seagraf) wasn't helping matters.


Merchant suicided his [Stormbound Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbound+Geist) in, finishing off Seakite with the Torch, then used [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) to get rid of [Stormbound Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbound+Geist) . The silver lining for Winter was that his [Corpse Lunge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Lunge) was online to kill [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) , but he still couldn't handle Merchant's fliers. In two short attacks, it was over.


Winter 1 - Merchant 1


### Game 3


Winter mulliganed to six for the decider. Merchant stayed on seven. Winter played out lands and Merchant fixed his mana with Evolving wilds. Winter passed his third turn without a play and watched as Merchant cast [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) , discarding island down to seven.


Winter played [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) and an [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) , milling [Diregraf Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Captain) , [Black Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat) , land and a second [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) . Once again, [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) joined the fray on Merchant's side.


Winter kept it off the board for a turn with [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) and got in for one. Merchant replayed it and passed. A sixth mana for Winter let him cast [Back from the Brink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+from+the+Brink) . Merchant cluttered the board with [Markov Patrician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Patrician) and One-Eyed [Scar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scar) crow, and got his vampire tokens ready.

*Dillon Winter*

Winter got [Diregraf Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Captain) [Back from the Brink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+from+the+Brink) and added [Stitched Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) , but [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) was churning out tokens. [Dead Weight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight) got the makeshift Captain off the table and [Chant of the Skifsang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chant+of+the+Skifsang) defanged the [Stitched Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stitched+Drake) . Winter got to restock his graveyard by getting a token [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) , but before long Merchant was flipping into [Lord of Lineage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Lineage) , and that's funny for only one person at the table.


Time was called on the match, but the result wasn't in doubt. The supercharged vampire army flew over for victory in just two swings, and Winter extended the hand.


Sameer Merchant defeats Dillon Winter 2-1

Sunday, 5:40 p.m.: Drafting with Jon Finkel
-------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett* 

Living Legend Jon Finkel 3-0'd his first draft of the day (though not with ease, he says) and sat down looking for a repeat to earn himself a spot in the Top 8.


His first pick was easy - [Flayer of the Hatebound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+of+the+Hatebound) , a card he rates quite highly. The second was significantly more contentious - [Drogskol Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Captain) over [Wrack with Madness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrack+with+Madness) . He said that too often people feel locked in by their first pick.


"I like to make high-variance picks like that. [Drogskol Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Captain) is so good, and with a card like that getting passed, you have to think more is coming. I'd much rather take a card completely out of my colors if it means having a chance at an incredible deck."


Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. Only the red cards kept coming, and he wound up with a bunch of aggressive creatures and a pair of [Faithless Looting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) . Finkel said he rates the Looting quite highly.


He got to reaffirm his color choice to the table with [Kruin Outlaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kruin+Outlaw) to start pack two, but still hadn't settled on a second color. Third pick he saw [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) and set his sights on tabling it, taking [Skirsdag Cultist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirsdag+Cultist) instead. A fourth pick [Skirsdag High Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirsdag+High+Priest) nudged him toward black, and he picked up two [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) s late. He was hoping a [Bump in the Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bump+in+the+Night) would get back to him as well, but it was not to be.


"I was pretty sure the [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) would wheel, and the Cultist is just too good to pass up. I'm playing both of the [Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeance) s but I only have the five flashback spells. At least with the Lootings I'll be seeing a lot of my deck."


The third pack was unexciting for Finkel, with no standout red or black cards save for a [Brimstone Volley](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimstone+Volley) and a [Geistflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame) . There were also strange late blue signals, like a sixth pick [Silent Departure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure) . Finkel had passed on a late [Dream Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Twist) in pack two, taking a [Brain Weevil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Weevil) instead, a card he knew he might have to play. As it stood, he had to dance with who brought him, having more black than useful blue.


He wasn't thrilled with his deck. "I mean, I'm playing [Sightless Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sightless+Ghoul) . I hate that guy, but with Cultist and [Altar's Reap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Reap) he's barely good enough. It's going to be a tough one. I'm not playing [Torch Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Fiend) , but maybe I should."

Round 14: Feature Match - Ben Stark vs. Michael Jacob
-----------------------------------------------------

When you ask members of the pro community to name the best limited players in the world, Ben Stark's name inevitably comes up. And with good reason. The Pro Tour Paris Champion has found himself at, or near, the top of the standings at just about every limited tournament he's played in over the last three years.

The cerebral Michael Jacob might not have quite the resume that Ben Stark has – but he's still one of the most fearsome players on the Pro Tour. With a Top 8 at Pro Tour Amsterdam in 2010, and four Grand Prix Top 8s under his belt, Michael Jacob is not someone that you want to face with a Top 8 on the line.


### Game 1


Michael Jacob won the roll, and opened on a [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) that immediately transformed into an [Insectile Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) thanks to [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) .


Stark never drew an answer for Jacob's 3/2 flier, and died to it a few turns later.

### Game 2


Jacob started game two with a [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) , and once again transformed it immediately – but this time Stark had a [Victim of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victim+of+Night) to deal with the [Insectile Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) .


Jacob then found himself stuck on two lands, while Stark built up his board with a [Tormented Pariah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Pariah) , and a [Pitchburn Devils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchburn+Devils) .


By the time Jacob had drawn his third land, it was too late – as Stark was able to burn him out with a [Bump in the Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bump+in+the+Night) , and a [Brimstone Volley](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimstone+Volley) .

### Game 3


Jacob didn't have a [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) to start the third game, nor did he have a fourth land – and consequently found himself backpedalling for much of the game.


By the time Jacob had dealt with Stark's initial wave of creatures, Stark had a [Vengeful Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Vampire) , and two [Bump in the Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bump+in+the+Night) s to finish off Michael Jacob, and move to 12-2 in the tournament.
