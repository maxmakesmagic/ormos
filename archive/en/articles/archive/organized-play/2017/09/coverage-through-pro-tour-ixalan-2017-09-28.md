The 2017 *Magic* World Championship!
====================================


October starts off with the most important *Magic* tournament of the year: the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship. 24 of the world's very best competitors as well as the two best teams of the 2016–17 season will face off in Boston, Massachusetts, October 6–8. On top of that, it will be the debut of *Ixalan* Standard on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic), making this one weekend you won't want to miss if you're looking to see the fresh format in action!

While *Ixalan* will have been a few weeks old by this point, it's likely the already well-received Limited format will have uncharted territory left to explore, and we'll get a look into that during this weekend with a sweet coverage crew and even sweeter 40-card action.


Pro Tour *Ixalan*
=================


Taking place in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the weekend of November 3–5, this Pro Tour marks the first time in a long time that the Pro Tour will be taking place more than a month after the debut of a big Standard release, and it will be our chance to see how pro players approach the Limited and Standard formats after they have begun to already develop.


**Live Video on**: [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)  
**Start Times**: All three days at 9 a.m. local time (MT)/8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET/3 p.m. UTC  
**Play-by-Play Commentators**: Marshall Sutcliffe, Riley Knight, and Tim Willoughby

**Interviewer and Features**: Brian David-Marshall  
**News Desk**: Rich Hagon and Maria Bartholdi

**Writer-Reporters**: Marc Calderaro and Corbin Hosler  
**Social Media**: Nate Price and Chris Peeler

Pro Tour *Ixalan* marks a chance to see not what the top players build, but how they adapt to an already-established metagame. We're also excited to have Simon Görtzen, Pro Tour Champion and all-star color commentator from Europe's Grand Prix scene, at this tournament!


This Pro Tour also marks the beginning of the 2017–18 Pro Tour Team Series, where we'll see this season's teams in action for the very first time. Teams will be revealed in the weeks leading up to this Pro Tour, [and applications are due by October 6](http://media.wizards.com/2017/downloads/2017-18_Team_Series_Eligibility_and_Rules.pdf), so we'll begin to see who emerges on which team very soon!


In Other News: GP Singapore Weekend Shifts Later
================================================


In other important news, Grand Prix Singapore next year—originally scheduled for June 8–10, 2018—is moving to the weekend of June 22–24. The decision to move was due to circumstances that were out of the control of ChannelFireball Events, the organizer for GPs next year. The format for GP Singapore main event will remain as Standard Constructed, matching the format for GP Pittsburgh, which also takes place that same weekend.


On that note, update your calendars accordingly. We'll be getting the word out on social media platforms today specifically regarding this news, but be sure to let your friends know if they were planning to go!
