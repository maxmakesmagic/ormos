Hello and welcome to Flashback Week! Today, I'm going to show you my latest [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) deck.

Last week, a lot of readers were upset about the difficulty of acquiring some of the cards in my Modern [Heartless Summoning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Summoning) deck. This week, I'm going to make sure the deck I write about is especially easy to acquire.

Standard has changed into an extremely aggressive format. Decks like Illusions and [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) seem to be the industry standard these days. Slower, more powerful strategies like [Wolf Run](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run) variants are falling out of favor because of their questionable matchups against decks like Illusions.

Aggressive decks might seem like the best choice in Standard. This brings us to the next question: What deck beats the aggressive decks in Standard?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab173_burning.jpg)[Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) | Art by [Raymond Swanland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Raymond+Swanland%22%5D)

[Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) is about as good as it gets against aggressive decks. The deck has the ability to play board-sweeping effects alongside tons of spot removal while playing the most effective card-advantage engines in the format (except for [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) and [Garruk, Primal Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter)).

![Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Burning+Vengeance)  
[Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) does a lot here. It becomes very hard to lose to aggressive creature strategies when you untap with a [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) on the battlefield. The ability to kill creatures and draw cards on a whim will make your Illusions opponents have little to no chance.

[Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) has become the industry-standard counterspell. We definitely want four [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s in our list. [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) helps us beat the decks that want to go bigger. The deck has enough cheap card draw and spot removal to minimize the potential tempo loss associated with leaving mana for countermagic open instead of casting a sorcery.

![Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mana+Leak)  
[Geistflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame) is awesome these days. It's going to be a two-for-one more often than not against the most aggressive decks in the format. If you play a [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) before flashing it back then it could be worth a full three cards. [Violent Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Ultimatum), anyone?

![Geistflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Geistflame)  
[Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) is another excellent counterspell for the format. It's important that we're able to go up to ten counterspells after sideboarding against [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) decks.

![Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dissipate)  
[Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) gives the deck a whole new angle of attacking. The Phoenix makes it difficult for opposing players to put pressure on you with [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) and [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), but it also functions as an excellent win condition here. The synergy of having [Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) and [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) in the same deck is also quite nice.

![Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix)  
[Chandra, the Firebrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+the+Firebrand) is all kinds of awesome. I like having one copy of her because the singleton increases the value of our Phoenixes by so much. [Chandra, the Firebrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+the+Firebrand) is a mythic rare, though, and I understand that it might be difficult to acquire for some. I'd replace her with a copy of [Devil's Play](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devil%27s+Play) if you're unable to find a copy of the ***Magic** 2012* mythic rare.

![Chandra, the Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chandra%2C+the+Firebrand)  
[Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) is proving itself to be one of the strongest cards in *Innistrad* and is a pure upgrade from [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) for decks that can cast it. The power of [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) increases significantly when you consider the amount of flashback present in the deck. Again, [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) not only works well with you flashback spells, but it makes your Phoenixes better than they already are. I like to hold my [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) a bit against non-aggro decks, whereascards like [Slagstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm), [Rolling Temblor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor), and [Geistflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistflame) are all suspect against the slower decks of the format. If you wait until you have a few of these cards in hand, you can turn [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) into a card with [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) levels of card quality and advantage.

![Desperate Ravings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Desperate+Ravings)  
[Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) might not be as good as [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings), but it's still pretty awesome. [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) and [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) help this deck play draw-go successfully, even against the most dedicated control opponents.

![Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Think+Twice)  
[Slagstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm) is the best board sweeper available to us. Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to cast if we're not playing rare lands. As a result, I've chosen to play one [Slagstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm) and two [Rolling Temblor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor) to give us a greater chance of being able to wipe the board on the third turn. If you're able to get your hands on a playset of [Sulfur Falls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Falls) then I would replace the one-of [Rolling Temblor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor) with a third copy of [Slagstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm).

![Slagstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Slagstorm)  
The sideboard helps the deck compete with some of the slower decks of the format. [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) is a necessary piece of any blue sideboard in today's metagame. Post-sideboard we go up to eleven counterspells against [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) decks.

[Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) is difficult to acquire. Unfortunately, it's necessary as long as [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) is legal in Standard. The [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) deck has no way to beat a Thrun besides [Phantasmal Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image).

![Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phantasmal+Image)  
[Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) makes the Solar Flare and Blue-Black Control matchups A LOT better. In fact, a turn-two Shrine is just about good game against Blue-Black. The [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) deck has enough countermagic, card draw, and burn to end the game with a Shrine before the blue-black deck can get its footing.

![Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage)  
[Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) is necessary against red decks and their Shrines, but it also shines against [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).

![Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ancient+Grudge)  
I also included a singleton of [Rolling Temblor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Temblor) in the board to side in against Illusions and Humans.

![Rolling Temblor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rolling+Temblor)  
Once we put it all together the deck looks like this:

I played a few matches with the deck that I'd like to share with you.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab173_match1Header.jpg)

My opponent played a sixth land and tried a [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine), which I [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed. I ticked my Shrine up to eight, drew [Silent Departure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Departure), cast Chandra, putting the Shrine at nine, and ticked up the Chandra, then returned both [Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix)es to my hand and passed the turn. My opponent went for another [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) and passed the turn. I cast [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) from the graveyard, ticked the Shrine to ten, drew [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) and [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), and discarded [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance). Then I drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), cast [Chandra's Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) putting the Shrine at twelve, and attacked with both Phoenixes. Finally, I used Chandra's –2 ability, cast a copied [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) targeting my opponent, and popped the Shrine for the win.

[Shrine of Burning Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) is basically a turn-two win against Blue-Black Control.

I hope you all enjoyed my budget friendly version of [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance).
