*What's your favorite **Magic** 2012 Limited deck you've put together (or seen) so far? What was in it, and what did you like about it?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_daveguskin.jpg)**Dave Guskin:** My favorite Limited deck from ***Magic** 2012* is definitely the green-blue deck I had in a recent draft. You may not realize, but in development, we tend to think pretty deeply about how each of the color pairs will play together. So, for example, white-blue in a core set is generally a bunch of good flyers and ground-stall, and for M12, black-red was an aggressive bloodthirst deck with the tag-team of enablers in [Goblin Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger) and [Tormented Soul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul). Green-blue isn't the most common color combination for a player to draft, but it too has its enablers. What goes best with [Vastwood Gorger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vastwood+Gorger) and [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) (other than the already excellent green mana ramp of [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth))? [Chasm Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chasm+Drake) and [Levitation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Levitation), of course!

| Chasm Drake | Levitation |

To the skies!

My deck went an undefeated 3-0, with nary a rare in sight. After the "combo" of Drake and [Levitation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Levitation) for the numerous fatty-boom-booms in my deck, the next best card was almost certainly [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept). In green-blue, with no true removal, you often have to play a tempo game... and no card serves that role better than [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept). The Adept's power level in ***Magic** 2012* might even be higher than it was in ***Magic** 2011*, due to its uncanny ability to stop bloodthirsty creatures across the table.

So yeah, the next time you feel "forced" into a "bad" color combination, think about the late-pick enablers for your deck and you might be surprised!
