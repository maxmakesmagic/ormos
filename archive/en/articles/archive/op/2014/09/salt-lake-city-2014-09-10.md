September 10, 2014
 










The month of September is a busy one in the world of *Magic*. It marks a major shift in the Standard format, a farewell to one block, and a warm welcome to another. *Khans of Tarkir* is the talk of many as we're into the second week of previews here on DailyMTG.com, and many players are beginning to look at [the new cards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ktk-cig-en) and evaluate where Standard will fall with the rotation of *Magic 2014* and *Return to Ravnica*.


In the meantime, however, some players are still focused on the present, and while many are gearing up for the new set and the Prerelease, others had different events in mind.


Looking Back
============


While many players are excited to delve into the new set (and block), 878 players took their dive into *Magic 2015*'s last premier play hurrah in [Salt Lake City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpslc14) last weekend.


To the surprise of very few, white proved to be the dominant color of the weekend throughout both the Sealed as well as Draft rounds. [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) was lauded as the best card in the set, although frontline common [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) and other solid staples such as [Sungrace Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sungrace+Pegasus) and [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) were also represented. White's power level was a known factor going in, and players looked to either play the color or run cards that were particularly good against it—such as black's [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom).

Along the weekend, through fifteen rounds of Sealed and Draft, many interesting strategies emerged. Some players opted for [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact) strategies in Draft. Others passed on-color Souls for [Illusory Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Angel)s. And by the time the Top 8 emerged, both 13th-ranked Paul Rietzl and 17th-ranked Eric Froehlich found themselves playing for the trophy at the end of the day. GP Salt Lake City marked Rietzl's tenth Grand Prix Top 8, while it was Grand Prix Top 8 number twelve for Froehlich.


However, neither of them would claim it. The trophy ultimately went to a longtime player Brandon Nelson. The Grand Prix regular from St. Paul, Minnesota, has maintained a stellar career win rate at Grand Prix, winning 65.9% of his GP matches going into the last Pro Tour, but only had one GP Top 8 to show for it before last weekend. No more. Nelson's hard work and consistency finally earned him a second Grand Prix Top 8, along with the title at Salt Lake City.

While [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing) broadcasted all the action from Utah last weekend, coverage reporters Adam Styborski and Marc Calderaro delivered the latest stories, deck techs, draft reports, and feature matches from the show floor. Full coverage of the event can be [found here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpslc14/draftwilson), but here are a couple of key highlights:



[Deck Tech with Jacob Wilson](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpslc14/draftwilson)—Marc Calderaro got a chance to catch up with 15th-ranked player Jacob Wilson to see how his second draft went. Wilson's response? "Well, I passed an on-color Soul." Take a look at how his blue-red draft, featuring multiple copies of [Illusory Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Angel), turned out in his draft report.


[Drafting with Paul Rietzl](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpslc14/draftrietzl)—Adam Styborski goes beyond a simple draft tech with 13th-ranked Paul Rietzl. He also discusses what has changed in the *Magic 2015* Limited environment from release up to last weekend. How do things change, whether it be color preferences, pick orders, or general card evaluations? Styborski delivers all of Rietzl's answers in his in-depth draft coverage.


[When White Makes Right](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpslc14/white)—Marc Calderaro catches up with Paul Rietzl, 2nd-ranked player Owen Turtenwald, Ben Seck, andMagic 2015 Limited: white. From there, they discuss the values of moving in despite the possibility of white being over-drafted, the playability of cards like [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom) in a player's main deck, and whether the under-represented color archetypes are even worth it.


Going Forward
=============


This weekend, be sure to catch live coverage of the 2014 *Magic Online* Community Cup, as this year's Community Team comes to Wizards of the Coast headquarters in an effort to keep the trophy for themselves. Meanwhile, Team Wizards aims to get their clutches on the Community Cup trophy, after what is undoubtedly going to be a gruesome marring of the Community Team fun and exciting three days of *Magic*. You'll be able to catch coverage of all the action on the [*Magic*](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) [Twitch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twitch) channel starting Friday.
