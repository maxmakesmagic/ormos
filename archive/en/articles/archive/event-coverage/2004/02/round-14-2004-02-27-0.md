Masashiro Kuroda vs. Gabriel Nassif
-----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r14fm2_2.jpg)Nassif has quietly become one of the most consistent players on the Pro Tour, with top finishes in Pro Tours, Grand Prix, and even a finals appearance in the last Masters. He had a Top 8 this season at New Orleans, and is looking to get another today. His opponent this round is Masashiro Kuroda, a top Japanese player who went undefeated yesterday. Unfortunately, Kuroda has had a trend in his career where he will go undefeated on day one of a major tournament, and then not do very well on the following today. Today, that trend has continued, as he is 2-3 on the day heading into this round. Unless he can return to yesterday's form, he'll have to deal with another event where he started off with a spectacular record but couldn't keep the momentum going.


### Game 1


Nassif mulliganed down to six. He played a [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and got a second with [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying), and then played a third with a grin that said, "Okay, I just drew this one and got a little lucky." He played [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), and [Barbed Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Lightning) went to the face on end step. Kuroda untapped, and summoned [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) was entwined, putting [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) and [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) into play. Kuroda had a second Simulacrum, and put both in front of the Colossus during Nassif's attack. After damage went on the stack, one was sacrificed to a [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast), dealing five to Nassif. Kuroda played an [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger), and on end step Nassif activated the Stone to clear the path for a fatal Colossus attack.


**Kuroda- 0 Nassif- 1**


### Game 2


Nassif found a second [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) with Scrying, and [Molten Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) destroyed the one in play. This stalled Nassif drastically, as he found himself stuck at two land. On end step [Pulse of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge) went to the dome, and Kuroda put some pressure on the table with [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger). Nassif found a third land and played [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), and Kuroda attacked with his Slogger and Nexus to deal five damage. A few shots and one attack later, the game was over.


**Kuroda- 1 Nassif- 1**


### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob04/r14fm2_1.jpg)Nassif mulliganed for the second time in the match, and after a great deal of thought, Kuroda mulliganed as well. Nassif played a [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and searched up another, leading to [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone). [Molten Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) destroyed a [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) as Nassif shook his head, once again stuck at two lands as he laughed. Kuroda had no problems, playing a Talisman and destroying the Stone with [Echoing Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin). Nassif eventually drew another [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) and played another Stone, while Kuroda had six lands and nothing else. [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) was cast to bring the [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) count up to three, bringing Nassif back into the game after it seemed he was convinced that he had lost. Once again, an [Echoing Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin) destroyed [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), and Nassif cast [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) to get a forest. With a shrug, he tapped all his lands and played [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel). It survived and attacked on the following turn, and Nassif added to his side with [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) to get a Colossus and a [Duplicant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicant) for insurance, playing the Colossus and Shaman from his hand. This was a position Kuroda couldn't get out of, and he conceded.


**Kuroda- 1 Nassif- 2**
