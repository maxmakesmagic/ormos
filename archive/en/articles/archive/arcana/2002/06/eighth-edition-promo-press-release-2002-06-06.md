### CALLING ALL MAGIC FANS

### WIZARDS OF THE COAST NEEDS YOU!

*Magic: The Gathering – Eighth Edition Seeks Fan Input*

June 5, 2002 (RENTON, Wash.) — The **Magic: The Gathering** team at Wizards of the Coast, Inc., is seeking player input, which will be incorporated into the release of the **Magic: The Gathering**-*Eighth Edition* set which is slated to release summer of 2003. 

In preparation for the release of *Eighth Edition*, Wizards of the Coast will be running a promotion on magicthegathering.com asking **Magic** fans for their input and feedback on many aspects of the set. The site will post weekly questions asking players to vote on which cards should be included in the set as well as asking them to decide on certain pieces of art that should be used in the set.

In addition, fans will be asked to submit and vote on flavor text submissions for cards that will be featured in the new set. For example: what should the flavor text be on [Aladdin's Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aladdin%27s+Ring) in *Eighth Edition*? The promotion will begin running on the magicthegathering.com site June 7 and will run through the beginning of September 2002.

“This is a great opportunity for the **Magic** community to play a role in the development of a new product, helping us create and put to market the best set possible,” said Joe Hauck, Vice President of Trading Card Games for Wizards of the Coast.

Wizards of the Coast, Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE:HAS), is the worldwide market share leader in the trading card game and tabletop roleplaying game categories. A leading developer and publisher of game-based entertainment products, as well as the owner and operator of one of the nation’s largest specialty game retail chains, the company holds an exclusive patent on the play mechanics of trading card games (TCGs) and produces the world’s best-selling **Pokémon** and **Magic: The Gathering** TCGs.
