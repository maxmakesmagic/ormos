 This is how Patrick Chapin summed up his focus for this tournament, although it honestly wasn't this tournament that captured his main focus.



"There is only the win."



 The winner of the Pro Tour gets an automatic invite to the World Championship in Nice, France later this year. Already a member of the **Magic** Hall of Fame, there is absolutely nothing Chapin wants more than to be the World Champion of **Magic**. With only 19 points, Chapin is a bit off pace to secure a regional or at-large invite.




 His opponent is Jamie Parke, a longtime East Coast **Magic** player from the NYC crew that spawned players like the legendary Jon Finkel. Parke has two Worlds Top 8s, including a finals appearance in Memphis 2008. Parke is also one of only a handful of players to have a Pro Tour Top 8 in each of the past three decades.






*Hall of Famer Patrick Chapin's goal from this Top 8 was a win to qualify for the World Championship. Jamie Park, on the other hand, was looking to cement his stay once again on the Pro Tour.*
