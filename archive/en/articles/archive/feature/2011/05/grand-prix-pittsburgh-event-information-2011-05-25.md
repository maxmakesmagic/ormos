![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2011.jpg)*Get your free promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).* For the first time since 2003, the Grand Prix circuit returns to Pittsburgh! The David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh, host of the past two Grand Prix events in Pittsburgh, will again play host to the Grand Prix. We’ll have events from casual to competitive all weekend long, and if you’re looking for a little fun outside of the venue, the David L. Lawrence Convention Center is located just minutes from the Strip District or Market Square.


 One amazing artist and one special spellslinger add to the activities at the Grand Prix. Pittsburgh’s own Christopher Moeller ([Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26591), [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte)) will be in attendance to meet fans and sign cards. Current **Magic: The Gathering**  Director of R&D and former Team CMU member and local-boy-turned-Wizards-employee Aaron Forsythe will be in town to spellsling and bring some Team CMU stories home with him.


 In addition to the promotional Maelstrom Pulse, the first 600 attendees who register will receive a playmat featuring art by Christopher Moeller. Additionally, players who participate in Public Events receive a "North American Grand Prix Tour" deck box (while supplies last). This box is the sixth in a series of eight being given away at North American Grand Prix in 2011. These deck boxes are customized with Steve Argyle art along one panel so that when all eight are collected and placed side by side, they create a full eight-piece mural.


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#1).*
