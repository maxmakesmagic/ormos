When this article publishes, we'll be less than 24 hours from the full reveal of the entire *Modern Masters 2015* *Edition* set. The [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/modernmasters2015edition) is getting pretty packed with sweet cards as it is, but be sure you check in tomorrow (Friday, May 8) for the full list.



While you're perusing the list, you'll notice that plenty of cards make tokens. Some cards even make plenty of tokens. In fact, *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* has a whopping 16 tokens. Some of the cards that make the tokens you'll see below have been previewed. Some have not.



What cards are yet to come? Guess away and find out tomorrow.
