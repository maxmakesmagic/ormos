Modern is a pretty big format, drawing its power from thirty-two different sets. Interestingly, the metagame contains decks that draw from all of those sets. Taking a look at some of the cards being played from each set, you get a sense of the breadth of the metagame, and of *Magic* as a whole, seen through the lens of this one format.
