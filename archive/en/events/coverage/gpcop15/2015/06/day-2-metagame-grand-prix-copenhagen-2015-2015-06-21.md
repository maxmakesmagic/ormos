The numbers are in. All 158 Day 2 decklists have been counted, checked, and categorized. Now we know what decks the more succesful people chose to compete with. You want to know too? Well, here it goes ...




| Deck | # | % |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Splinter Twin | 25 | 15.8 |
| Grixis Control | 12 | 7.6 |
| Affinity | 11 | 7.0 |
| Zoo | 10 | 6.3 |
| Tron | 10 | 6.3 |
| Abzan Midrange | 9 | 5.7 |
| Jund | 9 | 5.7 |
| Abzan Company | 8 | 5.1 |
| Burn | 8 | 5.1 |
| Amulet/Bloom | 7 | 4.4 |
| Goryo's Vengeance | 7 | 4.4 |
| Infect | 5 | 3.2 |
| Living End | 4 | 2.5 |
| Merfolk | 4 | 2.5 |
| Bogles | 3 | 1.9 |
| Death and Taxes | 3 | 1.9 |
| Grixis Delver | 3 | 1.9 |
| Scapeshift | 3 | 1.9 |
| Dredgevine | 2 | 1.3 |
| Jeskai Aggrocontrol | 2 | 1.3 |
| Jeskai Ascendancy | 2 | 1.3 |
| Abzan Aggro | 2 | 1.3 |
| White/Black Tokens | 2 | 1.3 |
| Others: | 8 | 5.1 |
| Total: | 158 | 100.0 |

As always, I have grouped similar decks together here. For example, take Splinter Twin. A full eleven of the decks in this category included a couple of black cards, and another four of them included [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). But calling one "Grixis Twin" and the other "TarmoTwin" and listing those separately wouldn't accurately reflect what was going on in the tournament. Which is: Splinter Twin was the most-played deck on Day 2 of this Grand Prix, by a solid margin even. However, with less than 16%, the deck was hardly dominating. If anything, the above shows the immense diversity of the Modern format.


Likewise, I have discounted a few minor splashes when compiling the numbers. For instance, one of the Black/White Token decks had a bit of blue, one Merfolk deck had a bit of white, and one of the Jeskai Aggrocontrol decks had a bit of black.


More interestingly, one of the Tron decks eschewed the regular green and red cards and was mono-blue instead. And of course, there was a lot of variety within the Zoo. Most of the Zoo players ran [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), a few didn't. Most stayed within the Naya colors, but one even made [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) the centerpiece of his deck.


Finally, the "Other" category held a few surprises. For example, there was a singleton Martyr of Sands deck here and a Death Cloud deck, but what turned the most heads was clearly the Four-Color Ghost Way deck. More on that later ...
