Known Issues List
-----------------






The following is a list of known issues on *Magic Online*. Our goal with the known issues list is to give players insight into what we're working on, as well as helping players avoid problematic bugs and performance issues.


Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of known issues; it simply contains the ones that we feel players are most likely to encounter. If you're curious behind the specific rationale of which issues are included, we talk a little bit more about it [here](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/139554007099/brandon-and-the-bug-blog#notes).


[REPORT A BUG](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-report-an-issue)




The *Magic Online* known issues list is divided up into several categories.


Client and Gameplay known issues are based around the client and broad mechanical interactions.

| Ongoing | Cards exiled by [Mind's Dilation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Dilation) may be incorrectly played at any time, rather than only at the resolution of the trigger. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | In rare cases, deleted binders continue to appear in the binders list. Collapsing and reopening the Binders section will remove deleted binders. | Trade |
| Ongoing | Abilities of objects that have changed color incorrectly display descriptive text indicating the changed color while on the stack | Duel Scene |

| Ongoing |  | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Players using the Disable Bluffing feature (commonly referred to by its keyboard shortcut F8) will automatically pass priority when all their lands are tapped, even if they have a card that can be cast for zero mana.

| Ongoing | The Added to your Collection window incorrectly displays product alphabetically instead of by rarity. | General |
| Ongoing | Player who get disconnected with an open chat window will find that every message in that window will appear to have been sent by the other player. | General |
| Ongoing | Chat histories are incorrectly not saved when chat windows are closed. | General |
| Ongoing | If a player controls two or more [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor)s, *Magic Online* will automatically stack all triggers from the Amulets together, rather than allowing players to choose how to stack their triggers.  | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | When a player casts [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra), its triggered ability will not reveal any cards or allow its controller to put a nonland permanent card onto the battlefield. | Cardset (Modern, Legacy, Cube) |
| Ongoing | Creature tokens with native abilities (for example, a Spirit token with flying) do not display that native ability when they temporarily gain an additional ability. This is a display issue only. Players can right-click or zoom in on a token to see all abilities it has. | Duel Scene |

| Ongoing | [Kira, Great-Glass Spinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kira%2C+Great-Glass+Spinner)'s ability does not grant the appropriate triggered ability. | Cardset (Cube, Modern) |
| Ongoing | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. | Cardset (Pauper) |
| Ongoing | If a token creature stops being blocked (perhaps because all blocking creatures were destroyed), it will return to a pile with other identical tokens if any are present. Once there, the game log is the only way to identify which creature was blocked. To identify this creature, players can point their cursor to the name of the token in the game log entry that identifies the attacking creatures and locate the creature that no longer has a blocking creature associated with it. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Some cards with the madness ability do not display the correct reminder text. Notably, this includes [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | If an opponent removes an Equipment from the battlefield with its equip ability on the stack targeting [Avacynian Missionaries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Missionaries), the [Missionaries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409743) will incorrectly transform at the end of the turn. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | If a player controls a [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) and plays the last card in their hand, if that card is a land with a replacement ability that allows that player to reveal a card (such as [Port Town](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Port+Town) or [Secluded Glen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Glen)), the [Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409997)'s triggered ability will put the Clue token onto the battlefield only after its controller passes priority. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Odric, Lunarch Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Lunarch+Marshal)'s triggered ability ignores the hexproof ability on a creature if it only has it temporarily. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | When some cards with madness are discarded, the triggered ability does not display the madness cost while on the stack. Players can find this information by right-clicking the card or by viewing the game log. | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | Abilities that trigger from a permanent becoming the target of a spell or ability (such as that of [Silverfur Partisan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)) are not triggered by copies of spells automatically put onto the stack. For example: if a player controls [Zada, Hedron Grinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zada%2C+Hedron+Grinder) and casts a spell on Zada, when Zada's triggered ability resolves, the player will be prompted to choose targets for the copies made by Zada. If the player chooses targets for the copies individually, [Silverfur Partisan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)'s ability will trigger correctly. If the player clicks OK to automatically choose the targets, the Partisan's ability won't trigger. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Fork in the Road](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork+in+the+Road) fails to display the destination zones of the chosen lands in the game log. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Infectious Curse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infectious+Curse) provides no indication as to which player has been cursed. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | If [Heir of Falkenrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+Falkenrath)’s ability is used to transform it into [Heir to the Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+to+the+Night), then it transforms back into [Heir of Falkenrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+Falkenrath) in the same turn in some way, its activated ability can be used again. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Ever After](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ever+After) resolves immediately upon selection of the second target instead of allowing the player to click a "Done" button. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [World Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Queller)’s triggered ability occasionally causes the game to restart.  | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | A player who clicks the Cancel button after sacrificing [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) during the mana ability window of casting a spell will be unable to proceed unless they can pay all costs with casting the spell. | Cardset (Modern, Pauper) |
| Ongoing | [Narset, Enlightened Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master)'s triggered ability does not allow players to cast split spells (such as [Fire & Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+%2F%2F+Ice)). | Cardset (Commander, Modern) |
| Ongoing | [Eldrazi Spawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Spawn) and Scions created by cards from the *Battle for Zendikar* and *Rise of the Eldrazi* sets display "Add {1} to your mana pool" instead of "Add {C} to your mana pool" upon zoom. As this change in template was not a functional change, these tokens continue to function correctly. | Cardset (Standard, Modern) |
| Ongoing | Cards that require a player to remove any number of +1/+1 counters (such as [Retribution of the Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retribution+of+the+Ancients) or [Ooze Flux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ooze+Flux)) incorrectly do not allow a player to remove any counters. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | Using the first activated ability of [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) while an opponent has only one card in hand causes the game to lock until the player who controls [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) passes priority. | Cardset (Modern, Legacy) |
| Ongoing | [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) incorrectly causes the player to search the library of the land's controller, not owner | Cardset (Modern, Standard) |
| Ongoing | Non-creature permanents destroyed the turn after an Equipment unattaches from them still cause the "when equipped creature dies" triggers of the Equipment to occur. For example, a [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) with a [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) attached when [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) uses its ability to become a creature will still allow a player to draw two cards even if [Sarkhan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386650) is destroyed as a planeswalker on the following turn. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) incorrectly does not count exiled creature tokens when determining how many creature cards to put onto the battlefield. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand. | Cardset (Commander, Legacy, Modern, Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) incorrectly prohibits players from casting spells that have both an even converted mana cost and a variable in the mana cost. For example, a player whose opponent controls a [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) is incorrectly prohibited from casting [Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) or [Nourishing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal), even if the value chosen for X would result in a spell with an odd converted mana cost. Even if a player cannot even, they should be able to odd. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | Cards that are exiled by [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) incorrectly show association arrows while in the Exiled Zone. | Cardset (Commander, Legacy, Modern, Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)'s second ability can incorrectly be used to cast face-down creatures of the chosen creature type.  | Cardset (Legacy, Modern) |
| Ongoing | [Myriad Landscape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myriad+Landscape)'s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Zooming in on a card exiled by [a land with hideaway](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5bhideaway%5d) shows an additional basic swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the swamp using hideaway. WORKAROUND: Right clicking on the exiled show will display it properly.  | Cardset (Legacy) |
| Ongoing | Under rare circumstances, a player who controls two creatures that can't attack alone (such as [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)) but must attack with one of them will be able to attack with only that creature rather than being required to attack with both. | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | When [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear. | Cardset (Legacy) |
| Ongoing | [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) incorrectly allows a player to redirect spells or abilities to the [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), even if it's no longer on the battlefield. | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | *Magic Origins* planeswalkers used as commanders will not return to the battlefield after exiling themselves. WORKAROUND: Players can avoid this issue by making sure the “Exile zone, not command zone” option is selected. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Copying [All Suns' Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) sometimes causes a crash. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Spells that target [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) more than once incorrectly trigger [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)'s ability twice. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command)'s first activated ability doesn't appear in the Effect zone after it resolves. | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | Conceding while looking at cards with [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) reveals cards to opponent. | Cardset (Legacy, Vintage) |
| Ongoing | Cards cast with conspire that require a player to sacrifice a creature as an additional cost to cast, such as [Life's Legacy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life%27s+Legacy) and [Momentous Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall), incorrectly look at the power and toughness of the last creature clicked for conspire. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) does not allow planeswalkers that enter the battlefield after activating [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) to use their abilities twice.  | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | When you play a *Ravnica*-block shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before you decide whether to pay 2 life.  | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | Casting [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) causes the game to be locked in a multiplayer game if there are no legal targets for one player. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). | Cardset (Limited, Standard) |
| Ongoing | If [Deceiver of Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+of+Form)'s triggered ability turns creatures into copies of a legendary creature, the legend rule fails to apply to the copies. | Cardset (Commander, Limited, Standard) |
| Ongoing | The mana abilities of [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator) cannot be activated while paying the mana cost of a spell or ability. Players can still activate these abilities at any time that player has priority. | Cardset (Modern, Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)'s triggered ability incorrectly triggers once for each time a spell targets it. For example, if a player's opponent casts [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), choosing [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) for both targets, the triggered ability will trigger twice instead of once. | Cardset (Modern, Standard) |
| Ongoing | [Goldmeadow Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Harrier) incorrectly prevents players from submitting or playing with a Pauper deck.  | Cardset (Pauper) |
| Ongoing | If a player attempts to sacrifice a pile of Eldrazi babies (Scions or Spawn) at once, only one of those tokens will be sacrificed. | Cardset (Limited, Modern, Standard) |
| Ongoing | Cardset | If [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) copies a land with a static ability and then is later turned into a basic land (perhaps by a [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) or [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas)), that static ability will not be removed. Triggered and activated abilities are correctly removed. | Cardset (Modern) |
| Ongoing | A player changing a trade proposal now fails to cause the Submit button on the player's trade partner's trade window to flash. | Trade |
| Ongoing | Collector numbers can appear misaligned on full-art promo cards.  | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | When some cards with madness are discarded, the triggered ability does not display the madness cost while on the stack. Players can find this information by right-clicking the card or by viewing the game log.  | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | If a creature enters the battlefield and then gains haste, it no longer indicates that it entered the battlefield that turn.  | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | Creatures with a protection ability incorrectly display that ability twice.  | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | When a double-faced creature is copied by a non-token creature, the copy is incorrectly resistant to effects that would turn it face down, such as [Ixidron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389565)’s triggered ability. Only double-faced cards cannot be turned face down.  | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | Emblems display with an extra border. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | The Search Tool is not present in the Other Products tab of a trade | Trade |
| Ongoing | Dropping out of a game does not concede the game if the player is not the first one to drop out | Duel Scene (Commander) |
| Ongoing | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. As a temporary workaround, logging out and back in resolves the issue. | Play Lobby |
| Ongoing | Land cards that use the multicolor land frame but do not have mana symbols in their rules text do not appear when filtering to display colorless cards. These lands do appear when filtering for land cards, however. | Collection |
| Ongoing | If a player's spell or ability causes his or her own cards to be revealed, those cards are incorrectly not added to the player's own Revealed Cards area. The player's opponent should still see the revealed cards correctly. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. WORKAROUND: You must start by ordering blockers for the left-most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | When face-down cards are given an activated ability, the art displays incorrectly on the stack when that ability is activated. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | When casting a spell, if there is any mana already in the player's pool, the most recently produced colored mana is automatically applied to the spell first. For example, if a player taps a [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) (naming Human), then an Island, then casts [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), the blue mana applied to the Delver's mana cost will be that from the Island. If the player tapped the Island, then the Cavern, the Cavern's mana would be applied to the spell, and it would be appropriately uncounterable. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Abilities that reduce mana costs are not correctly being applied to additional costs (such as buyback or multikicker). | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | While paying the mana cost for a card with delve, players cannot remove cards from the delve selection without canceling the casting process and starting over. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don't show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. WORKAROUND: The cards are properly identified in the game log. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Unusual mana in a player's pool, such as mana from a snow permanent or mana with a rider attached (as that produced by [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)) cannot be applied to a cost by clicking it. As a temporary workaround, players should produce this mana during the cost payment step in which they want to spend that mana. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | If a player makes a selection, then reverses that selection with the "undo" keyboard shortcut (default: CTRL+Z), the game log will sometimes incorrectly show both cards the player selected. Notably, this includes [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) and similar effects that ask a player to put one of a small number of cards into their hand. | Duel Scene |
