Packs of *Tenth Edition* contain premium "foil" cards just like any other modern **Magic** set. Foils in *Tenth* have a new twist for the dedicated **Magic** player, however.


![No reminder text.](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1374_noremindertext.jpg)Regular, nonfoil editions of *Tenth Edition* cards help new players learn to play by spelling out the meanings of abilities like flying, trample and shroud. But if you know these terms already, you can escape all that reminder text by collecting foil versions of those cards. Foil cards in *Tenth* have *no reminder text*.


In some cases, this allows more room for flavor text. Here are some samples of cards that gained significant real estate for some juicy new flavor textâ€”flavor that wouldn't have fit on the nonfoil versions, what with all the reminding going on.

In some cases, the lack of reminder text just served to give more room for *awesome*.

[**Magic** Game Day](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday&dcmp=ILC-MTGARCANA) is Saturday, and *Tenth Edition* is awesome. If you weren't going already, then for the love of Garfield, *go*.
