A *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) Standard Monthly Event is coming up on September 10! Players who have at least 35 Qualifier Points (QPs) in their account are eligible to participate. The series will contain 12 Monthly Events, each of which qualify top players for one of the four Playoff Events.

Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the current quarter and for the year as a whole. Players of sufficient standing on the MOCS Leaderboard(s) will also qualify for Playoff Events later in the 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series as well as the *Magic Online* Championship.
