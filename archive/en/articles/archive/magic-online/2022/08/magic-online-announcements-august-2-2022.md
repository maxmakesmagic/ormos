2022 MOCS Season 2 Showcase Qualifiers This Weekend
---------------------------------------------------


Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the 2022 Season 2 Champions Showcase!


The entry fee for Showcase Qualifiers is a format token that matches the format of the Showcase. As with QPs, after the season's Showcase Qualifiers are finished, all unused Format Tokens will be removed from players' accounts.


Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and an invitation to the 2023 *Magic* World Championship!


Showcase Qualifiers are scheduled as follows:





| **Date** | **Time (PT)** | **Time (UTC)** | **Event** |
| Saturday, August 6 | 8:00 a.m. | 15:00 | Modern Showcase Qualifier |
| Sunday, August 7 | 6:00 a.m. | 13:00 | Pioneer Showcase Qualifier |
| Saturday, August 13 | 8:00 a.m. | 15:00 | Pauper Showcase Qualifier |
| Sunday, April 14 | 8:00 a.m. | 15:00 | Legacy Showcase Qualifier |


Learn more about Showcase Qualifier events [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/mocs-step-2-showcase-qualifiers).

Showcase Last Chance Events Today & Tomorrow
--------------------------------------------


Following Showcase Challenge Weekend, your next opportunity to continue toward qualification for the Season 2 MOCS are the Last Chance Events. Three Preliminaries in either Pauper or Legacy are replaced with Last Chance tournaments in the next 24 hours.


These five-round events cost either 30 Event Tickets plus 40 Qualifier Points, or 300 Play Points plus 40 QPs to enter. If you win all five matches, you will earn an Entry Token good for that format's Showcase Qualifier next month.


Note that Limited and Standard Preliminaries during this period will fire normally.


Learn more about Last Chance events [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/mocs-step-1-showcase-challenges-last-chance-events).

Updates to Premier Play for 2022 MOCS Seasons 2–3
-------------------------------------------------


The [*Magic Online* event schedule](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/schedule-magic-online-products-game-info) and [Premier Play page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/2022-magic-online-premier-play-program) have been updated for remaining Season 2 events and with information about upcoming Season 3 events. You can see [Premier Play events newly added from August 27 and onward](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/2022-magic-online-premier-play-program#calendar) and view them in the aformentioned [event schedule calendar](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/schedule-magic-online-products-game-info).


The main changes for Season 3 (starting August 3) are:


* Entry for Constructed Preliminaries has dropped to 20 Event Tickets or 200 Play Points.
	+ While Play Point prizes have been similarly reduced by one-third, the QP amounts remain intact and Treasure Chests have been increased by one at the three-win level!
* Standard rotates into the fourth Showcase format slot, replacing Pauper.



---

Update: Season 2 QP Expiration
------------------------------


Due to the success of the 20th Anniversary Series, there are a larger-than-normal number of accounts that still have lots of Season 2 Qualifier Points. Those QPs were due to expire tomorrow.


As a one-time change, we are going to extend the validity of those Season 2 QPs for two extra weeks to August 17! This permits you to continue entering Limited Preliminaries from August 3–17.


Through tonight at midnight PT (07:00 UTC Wednesday), QP prizes will be Season 2. Starting tomorrow at 4 p.m. PT (23:00 UTC), QP prizes will be Season 3, usable only for other event types as normal.


Because of this, the prize payout will revert to the same one we used for *Modern Horizons 2* back in January:


* 4 Wins – 750 Play Points and 40 Season 3 QP
* 3 Wins – 450 Play Points and 20 Season 3 QP
* 2 Wins – 150 Play Points and 10 Season 3 QP

August Special Events: *Double Masters 2022* Duels
--------------------------------------------------


We have heard plenty of feedback from players regarding adding Limited to the menu of weekly Format Challenge choices.


As an experiment, we are going to try out a new event type on weekends this month that has a set number of rounds (like Preliminaries) but has greater prizes (like Challenges). For now, we are working these in around the existing schedule.


***Double Masters 2022*** **Duels**


**Time**: August 5–28, Saturdays and Sundays at 1 a.m. PT (8:00 UTC) and noon PT (19:00 UTC)


* Replaces Limited Prelims in the following time slots: 1 a.m. PT Saturday, noon PT Saturday, and noon PT Sunday
* New slot at 1 a.m. PT Sunday
	+ August 20–21 at 1 a.m. there are no Duels—just normal Prelims.

**Entry**: 45 Event Tickets or 450 Play Points  
**Format**: *Double Masters 2022* Sealed Deck  
**Min-Max Players**: 65–256  
**Rounds**: 7 (no Playoff)  
**Prizes**:





| Wins | Prizes |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 900 Play Points, 50 Treasure Chests, 1 *Double Masters 2022* regular set, and 40 Season 3 QPs |
| 6 | 600 Play Points, 25 Treasure Chests, and 30 Season 3 QPs |
| 5 | 450 Play Points, 10 Treasure Chests, and 20 Season 3 QPs |
| 4 | 350 Play Points, 5 Treasure Chests, and 10 Season 3 QPs |
