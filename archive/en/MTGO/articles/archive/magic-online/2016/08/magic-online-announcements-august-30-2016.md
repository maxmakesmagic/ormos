**Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Qualifiers and Season Changes**


A schedule of Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries was [just announced](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/qualify-pro-tour-aether-revolt-magic-online-2016-08-24) for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* and we've made a few changes for the upcoming season.


Starting with the *Aether Revolt* Pro Tour Qualifier season, we are shifting prizes for Top 8 players from the *Magic Online* Championship Series to the Pro Tour Qualifier events. Instead of each player in the Top 8 earning 15 Qualifier Points, players who finish 2nd-8th place will receive a PTQ Finals token so they can play in another PTQ Finals event without needing to qualify again through a preliminary.


Also beginning in the upcoming PTQ season, we'll be adding several new PTQ Qualifier times on Monday and Tuesday to accommodate different time zones and create more qualification opportunities on more days! Constructed PTQ Events will now have Preliminary Events on Mondays at 5:30 p.m. PT/12a.m. UTC and Tuesdays at 8:30 a.m. PT/3:00 p.m. UTC. Limited PTQ Events will have Preliminaries on Mondays at 3:30 p.m. PT/10:30 p.m. UTC and Tuesdays at 10:30 a.m. PT/5:30 p.m. UTC.


**Please Note:** For the first week of Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Preliminaries, **red** PTQ tokens will be awarded. **Blue** tokens that are currently in player collections will be removed during the September 7 downtime and Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Preliminaries will begin awarding **blue** tokens after that point. Normally, this switch would occur on August 31, immediately following the end of the *Kaladesh* season, but it is a skipped downtime week, so the rotation will be delayed until September 7.


Find out how to qualify for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* from the comfort of your own home with *Magic Online* [Pro Tour Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/qualify-pro-tour-aether-revolt-magic-online-2016-08-24)!
