Going into the 2013 Magic Online Community Cup, the hopes of the entire Magic community rest in the hands of eight talented players: Reid Duke, Melissa DeTora, Michael Jacob, Matthew Watkins, Tom Delia, Kenji Egashira, Jan van der Vegt, and Keya Saleh. Standing in their way was the powerhouse Wizards team made up of Aaron Forsythe, Mike Turian, Dave Humpherys, [Wort](javascript:void())h Wollpert, Alexis Janson, Sam Stoddard, Ryan Spain, Sean Gibbons, and Brian Clinton. The teams battled across *Modern Masters* Draft, Wacky Draft, "Ironroot Chef" Constructed, and Cube Draft to determine the 2013 winner of the Erik "Hamtastic" Friborg Memorial trophy.
