Unfortunately, due to ongoing disruptions of the global supply chain related to COVID-19, the release of the Japanese Set Boosters for *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* will be delayed throughout Europe. At this time, we do not have a date to share on when the Set Boosters will be available but will share updates as soon as possible.


Other languages and regions are not affected by this delay.
