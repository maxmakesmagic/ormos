We're less than a week beyond Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*, but the Standard format has taken shape and we're going to see it continuing to evolve with more events to watch this week.

One week following Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*, players will gather in Krakow, Poland, to show off what they have learned about the new Standard format. Dragons certainly made their roars heard last weekend, but will that continue into this Grand Prix? Will some new tech emerge, and will a new archetype triumph?



Join Riley Knight, Frank Karsten, Simon Görtzen, Rich Hagon, Steven Leeming, and Neil Rigby as they bring you live vide coverage of Grand Prix Krakow. Coverage begins on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Saturday, April 18, at 1 p.m. local time (CET)/4 a.m. PT/7 a.m. ET/11 a.m. GMT. Coverage resumes Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (CET)/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/7 a.m. GMT.
