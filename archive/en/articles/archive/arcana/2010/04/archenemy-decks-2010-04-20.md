A*rchenemy* is a new way to play **Magic**, in which one player takes on the rest of the table. And when it goes on sale on **June 18**, it will (like *Planechase*) have some preconstructed **Magic** decks. And those decks .... could be described like *this*.

### Bring About the Undead Apocalypse

Reanimate zombie horrors, use big creatures to lethal advantage, and hunt down other Planeswalkers with your aberrant army of the undead.

### Assemble the Doomsday Machine

Use machinery incompreshensible to others to build a doomsday device. Its sole purpose: to destroy the world and any Planeswalker foolish enough to oppose you.

### Trample Civilization Underfoot

When youâ€™re a Planeswalker possessed by a maniacal desire to obliterate civilization by unleashing the forces of nature upon the world, carnage can be the only result.

### Scorch the World with Dragonfire

When you use your force of dragons to rain down incendiary destruction upon lesser Planeswalkers, how can they hope to stop you?
