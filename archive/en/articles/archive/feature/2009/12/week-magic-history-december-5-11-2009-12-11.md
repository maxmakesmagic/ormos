### December 6-9, 2005: Historic Wins for Peleg, Swiss at Worlds

Celebrating history and making history … that's Worlds 2007 for you. Israel's Uri Peleg wrote the first major chapter in his nation's **Magic** book by defeating Patrick Chapin of the United States to become the 2007 World Champion. Peleg blazed a trail for his country when he became the first player from Israel to make a Pro Tour Top 8, and cemented his place in Pro Tour lore by taking home the trophy.


Peleg advanced to the finals with a win over Kotaro Otsuka, ending Japan's hopes for its third consecutive World Champion. Chapin defeated eight-time Top 8er Gabriel Nassif in the other semifinals in one of the most exciting matches in the game's history: a Dragonstorm-Dragonstorm mirror match, the final two games were decided by [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories)—to the roar of the audience watching the action live at the Javits Center in New York.
