On a day where everyone is busy with their own builds it is sometimes hard to get the top pros to spend their time with coverage builds. Instead I thought I'd bring you my own take on our test sealed pool. 



 The first thing I did, as always, was to look at the rares and the lands and see what directions they might pull the pool into. The rares had one of the best cards in the format in [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast), but at first glance not the mana to support it. With just an [Opulent Palace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opulent+Palace) as Green, White or Black fixers it would be hard to go either White/Black with a Green splash, White/Green with a Black splash or Black/Green with a White splash. Ok, so the deck was going to take a little more effort than that. Time to sort out the playables into piles by color and put lands and multicolor cards in one pile to see what might be worth building.
