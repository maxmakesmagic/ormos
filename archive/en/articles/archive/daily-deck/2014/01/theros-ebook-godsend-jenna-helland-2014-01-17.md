Coming in April, Part 1 (of 2) of the *Theros* novel written by Ramp;D Creative Team member, and ex-Uncharted Realms author, Jenna Helland. *Godsend*, Part 1 will release on April 22, 2014.


> *On Theros, Elspeth hopes the gods will keep her safe from the evils of the Multiverse. But the powerful planeswalker comes to the attention of the sun god, Heliod, who believes she is destined to be his champion. As the gods quarrel with each other, Elspeth must face a massive hydra that was unleashed from the realm of the gods.* 

You've been undergoing your own Hero's Path at events such as the *Theros* Prerelease where you chose your path when picked your Prerelease pack, or at *Theros* Launch where you decoded the message hidden in the stars, and at the *Theros* Game Day where you battled the hydra. In this ebook you will get a taste of Elspeth's trials and story as she sought to understand why she had been called to the plane.
