Rev up those engines and start piling up the energy counters, because *Kaladesh Remastered* is coming to *Magic: The Gathering Arena*. The set combines the best of both *Kaladesh* and *Aether Revolt* and will release exclusively on *Magic*'s digital platform on November 12, with all the cards in it legal in the Historic format.


If you missed these sets during their original release in 2016, *Kaladesh* is a land where technology and Aether are intertwined in every facet of life. Aether itself is represented in *Kaladesh Remastered* by energy. Energy is a resource that players gather and spend. It doesn't go away at the end of the player's turn, so there's no rush to use it. Some of the set's most powerful cards, like [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel), utilize energy for incredible effects like casting a spell for free.


A byproduct of refining that Aether is a special creature type called Aetherborn: humanoid beings that live fast and party hard. Because they only live for a few years, aetherborn experience as much as they can before they expire. Looking for one of these creatures to spice up your game? [Gifted Aetherborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifted+Aetherborn) is a staple in mono-black aggro decks and also fits nicely into Vampire-themed decks. It gains life, kills creatures, and does it all for just two mana.


There are also red creatures on Kaladesh that consume the Aether: Gremlins. [Salivating Gremlins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Salivating+Gremlins) destroys machines to get to the Aether that powers them—making them the perfect creature to associate with destroying artifacts. It makes them a frequent in-world target to exterminate—or in this case, [Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate), which is the premiere board-clear spell of the set that's likely to find a home in Historic control decks.


Speaking of Historic, Eternal format staple [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push) comes to *Arena* and gives black decks fast, inexpensive removal featuring one of the set's mechanics, revolt. Revolt grants additional or enhanced effects that are only activated by having a permanent leave the battlefield under your control during the turn. This includes blinking permanents or sacrificing lands like [Fabled Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Passage) or [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds).


Are you a combo player looking for your next big opportunity? Look no further than the triad of Modules—[Animation Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animation+Module), [Decoction Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decoction+Module), and [Fabrication Module](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabrication+Module)—three artifacts that work together to create creature tokens and strengthen a player's board with +1/+1 counters. While this combo piece will be in *Kaladesh Remastered*, one of the best combo enablers with the Modules, [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista), will be absent from the set. (Speaking of combos, you'll get [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) but not [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian), so copycat hopefuls are out of luck, too.)


But all is not lost for combo players—[Panharmonicon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) is back! Historic players will likely be familiar with how powerful repeating enters-the-battlefield abilities can be from *Core Set 2020*'s [Yarok, the Desecrated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yarok%2C+the+Desecrated). [Panharmonicon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) has a similar effect, but it's limited to doubling abilities triggered by artifacts or creatures entering the battlefield. As an artifact, the card is flexible enough to be played in any color combination. The best part? It isn't legendary, which means its ability can be stacked together with multiple copies.


The dwarves of Kaladesh believe the best way to stop an invention from falling prey to gremlins is to build it right in the first place. [Sram, Senior Edificer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sram%2C+Senior+Edificer) is a key card in Aura decks and offers card draw where players least expect it: in white. Dwarves are also masters of building and piloting vehicles. [Depala, Pilot Exemplar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Depala%2C+Pilot+Exemplar) is a legendary creature who ties *Kaladesh* decks together by strengthening both Dwarves and Vehicles.


If players want to be a little more flexible, [Metallic Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Mimic) is an easy inclusion in tribal decks. *Kaladesh Remastered* also includes [Foundry Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Inspector), a great way to cast artifacts with a discount and turn life gain into a win condition with [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir).


You can't talk about powerful artifacts without mentioning the Gearhulks. A memorable cycle of cards in *Kaladesh*, each of these colossal artifact creatures with massive power and toughness has a powerful enters-the-battlefield ability that can turn the tide of the game in your favor.


Anyone who's played *Magic* in the past year will be familiar with Vehicles, but did you know they first showed up in *Kaladesh*? Since their introduction, these artifacts continue to be a fun twist on creatures. Vehicles like [Heart of Kiran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Kiran) are only creatures when you crew them for the turn, which you do by tapping creatures with power equal to or greater than their crew cost. Often, Vehicles will have very high power and toughness relative to their cost, but don't forget to account for the crew cost when deck building.


The *Kaladesh Remastered* mechanics are rounded out by improvise and fabricate, two extremely useful keywords to have in an artifacts-matter set. Improvise allows you to pay for a spell by tapping artifacts rather than paying generic mana. This is especially powerful for a card like [Metallic Rebuke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Rebuke), which can potentially counter a spell with only one actual mana source as long as you have a few untapped artifacts—definitely a key player in Sealed and Draft.


Fabricate, on the other hand, gives players a choice when a creature enters the battlefield between getting +1/+1 counters or creating 1/1 Servo artifact creature tokens. In a handy synergy between mechanics, the tokens from fabricate are perfect for use in casting spells with improvise.


Planeswalkers, a staple of *Magic*, are in full force for *Kaladesh Remastered*, and those who were around for *War of the Spark* might recognize a few familiar faces, like [Dovin Baan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovin+Baan). A Vedalken first introduced in *Kaladesh*, Dovin hinders opponent's creatures, draws cards, and has a powerful ultimate ability which prevents opponents from untapping their permanents. Fun fact: Vedalken from Kaladesh have six fingers on each hand!


Dovin Baan serves as an authoritarian antagonist to Chandra Nalaar, who calls Kaladesh her home plane. Dovin, Baral, and the rest of the Consulate look to quiet the rebellion led by a group known as the Renegades. Chandra's mother, Pia Nalaar, is a member of the Renegades who works to improve the lives of those otherwise ignored by those in power.


There are other fun characters from Kaladesh, including Kari Zev, a sky pirate who works with the rebels and fights alongside the greatest creature token of all time, Ragavan. Imagine swinging into battle with a monkey by your side.


If you want to monkey around with Ragavan and the rest of the creatures on Kaladesh, look for *Kaladesh Remastered*'s release in *Magic: The Gathering Arena* on Thursday, November 12.


Preorders for *Kaladesh Remastered* are available now on the *Magic: The Gathering Arena* client.
