**Implementing the New Commander Tuck Rule on *Magic Online***


A [recent change](http://mtgcommander.net/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=17560) to the Commander rules states that, "If your commander would go into the library or your hand, you may choose to put it into the command zone." While this ruling applies to face-to-face Commander, it is not yet implemented in *Magic Online*. Our current goal is for this ruling change to go into effect on July 24, alongside the launch of *Magic Origins* Prerelease Events on *Magic Online*.

***Dragons of Tarkir* becomes Constructed-Legal April 1, 2015 on *Magic Online***


With the release of *Dragons of Tarkir* on Friday, March 27, the set became legal in face-to-face Constructed formats on the same day. *Dragons of Tarkir* will be Constructed-legal on *Magic Online* beginning on Wednesday, April 1.


"April 1," you say. "That's before the Prerelease!"


Very true, astute reader. Even though the *Magic Online* *Dragons of Tarkir* Prerelease doesn't begin until Friday, April 3, cards that are reprinted in *Dragons of Tarkir* will be Constructed-Legal after the April 1 downtime—a *Magic 2014* [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), for example.


 




---

**Pro Tour Qualifiers Switch to *Dragons of Tarkir***


Once *Dragons of Tarkir* releases on *Magic Online*, Limited Pro Tour Qualifier Events will switch to *Dragons of Tarkir*/*Fate Reforged*. Decks containing *Dragons of Tarkir* cards will also be playable in Constructed PTQs starting with the Wednesday, April 8, Standard Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminary.


The full schedule of Pro Tour Qualifiers for Pro Tour *Magic Origins* can be found [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/pro-tour-qualifiers-magic-origins).

***Dragons of Tarkir* Redemption Dates**


*Dragons of Tarkir* becomes available for redemption on Wednesday, May 6, one month after its digital release. If you collect the whole set on *Magic Online*, you can exchange it for a full, paper version! If you're interested in redeeming *Dragons of Tarkir*, don't wait too long because the set won't be available to redeem forever.

* Duel Scene | The "Reveal a Dragon" mechanic does not mention a dragon has been revealed in the Game Log

**Build Notes**


**General Fixes**



* Duel Scene | We have introduced a new look for effects on the stack
* General | We have updated the Banned and Restricted list on all *Magic Online* formats to match [this page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/bannedrestricted) including the banning of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) in Pauper and [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) in 100-Card Singleton announced [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/march-23-2015-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2015-03-23). In addition, we fixed an issue where certain versions of [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) were improperly allowed in formats.


**Gameplay Fixes**



* FRF | We have completely reworked how [Archfiend of Depravity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archfiend+of+Depravity) works to prevent players from accidentally sacrificing all of their creatures.
* BOK | [Genju of the Fields](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Fields) can no longer be attached to any permanent
* EXO | Fixed a display issue with [Exalted Dragon that caused a delay in the sacrificed land moving to the graveyard.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Dragon+that+caused+a+delay+in+the+sacrificed+land+moving+to+the+graveyard.+)
* FRF | [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) will no longer display the top card of your library in the middle of resolving [Write into Being](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Write+into+Being)
* FRF | [Flamewake Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewake+Phoenix) now checks for Ferocious on resolution in addition to the attack trigger
* FRF | [Monastery Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Siege)'s Dragons mode no longer incorrectly taxes when targeting spells on the stack
* FRF | If you cast [Write into Being](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Write+into+Being) with an empty library, the game no longer locks up
* FRF | We have fixed an infinite loop caused by [Channel Harm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+Harm). If both players have cast [Channel Harm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+Harm), *Magic Online* will now rotate between players asking if they wish for the prevented damage to be dealt to target creature until one player selects no.
* General | Canceling a partial payment of cumulative upkeep, now returns the mana already paid
* General | Casting tutor effects without legal selections in your library no longer causes the game to lock up. Examples of cards fixed include [Congregation at Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Congregation+at+Dawn), [Dwarven Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Recruiter), [Goblin Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter) and [Scouting Trek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scouting+Trek).
* General | Convoke spells are now considered as an available action when a user has used the F8 (Disable Bluffing) hotkey
* General | Fixed a crash that would occur when double blocking a trample creature. This also fixes crash scenarios where a single creature is blocking multiple creatures, one of which has trample.
* General | Fixed a display issue that would cause Auras and Equipment to replicate and/or remain on the battlefield after what they were enchanting had been removed
* General | Fixed a display issue with exiled cards not immediately returning to the battlefield when they should; for instance when killing a [Brain Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot) or [Banisher Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest)
* General | The game no longer locks up when discarding [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) during the resolution of [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance)
* General | The prompts and workflow for [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) and [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) have been reworked
* M15 | Players can now get black mana from pain lands without taking damage when [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth) is on the battlefield.

* NPH | [Mortis Dogs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortis+Dogs) now properly calculates life loss when it dies
* RAV | Fixed a crash that would occur when using [Copy Enchantment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copy+Enchantment) to copy a flip creature; for example, a [Rune-Tail, Kitsune Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune-Tail%2C+Kitsune+Ascendant) that has been flipped into [Rune-Tail’s Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune-Tail%E2%80%99s+Essence).
* THS | Fixed some corner case scenarios where [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver)’s –X ability would not resolve.


**Art and Text Improvements**



* General | Mana with special restrictions on usage has been cleaned up for clarity and consistency. Examples of changed cards include [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls), [Mishra’s Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%E2%80%99s+Workshop), and [Boseiju, Who Shelters All](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boseiju%2C+Who+Shelters+All).

* General | Creature cards no longer lose their art for the rest of the game when they copy a token through an effect such as [Polymorphous Rush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorphous+Rush), [Mirrorweave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave), and [Cytoshape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cytoshape)

* General | For cards that can be played out of Exile, renamed the Exile Zone (Can be Cast) to Exile Zone (Can be Played)
