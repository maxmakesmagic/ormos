*You sit down to [Rotisserie Draft](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/433) all the cards in **Magic**, and you're picking first. What do you take, and why?*


![Mike Turian](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_miketurian.jpg)**Mike Turian:** There is only one pick in this situation: [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus). Not only is [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) the collector's dream card, it is an incredibly powerful card for playing Limited. There are few cards that offer either the color fixing or the mana explosion that [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) provides.

I think the only cards that are close to [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) in this Ã¼ber-Rotisserie draft are [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) or [Sol Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring). The three cards Ancestral provides (plus it is another collector's gem) always is a huge bonus. [Sol Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring) provides the same mana boost that [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) does, but at the end of the day I'd love to walk away from any draft with a [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus).
