* Team members draft at the same draft table with one opposing team (6 total players per draft table). Each team member will be randomly seated between two opposing team members for the draft. No communication (verbal or non-verbal) is permitted between team members during the draft.
* After the draft, team members will be located to separate tables to record their draft pools (15 minutes for draft pool registration and verification). After draft pool registration, team members will sit together for deck building (30 minutes for deck building).

* Each round, the team match is won by the team with the most individual match wins.
* The Top 4 teams after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the playoff.
* Top 4 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3 games per individual match, with no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Each team member will be randomly paired against an opposing team member. Only 1 round will be played in the semi-finals and finals.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the players on the team that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 4 playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous games decide whether to play first in the next game).
