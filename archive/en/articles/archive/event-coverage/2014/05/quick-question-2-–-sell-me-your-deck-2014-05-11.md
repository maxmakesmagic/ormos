Modern is renowned for the immense amount of variety in it, and finding the right deck for you is one of the biggest things to think about for prospective Modern players. So, to make matters easier, I went straight to the source, talking to a few of the players doing well here at Grand Prix Minneapolis, and getting them to sell me on their deck. Here's what they said:

***Willy Edel on Jund**:* 
*"I think you should play Jund if you like these midrange kinds of decks. If you don't like them, this definitely isn't the deck for you. But if you're looking for a deck that you can tune to beat basically every single deck in the field, consider this. The main con for Jund is building wrong for your field, for example, if you build your deck to beat a lot of creature decks and only face combo or vice versa. Choosing the correct list is the most important thing. I would say that if you have time to practice, and you like midrange decks, Jund is the perfect deck for you."*

***Pat Cox on Zoo**:* 
*"[Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) and [Tribal Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Flames) are just ridiculously powerful cards that deal a whole lot of damage all at once. Playing a deck with a critical mass of one drops backed up by burn is really powerful. While I don't think that Zoo is as insanely powerful as it was back when Modern first existed, the fact that they brought [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) back, people initially reacted to it, but have now backed away from that reaction is great for the deck. I've played against people that don't have [Firespout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) anymore because they didn't think people would be playing Zoo. It really helps that no one is really thinking about it anymore. Zoo crashing and burning at the Pro Tour was one of the best things that could happen for people like me who want to play Zoo."*

***Jun Young Park on Scapeshift**:* 
*"[Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) is really good right now in this metagame. I got the deck from Lee Shi Tian, and he helped me learn how to play it. As long as there aren't many players playing Storm, [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) should be good. Also, fast aggro decks can be difficult. Sometimes I can't go off fast enough to beat them. But the way things are right now, I think [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) is a very good choice."*

***Paul Rietzl on The Rock**:* 
*"I think my deck is great! Now I know how Kibler feels at every tournament. You have the best deck, and you are the best player, but it just doesn't show up... To live a day in Kibler's shoes, finally! Honestly, if you expect a really diverse metagame, then it's a really good decision to play cards like [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) and a bunch of really powerful cards that get you ahead. If you expect a lot of Pod, I would not play my deck. They can grind the same way as this deck, but they are playing way more powerful things than you are. If you're playing against Twin sometimes, and Affinity sometimes, and WUR sometimes, and Jund sometimes...yeah, a consistent green/black deck with really good cards that has a ton of redundancy and gets to play [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) is sweet. My removal base is also really fun. I have two [Slaughter Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact), two [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)...no one will see any of that stuff coming."*

***Barry Smith on RG Tron**:* 
*"I figured there was going to be a lot of Jund and a lot of Pod, and I wanted the consistency. I just play this deck all of the time, and this was a really good weekend for this. If you like big, game-impacting spells—want to let your inner little kid out—Tron is the deck for you."*
