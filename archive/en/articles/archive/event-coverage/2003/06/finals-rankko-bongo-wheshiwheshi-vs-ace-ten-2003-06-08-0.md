![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams03/a873.jpg)One more match to go. Will it be the multinational Rankko Bongo Wheshiwheshi (Brazil, Argentina, France) or the equally multinational Ace Ten Off (USA, Netherlands)?

Seat B pitted current World Champion Carlos Romao against American legend Jon Finkel. Before Kai there was Finkel and with a couple of recent PT top 8's it seems like the American wants a slice of the pie again.

Romao is running blue-white against Finkel's aggressive red-green.

### Game 1

Game 1 was full of frustration for Finkel. His deck failed to cough up a third land and he ended up discarding [Fierce Empath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fierce+Empath) before he finally reached morph mana.

In the meantime Romao was battering him with two morphs. Finkel made a facedown [Blistering Firecat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat), but had to fling it in the way of one of the morphs. Unfortunately it turned out to be a [Wall of Deceit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Deceit). 

It wouldn't have mattered as Finkel found out the other morph was a [Zombie Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Cutthroat) the hard way when Romao flipped it in order to have a big enough casting cost creature to be able to counter Finkel's Vorine with a [Dispersal Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispersal+Shield).

Romao summoned [Covert Operative](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covert+Operative), then drew some cards off [Rush of Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Knowledge) and it was pretty much over for Finkel.

Romao 1-0 Finkel

At this point Kamiel was 1-0 up and Froehlich 1-0 down to give Rankko Bongo Wheshiwheshi a slight lead.

### Game 2

Game 2 and it was Romao's turn to be screwed. He mulliganed, and then passed turn two without laying any land. Meanwhile Finkel followed a [Wirewood Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf) with a [Timberwatch Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf).

I left to take the pictures I needed of the finals.

It wasn't quite over though. It turned out Finkel was badly flooded as the only other threat he could muster was an [Elvish Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Aberration). Romao came out of the screw with some morphs and [Starlight Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight+Invoker), but the [Timberwatch Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) meant all he could do was throw them in the way of the Aberration.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams03/a864.jpg)Finkel forced it through and gave it steroids in the form of an [Accelerated Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accelerated+Mutation). Romao tried to counter it by flipping over an [Aven Liberator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Liberator). Finkel shook his head and after reading the card more carefully Romao scooped.

Romao 1-1 Finkel

### Game 3

Romao zipped out of the blocks with a [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker), enchanting it with [Dragon Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Scales). A [Dispersal Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispersal+Shield) stopped a Dangerous [Skirk Volcanist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Volcanist) appearing for Finkel.

The American started to claw back the initiative as a [Ridgetop Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ridgetop+Raptor) was followed by Elvish Riders.

The Raptor traded with a [Riptide Director](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Director) and Romao summoned A [Dragonstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstalker).

The next turn was big for the Brazilian. He shut down the [Elven Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders) with [Frozen Solid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frozen+Solid) and brought out a Fresh [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker).

Finkel stemmed the bleeding on the ground with a [Goblin Dynamo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dynamo), taking another three points from the [Dragonstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstalker) to stay at a vulnerable 6 life.

At this time news came through that Barbero had won to leave Ace Ten Off on a knife edge. Finkel needed to pull this match back.

The Dynamo dealt with the [Dragonstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstalker) leaving just a [Skirk Outrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider) on defensive duties. Romao found a [Deftblade Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deftblade+Elite) though and the dorky little soldier was able to distract the Outrider and let Romao attack through to take the game, match and title for his team.

**Result:** Carlos Romao beat Jon Finkel 2-1

**Final Result:** Rankko Bongo Wheshiwheshi beat Ace Ten Off and are the Champions of GP Amsterdam.
