Yes indeed, after a long absence, Constructed Magic makes its triumphant return to an Australasian Grand Prix. Just up the road from the World Famous Surfers Paradise, the Queensland capital of Brisbane will play host to players from around the country and the world, deck builders and card slingers alike, all fighting it out for the crown of Grand Prix champion and a slice of the $30,000 prize pool. 


But of course it’s a Grand Prix weekend so that’s not all! The weekend will also feature an action-packed public event program that will appeal to all players, from those new to the game to those not so new. With events like Multiplayer Madness, Learn to Play Intro Challenge, a Pro Tour Qualifier, and a few surprises thrown in there really will be something for everyone. In addition, local stores will set up shop in ’Vendor Alley’ where they will have just the thing to complete your deck of doom, and world-renowned artist Izzy will be there to sign cards and chat. Add to that the chance to hang out with players from around the globe and its going to be one heck of a great weekend.


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#1).*
