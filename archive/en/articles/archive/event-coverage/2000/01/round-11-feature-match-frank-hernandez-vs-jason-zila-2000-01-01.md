![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/USNAT01/787.jpg)*Frank Hernandez vs. Jason Zila*Frank Hernandez disappeared off the Pro Scene after helping Team USA win the World Championships last year, but he came back to defend his spot and is, by most accounts, proving he is no one-hit wonder with a 7-3 record to this point. His opponent, Jason "Super Z" Zila is also not a fixture on the professional circuit, but he was a top player back in the day, and is attempting another comeback, not unlike Michael Jordan.


Super Z is playing a version of Fires with red and green Battlemages, and Hernandez is playing a red-green homebrew featuring tons of fast creatures, burn spells, and Tangle Wire.


Zila won the roll and went first, leading off with the classic Fires opening of forest-Elf and then a turn-2 Bird. Hernandez cast a Quirion Sentinel and then used the free red mana to Assault Z's Elf. Zila played a Fires of Yavimaya on the following turn, but was forced to sacrifice it to save his Bird from a second Hernandez Assault.


A third Assault from Hernandez offed Z's 2/2 Kavu Titan, and then a Tangle Wire hit the table and threatened to lock down Z's mana for the next several turns. Through all this, the Sentinel kept banging away for 2 per turn.

Zila eventually got three mana free and cast a Thunderscape Battlemage with no kicker just to get a body into play. "I feel like I'm playing sealed deck," he lamented.


Hernandez kept attacking for the next two turns, and Zila was down to 6 life when he managed to get a Shivan Wurm into play by gating the Battlemage. Hernandez kept Zila backpedaling with a Raging Kavu, and he sent his wacky collection of weenies - Kris Mage, Kavu, Lyrist, and Sentinel - into the Wurm. The Wurm took down the Kavu, but Zila went to two.


His large assortment of pain lands prevented him from casting another spell, and the Kris Mage finished the dirty work.


Hernandez 1, Zila 0.


Game two was incredibly one-sided. Zila's turns went as such: turn-2 Bird, turn-3 Fires, turn-4 Saproling Burst. Hernandez had played an Elf and a Scavenger Folk to this point, and they were powerless to stop the rampaging Saproling tokens.


Hernandez 1, Zila 1.


Hernandez took control in game 3 with a first-turn Kris Mage that kept Z's Bird in his hand for an extra turn. Frank followed up the Mage with a turn-2 Sentinel (burning for one) and a turn-3 Assault on the Bird that Zila decided not to hold onto any longer.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/USNAT01/789.jpg)*Frank Hernandez*Frank's turn-4 unkicked Kavu Titan was mashed by Z's kicked Thornscape Battlemage, and the Battlemage also traded with the Sentinel, netting Z a nice two-for-one. Zila was hoping to use this turn of events to start going on the offensive, but two Hernandez Tangle Wires kept Z from adding any non-land permanents to the board over the next few turns. He did manage to Ghitu Fire the Quirion Sentinel at instant speed and then remove Hernandez's Kris Mage and second Sentinel via a devastating Simoon, so that when the Wires faded away, neither player had any attackers out.


Finally free to use all of his mana, Zila dropped the bombs: Saproling Burst, Elf, Shivan Wurm. Three of Hernandez's final four draw phases gave him land, and he was not able to deal with Zila's resurgent army.


**Final Result:** Jason Zila 2, Frank Hernandez 1


Zila is still in contention for Top 8 but needs to win his final round to have any chance.
