 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 







I'm as big a fan of dual lands as the next **Magic** player, and while I like the [shocklands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Return+to+Ravnica+Block%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Land%22%5D&text=+%5Bpay%5D+%5B2%5D) of Ravnica just fine, I adore the [Temples](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Theros+Block%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Land%22%5D&name=+%5BTemple%5D) of Theros.

Trick "went deep" on the art of [Temple of Mystery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Mystery) [in this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/temple-mystery-2013-10-01), but I wanted to take this opportunity to "go wide" and show off the eight Temples we have available to us right now.
