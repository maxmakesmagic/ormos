Fans, creators, and some of the biggest names in entertainment are descending on San Diego now for Comic-Con, and so are we! If you're in town for the convention, be sure to swing by the Hasbro booth (#3213) and say hello. You can't miss it, trust us. We've got some exciting things in store this year, so let's break it down.


What are we doing?
==================


Short answer: Things, comma, several! All our activities and events (save one very special one, more on that in a sec) are happening at the Hasbro Main Stage. Things such as . . .


**Thursday, July 18, 11:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m.: Mark Rosewater Signing** – Mark Rosewater, lead designer for *Magic* and man of several million words, will be hanging out and signing autographs. Bring your copies of [Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro) and [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season), and plan accordingly.


**Friday, July 19, 4:00–5:00 PM: The Making of Chandra** – Nic Kelman, head of story and entertainment, will be discussing how a Planeswalker is created while Aleksi Briclot, artist of the original "*Lorwyn* Five," does a live painting of Chandra. There will be limited time for autograph signings, so bring your favorite [Aleksi cards](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Aleksi+Briclot%22%5d)! Aleksi will also be at Cascade Games's *Magic* play area (more on that below).


**Saturday, July 20, 12:00–12:30 p.m.: Cosplay Showcase** – Bring your *Magic: The Gathering* cosplay to the Hasbro Main Stage for a photo shoot! We want to see any and all kinds of cosplay—and especially your Chandra designs. And for those not in costume, we have a photo op at the booth as well! That said, we may even have some goodies for those who show up dressed as the Awakened Inferno herself . . .


That covers what we're doing at the Hasbro booth, but we have one more event in store.


**Saturday, July 20, 6:30–7:30 p.m. in Room 24ABC: Mark Rosewater's Panel** – This is the big one. If there's one thing you can't miss at SDCC, it's Mark's panel. This will be the official unveiling of *Magic*'s fall set, codenamed "Archery." Yep. That one. If you're not able to join us at the panel, follow along with what's being shown on Twitter ([@wizards\_magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/)) and stay tuned to DailyMTG after the panel is over for an article detailing all the info Mark shares during the panel.


What Goodies Are There?
=======================


We won't have any products for sale at the Hasbro booth, but our convention exclusive is debuting here and is available at the Hasbro Toy Shop across the aisle from #3213. If you haven't seen *Dragon's Endgame* yet, check out [io9's exclusive reveal](https://io9.gizmodo.com/magic-the-gatherings-comic-con-exclusive-brings-forth-1835871979) because it is *quite shiny*.


Elsewhere in the hall you can find *Magic: The Gathering: Chandra* comic publishers IDW (booth #2729), *War of the Spark: Ravnica* novel publishers Del Rey (booth #2913-U), and a limited number of copies of the *Magic: The Gathering: Rise of the Gatewatch* book at the Abrams Chronicle booth (#1216).


Where Can I Play Some Games?
============================


Maybe you need to take a break from the crowds in the main hall, maybe you just need the feeling of cracking open a pack or shuffling a deck to power through this huge weekend. In any case, we feel you. There's *Magic* play run by Cascade Games throughout the weekend outside of the convention center in the Grand Ballroom of the Marriott Marquis San Diego. Check out what they're offering at [their site](https://www.cascadegames.com/#show/sdcc-19).


See You There!
==============


There's a little something for all kinds of *Magic* fans at SDCC this year, and we can't wait to see you all.
