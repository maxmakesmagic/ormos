Brad Nelson took a Naya Midrange deck to a 1st-place finish at the end of October, but that deck essentially disappeared after that. He insisted it was a metagame deck that he'd bring back once the time was right. Perhaps JonteB feels the time is right?

 JonteB's deck is a little different than Brad's, as it has mana acceleration that doesn't play well with [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods). Instead of sweeping the board, JonteB is trying to power out big threats—[Polukranos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos), [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), and [Elspeth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth)—quicker than normal. 

 At first glance, the decklist might appear to be “budget” due to the lack of [shocklands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;format=+[%22Return+to+Ravnica+Block%22]amp;type=+[%22Land%22]amp;text=+[pay]+[2]) but that’s because the deck is entirely *Theros* block! You'd mostly want shocklands like [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry) to give you more lands to enchant with [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks), but [Nylea's Presence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Presence) fixes that problem quite nicely. The deck could use a couple more Mountains, but the advantage of having a three-color mana base that isn't incredibly painful seems huge. 

When a Block deck finishes well in a Standard tournament, it’s time to take a second look. With the dominance of Mono-Black and Mono-Blue Devotion, is it time for a new Naya deck to shine
