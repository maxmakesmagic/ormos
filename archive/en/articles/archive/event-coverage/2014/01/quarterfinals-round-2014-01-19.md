*Marcel Kachapow vs. Bernhard Wurmitzer*

The most lopsided matchup of the top 8 unfortunately also had the most predictable outcome. Bernhard Wurmitzer could only watch as Marcel Kachapow [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed his second turn [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) and followed up with [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) into [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter%C2%A0Twin), attacking him on his fourth turn with a billion 1/4 monsters. In the second game Wurmitzer had high hopes when casting a third turn [Karn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn) Liberated, while holding two more copies in his hand. However the first copy was met by mana Leak, the second by [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), and then a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to flashback the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) followed by a second [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and a [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) to finally discard the third copy from his hand. Although the match went on for a few more turns it was essentially already over.


**Marcel Kachapow 2-0 Bernhard Wurmitzer**



**Vjeren Horvat (Blue/White/Red) vs. Robin Dolar (4-color Jund)**

*Vjeran Horvat vs. Robin Dolar*

Robin Dolar, fresh off a top 8 in Vienna had been piloting his 4 color Jund with expertise the entire weekend. Unfortunately Vjeren Horvat came well prepared for the matchup. Having played it seven times already he only had a single loss against the archetype and he soon displayed why. A ton of removal backed up by Snapcaster to reuse it he managed to remove all of Dolar's creatures and finish the first game quick with a [Thundermaw Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundermaw+Hellkite). Croatian Vjeren Horvat took down game two in similar fashion, although it looked like Dolar's [Fulminator Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage)s might be able to keep him off vital mana. When they didn't he had no problem casting both removal, [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) and [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command).  
  
**Vjeren Horvat 2-0 Robin Dolar**



**Andrej Rutar (4-color Jund) vs. Emanuele Giusti Jund)**

*Emanuele Giusti vs. Andrej Rutar*
In the Jund-mirror that many might expect to be a long and grindy matchup the games finished surprisingly quick. Andrej Rutar took a small gamble in the first game, keeping a 2-land hand, and when he never saw a third land Emanuele Giusti was quick to put him out of his misery. In game two Giusti was throwing out cheap creatures while Rutar had more clunky spells in [Fulminator Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage)s and [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil). Giusti's two copies of [Scavenging Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) were able to control the size of opposing [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s, and an unanswered [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) found both lands and an [Olivia Voldaren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Olivia+Voldaren) that sealed the Jund deal.


**Emanuele Giusti 2-0 Andrej Rutar**



**Carlos Moral (Blue/Red Delver) vs. Jeremy Dezani (Junk)**

*Carlos Moral vs. Jeremy Dezani*
Ah the best also lasted the longest. The fourth quarter-final displayed some excellent games between (9) Jeremy Dezani and Spanish Carlos Moral. In his debut top 8 he managed to take the first game of the back of two [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer). Dezani could only kill one of them and was soon swarmed with [Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental) tokens, almost in chock when he realized how powerful the [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) is against his deck. For game two he took command early, and in the end two [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) was too hard for his Blue/Red opponent to deal with. The decider was a display of how poorly [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) matches up against [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer). As Dezani found no other removals Moral had no trouble casting instants to create [Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental) tokens to feed Dezani's Lilianas while attacking with the Pyromancer and adding Delver of Secret and more tokens to the board. In the end Dezani gave a look that in writing would have translated to “Nice deck”.


**Carlos Moral 2-1 Jeremy Dezani**
