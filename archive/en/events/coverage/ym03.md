Live Coverage of 2003 Yokohama Masters
======================================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/z997.gif)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a713.jpg)The last Masters Series has come and gone, and how fitting that the champion should be former Pro Tour Champion and Player of the Year Bob Maher. Playing a [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) deck that harkened back to the finals of Worlds 2000, Maher came to the event with minimal preparation. He had literally played no games of extended since Grand Prix – New Orleans in January. Still, he steamrolled the competition on his way to the finals.


There he faced Gabriel Nassif of France, himself a Pro Tour Finalist. Nassif got to the big show the hard way, through the Grinder on Thursday. 5-0 got him to the big tables, and he didn't stop winning once he was there. Playing Enchantress, he caught most of his opponents with their pants down, even beating Tomi Walamies and his wacky [Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth) deck to get to the finals.


It was not a good matchup for Nassif. Post-sideboarding the match seemed overwhelmingly in Maher's favor, thanks to [Sphere of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance). In playtesting the night before he posted a 12-0 in sideboarded games before deciding that was enough. The play itself confirmed it. He won the second game in spectacular fashion, floating twenty-four before putting [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) on the table. [Mishra's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix) was the first card to come down, prompting the concession from Nassif. Congratulations to Bob Maher, Yokohama Masters Champion!
