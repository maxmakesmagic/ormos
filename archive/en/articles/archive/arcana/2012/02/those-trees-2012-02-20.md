Monty's taking a week off so I offered to mind the Arcanas for the week. The wallpaper is already set for Friday so just four days to talk about...

I'll start off with a closer look at some Dark Ascension art.

[Grim Backwoods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Backwoods) is an awesome card, it inspired me to dig into a [Savra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savra) Commander deck. The ability works perfectly with [Savra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savra)'s desire to see things sacrificed.

I looked closer at the art and realized there was a skeleton on the ground. Someone died here!

Then my eyes swung to the right and I noticed that it looks like the tree on the right has some bodies embedded in the wood!
