City Champs Qualifiers run in stores from November 1, 2007 through February 29, 2008. These tournaments are 8K with a regular REL. Each City Champs store runs two Qualifiers per month, one Standard format and one Limited (either Sealed or Booster Draft). 
   
- [**Complete List of Participating Stores**](http://ww2.wizards.com/magic/citychamps/MasterStoreList.aspx)

Players participate in Qualifiers to earn points toward their City Champs Store Ranking. Store Rankings are based on Qualifier finish order, according to the chart below. Each store has its own Ranking, adding the points from only the Qualifiers within that store. Players may compete in as many stores as they wish and will earn points in the Rankings for each store separately.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Place** | **Points** |
| 1st  | 6 |
| 2nd  | 4 |
| 3rd-4th |  2 |
| 5th-Xth |  1 |


  
The top 8 players in the Store Ranking at the end of the season are invited to that store's City Champs Store Finals!


### City Champs Store Finals


Each store that successfully runs and reports a minimum of four City Champs Qualifiers will hold a Store Finals in March 2008.


The top 8 from the Store Rankings are invited to that store's Finals. Ties are broken by the highest number of first-place finishes, then second-place, etc. until the tie is broken. Absolute ties are broken by the highest-place finish in the first Qualifier event of the season one of the tied players played in. If any of the top 8 do not show up for the Store Finals, then their invites pass down to the 9th-ranked player, then 10th, etc. until 8 players are available.


The Store Finals are Standard Format, 16K and a regular REL, with one display of the most recent expansion for prizes. The Store Finals have no entry fee.


The top two players from the Store Finals receive invitations to their 2008 City Championship!


Once a player has received an invitation to a City Championship, that player may not play in further City Champs Store Finals feeding that City Championship.
