August Special Events: *Double Masters 2022* Duels

We have heard plenty of feedback from players regarding adding Limited to the menu of weekly Format Challenge choices.


As an experiment, we are trying out a new event type on weekends this month that has a set number of rounds (like Preliminaries) but has greater prizes (like Challenges). For now, we are working these in around the existing schedule.

* New slot at 1 a.m. PT Sunday
	+ Reminder – Saturday 1 a.m. there is no Duel due to the Modern Qualifier.

**Entry**: 45 Event Tickets or 450 Play Points  
**Format**: *Double Masters 2022* Sealed Deck  
**Min-Max Players**: 65–256  
**Rounds**: 7 (no Playoff)  
**Prizes**:





| Wins | Prizes |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 900 Play Points, 50 Treasure Chests, 1 *Double Masters 2022* regular set, and 40 Season 3 QPs |
