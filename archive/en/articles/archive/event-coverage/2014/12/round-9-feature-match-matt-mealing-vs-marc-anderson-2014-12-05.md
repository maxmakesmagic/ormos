### Game One


Marc Anderson won the die roll. "I'm gonna draw"


"You're gonna draw? So you can capitalize on your two [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment)s? Sounds fair."


The two traded friendly barbs about the contents of each others' decks. Despite an [Aegis Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aegis+Angel) in his, Matt Mealing was confident that Anderson would destroy him.


Mealing led off with three lands, [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Empires) and [Fiery Hellhound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound). Anderson passed on three lands. Mealing attacked and pumped three times, dealing five. Anderson undid all that with Timely[Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reinforcements). He triple-blocked when Mealing sent the Hound in. Stave off made the save for Mealing.


Anderson untapped and thought. Mealing made a helpful suggestion: "Timely?"


"I'm ahead on life, why would I Timely?"


Mealing laughed. "Because you're bad?"

Eventually Anderson chose to play [Warpath Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul). Mealing locked it down with the Crown and attacked for three. Anderson made no play on his six land. Mealing Crowned again and attacked, but saved his extra mana for [Blood Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre). He passed the turn, saying "You're up, buttercup."


Again Anderson made no play. Mealing was happy to attack for six and pass. Anderson shrugged and tapped four for [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). He followed up with [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), getting back his Ghoul. Mealing played out [Peregrine Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin), but Anderson was ready with [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). He spilled out his [Warpath Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul) and [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night).


Mealing boosted his defenses with [Crimson Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) and [Goblin Arsonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Arsonist). Anderson attacked with his team. Arsonist blocked [Warpath Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul), [Crimson Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) blocked [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night). After the Arsonist aimed it's death-damage at the Ghoul, Anderson saved with [Stave Off](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stave+Off). He further cluttered wht board with [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) and [Devouring Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Swarm), leaving himself empty-handed.


Mealing had a [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) for the Swarm but no other play, sitting on just a single plains. His Crown softened the blow from Anderson's attack, but he took four falling to six. Anderson played a topdecked [Tormented Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul). Mealing finally drew the plains he needed for [Aegis Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aegis+Angel), but Anderson was still in a commanding position. He plucked [Dark Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Favor) to upgrade that to "victorious."


Anderson 1 - Mealing 0


### Game Two


Mealing started with [Goblin Arsonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Arsonist). Anderson was happy to trade away [Elite Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard) for it. Mealing replaced it with [Fiery Hellhound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound), and then another, while Anderson summoned [Devouring Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Swarm). They traded hits and Anderson played [Drifting Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifting+Shade). Mealing hit for six and played a third Hellhound.


At ten life, Anderson took a moment to consider his options. Eventually he passed with five mana open, only two of it black. Mealing sent his squad. Anderson blocked with both his creatures and pumped his Shade to a 2/2. Mealing boosted the unblocked Hellhound twice. Anderson dispatched it with [Celestial Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge). The other creatures traded. Mealing passed the turn.

Anderson untapped and summoned [Zombie Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath). Mealing played [Peregrine Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin). Anderson was ready with [Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark). Mealing tried [Crimson Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage), but Anderson had [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh). The [Zombie Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath) brought Mealing down to ten, and Anderson added [Warpath Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warpath+Ghoul). Mealing put out a Piker and made the trade, falling to six. Anderson played [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night).


"Look at you drawing gas."


"I rip like a champion."


Mealing [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)ed the Goliath for three, expecting [Stave Off](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stave+Off), but none came. The Child swung in to leave Mealing at four. He pulled up a second plains and threw down Archon of[Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Justice), but Anderson had the trump: [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). Mealing drew his next card, then extended the hand in defeat.
