*Streets of New Capenna* hits *MTG Arena* on Thursday, April 28, and that means new *Jump In!* packets to choose from.


In *Jump In!*, you select from themed packets to build a ready-to-play deck. There are hundreds of potential combinations, and each packet has some built-in variance, so you never know what to expect next!

Event Details
=============


* **Starts**: Thursday, April 28, 2022
* **Entry**: 1,000 gold or 200 gems
* **Format**: *Jump In!*—pick two packets and play a combined deck with added basic lands.
* **Structure**: Play as many games as you wish, resign when you're done. You may pay the entry and rejoin to select new packets and play again.
* **Rewards**: First win awards an uncommon individual card reward (ICR), with a 5% upgrade chance to rare or mythic rare.

Where Are the Basic Lands?
==========================


You'll notice that basic lands aren't included in the packet lists. When you play in *Jump In!* events, you'll automatically receive a mix of basic lands based on the packets you choose, balanced for the costs and activated abilities on the spells in your packets.


Even better, you'll also receive nonbasic lands for play. Packets you choose will add dual lands from *Kaldheim* in the appropriate colors to your deck.


![Artic Treeline dual land from Magic: The Gathering Kaldheim set](https://media.wizards.com/2020/khm/en_PYSTjd5NCU.png)![Ice Tunnel dual land from Magic: The Gathering Kaldheim set](https://media.wizards.com/2020/khm/en_AV2j1xJ2CD.png)


If you haven't acquired these lands before, they'll also be added to your collection, and these nonbasic lands are factored in before basic lands are determined for your deck.


How Packet Selection Works
==========================


*Jump In!*will present you with three options for your first packet. At least one option will be a packet you've never selected in a previous run of the event (unless you've selected them all). There will always be at least one monocolor option and one multicolor option, and no options will have exactly the same color identity as another.


You will also be presented three options for your second packet. The options for the second packet are based on the colors of your first packet selection:


* If your first packet selection has one color, there will always be at least one monocolor option and at least one multicolor option. All multicolor options will contain the color of the first packet selection.
* If your first packet selection has two colors, there will always be at least two monocolor options, and at least one of each color. No monocolor option will be outside of the first packet selection's colors. If there is a multicolor option, either its colors will be the same as the first packet selected or it will contain both of those colors plus an additional color.
* If your first packet selection has three colors, there will always be at least two monocolor options, covering at least two of those colors. No monocolor option will be outside of the first packet selection's colors. If there is a multicolor option, it will only contain colors within the first packet selection's color.

*Jump In!* Packet Lists
=======================


Here, you'll find the latest packets and cards that have been added, as well as links to those added from past sets. Each packet list is followed by a table showing the alternate card possibilities. Reading across each row, you'll find the card names and their chance of appearing in that slot in the packet.

These packet lists are not card-for-card product displays but rather interactive lists of the cards included in each packet.)***
