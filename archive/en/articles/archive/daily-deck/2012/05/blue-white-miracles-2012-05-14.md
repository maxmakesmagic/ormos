When you lose the first round of any tournament, it’s usually a bad sign. In fact, up until [Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa's win at Pro Tour San Juan in 2010](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptsj10/welcome), no Pro Tour had ever been won by a player who lost in the first round. Alexander lost his first round this weekend. Oops.


Alexander Hayne, of the Canadian [ManaDeprived.com](http://www.manadeprived.com) team, started Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* with a 2-3 record during constructed before going on a tear such that he reached the Top 8 in the 7th seed. What’ll we will find though, despite its rocky start, is that his Blue-White Miracles deck proved to be the perfect choice for his debut Top 8 appearance. In the quarterfinals he defeated Hall of Famer Jon Finkel and SCG Black’s “Spirits” deck in the quarterfinals in his first five game match. In the semifinals he faced SCG Blue’s Joshua Cho who wielded Naya, grinding out a five game victory there. Then for the finals he faced a rematch with the Spirits deck, this time piloted by Gaudenis Vidugiris. All three matches taken to five games, and in every game of every match, we watched on in anticipation waiting for him to flip his next miracle.


This deck seeks to maximize the cost effectiveness of drawing a miracle card by stuffing sixteen of them into the deck. Utilizing cheap cantrip spells to reliably draw on the opponent’s turn and thus provide an additional miracle opportunity.


Before we declare this the best deck in the block, we have a prime example of a Rock – Scissors – Paper metagame. You might have noticed that Hayne struggled on day one by going 2-3 and then going 5-0 on Day 2. Why? Because his worst matchup, RW Humans, was largely wiped out by the other day 2 decks. This change in the event's metagame allowed him to face his more favorable matchups during the second day’s constructed rounds.


Congratulations to Alexander Hayne, Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* champion, the 2011-2012 Rookie of the Year, and the Team Captain for Canada in the upcoming World **Magic** Cup.
