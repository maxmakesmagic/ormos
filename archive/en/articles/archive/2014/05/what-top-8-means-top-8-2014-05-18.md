 Before any of the semifinal match-ups get played, before a single Top 8 spell is slung, all of the players who made Sunday's stage have won something – or several things – important to their long-term place in the game: a ton of Pro Points.




 Pro Points provide lasting advantages over both the course of a season and a career, especially when it comes to Pro-level status (Platinum, Gold, and Silver) and invitations to both the World **Magic** Cup and the World Championship, both of which carry more prizes and more opportunities to garner points.



Just for making the Top 8, every one of the players today gets 20 points, which is enough to swing things significantly in the races for invitations and yearly awards. 



 As a refresher, review the [Pro Player's Club Levels](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) for more information on what it means to make Silver, Gold, and Platinum. You can also view [Player of the Year standings](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/events.aspx?x=protour/standings/poy201314) (not updated for Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*).



Pro Points are awarded at Pro Tours by the following distribution:
