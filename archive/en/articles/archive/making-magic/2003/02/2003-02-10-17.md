| Hello Spawn of Evil,
I don’t know how you sleep at night the way you have butchered what was once the greatest game ever. You and your R&D demons have little by little nibbled away everything great about this game and replaced it with complete mediocrity. I hope you’re happy with yourselves.
May you all rot in hell! (If you’re not already too comfortable living there!)
Sincerely,
A Fan, NOT! |
