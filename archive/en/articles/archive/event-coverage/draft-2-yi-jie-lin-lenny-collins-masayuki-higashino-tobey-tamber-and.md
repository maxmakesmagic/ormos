With five players from Chinese Taipei, this 2-1 draft table was proof that they had rapidly picked up the format, or so it appeared. Full-time Magic player Masayuki Higashino's solid drafting in the first pod put him at 2-1, while to his right was full-time English teacher Tobey Tamber who had vicious land draws in the third round to put him at 2-1. As both are experienced drafters, I expected few surprises in their picks.


That was not the case with some of the players at the table with Quirion Sentinel being taken over Harrow (first pack) and five players in a row selecting red cards (third pack). The five color decks appeared to be rampant at this table, as personified by Ramanchandram picking Draco and Stratadon very high for his mostly green-white deck. As Collins stated at the beginning, "I'm horrible at drafting".


Yi-Jie Lin, two players to the right of Higashino, was solidly blue-white with Obsidian Acolyte, Repulse, Galina's Knight and Samite Archer as his first picks. To his left, Collins demonstrated an "interesting" draft strategy as he first-picked Ancient Kavu, but then selected Vodalion Zombie (right behind Yi-Jie Lin's Repulse) followed by Quirion Sentinel, another Vodalian Zombie and then Nomadic Elf! With none of these cards being particularly splashable, it made things interesting for nearby drafters.

Despite the four-color drafting of his neighbour, Higashino repeated his first pod by sticking with black-red after an opening pick Harrow, with the final intent of going black-red splash green. The first pick Harrow confused Tamber, especially when followed by second pick Ravenous Rats, but Tamber quickly caught on and went green-white when he was passed two successive Armadillo Cloaks. Red was particularly popular and this was never more clear than in the third pack when Higashino took Vicious Kavu, Tamber took Kavu Aggressor, Ki took Pouncing Kavu and Chang took Viashino Grappler, while Chao, the next drafter in line who had picked first from the pack, had taken Shivan Emissary! Tamber took a second Kavu Aggressor over Kavu Climber immediately after Higashino opened and picked Skizzik, suggesting that Tamber was very keen on playing red and didn't mind sharing as their other colors didn't overlap.


To Tamber's left, Ki was consistently black-blue throughout Invasion except for a calculated hatedraft of a Pouncing Kavu. This changed rather dramatically in the second set of packs when he suddenly dipped into green for Gaea's Might right ahead of Tamber in a vicious hate draft. Tamber almost became less than good-natured as a result, but after a few angry looks, Ki stopped taking green cards and started going all over the place taking Silver Drake over Lashknife Barrier and Planeswalker's Fury over Gerrard's Command and Dromar's Charm. Ki was apparently very concerned with getting kill spells as he selected Deathbomb over Bog Down in the final Planeshift pack.


Tamber's draft stayed the course as he continued to pick up green-red-white spells such as Voice of All, two Horned Kavus, Samite Pilgrim, Lashknife Barrier, Sunscape Battlemage and Fleetfoot Panther. The one disputable pick was taking the second Horned Kavu over Sparkcaster, a choice that few could defend. Higashino picked up some excellent black-red cards such as Thunderscape Battlemage, two Bog Down and Caldera Kavu. He resisted the urge to hatedraft letting Gerrard's Command bounce back as a 10th pick to Tamber. And he was more than happy to take the Sparkcaster that was passed along as it fit in his deck much better than Horned Kavu.


Collins kept up his alternative draft strategy by selecting a mixture of black and green cards with the odd red or blue card tossed into the mix, making him the seventh player taking red cards. Yi-Jie Lin was taking it all in stride as he consistently picked up blue-white cards except for one Nightscape Battlemage that he took over Samite Pilgrim in the pack he opened.


Apocalypse was not as crazy as it often is as most players had already determined their third color, perhaps a sign of a good drafter. Yi-Jie Lin dipped into red for Goblin Legionnaire and Quicksilver Dagger but couldn't resist taking the incredibly difficult to splash Planar Despair that he opened. Collins seemed to settle down on black-green, with Temporal Spring being one of the few important picks not in those colors.


Higashino, as a result, had very few options in Apocalypse. One of the risks of playing three allied colors and having only one set of opposing ones, is that someone to your immediate right will choose the same set of opposing colors leaving you with no backup plan. Higashino may have wanted to quickly switch into blue or white instead of trying to stick with green as he was forced to take mono-color cards such as Phyrexian Rager and Foul Presence over Squee's Embrace and Goblin Legionnaire. His deck looked much worse after the third pack.


Tamber's deck, on the other hand, benefited greatly from all these red-white cards getting through to him. His one questionable pick was taking Bloodfire Dwarf over it's bigger brother, Bloodfire Kavu as, or a second Squee's Embrace. On the plus side, he was rewarded with a 13th pick Lay of the Land in that same pack, but it was still a dubious call.


With no one taking the strong blue-red cards to his right, Ki was happy to take Jilt and Minotaur Illusionist for his black-blue deck. Alternatively he could have gone black-white, but the Apocalypse gold cards in those colors aren't that strong in limited relative to the blue-red ones. But outside of the Rakavolver he opened, the rest of his picks were Disciple quality as opposed to Razorfin Hunter quality.


Tamber drafted very well and has a good chance of winning the table with his two Cloaks, the Voice and other very solid cards. Higashino started off strong but ended up getting squeezed in Apocalypse. He also didn't open many bombs, such as the Tahngarth opened across the table. I expect he'll be able to go 2-1 on play skill, but a 1-2 would not be surprising. Yi-Jie Lin drafted very consistently though he wandered a bit in the third set, but who doesn't? I expect he will be 2-1 as well though his lack of bombs should keep him from 3-0. Collins's black-green deck splashing two Vodalian Zombies turned out quite solid after his early signal confusion and I can see him going 2-1 with his mix of speedy creatures and creature enhancement. Ki's hatedrafting earned him no friends, and I'm not sure it helped his deck much either. Between hate drafts and wasting picks on a fourth color he may or may not play, I don't expect him to have enough good cards to easily go 2-1 or better.


### Expected Results:


* Tamber - 3-0
* Yi-Jie Lin - 2-1
* Higashino - 2-1
* Collins - 2-1 or 1-2
* Ki - 1-2
