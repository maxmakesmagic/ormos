There are three Grand Prix, three different formats, all on one weekend. If you're looking for a variety of coverage to watch, or if you are interested in the latest round of decklists, this is the weekend for you!


And if you're not at home watching coverage, then it is very likely that you might be at a...


Regional Pro Tour Qualifier
===========================


This weekend is also the first set of [Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/rptq1st16) that will earn top players invitations and airfare to Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, which takes place in Atlanta, Georgia, February 5–7, 2016.


This weekend's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers are taking place in North America and Asia, including a special Regional Pro Tour Qualifier that is taking place on Friday in Indianapolis, the day before the Grand Prix main event.


All players who compete in a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier this weekend or next weekend will receive a [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) promo card, along with one of these sweet deck boxes:

The Top 16 finishers at all Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers will also get an event-exclusive playmat.

And, of course, the top finishers at Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers will get the chance to prove themselves at the Pro Tour in February. The Top 4 finishers at all Regional PTQs with 128 or fewer players get the invite, while the fifth- through eighth-place finishers get invited to the next round of Regional PTQs. If a Regional PTQ has 129 or more players, then the Top 8 finishers get an invitation and airfare to Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*.


But the Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers aren't the only thing going on this weekend.


Triple Grand Prix
=================


Also going on this weekend are three Grand Prix: Lyon in Europe, Porto Alegre in Latin America, and Indianapolis in North America.


Grand Prix Lyon is the first of the three, featuring *Battle for Zendikar* Limited in action. All players who compete in the Grand Prix Lyon main event will receive a playmat featuring the art from [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate).

Also going on is Grand Prix Porto Alegre, bringing Modern Constructed to Latin America as the format's debut with *Battle for Zendikar*. Which cards from the new set will make their way into Modern?


Players who register for the premium package to compete in the Grand Prix Porto Alegre main event will receive an event-exclusive playmat featuring the *Modern Masters (2015 Edition)* art for [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand).

The Flashback
=============


Last weekend featured a Team Limited Grand Prix in China as well as a Standard Constructed Grand Prix in Canada.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/OP20151030_GP-Beijing-Black.png)


Grand Prix Beijing featured 271 teams in China's first-ever Team Limited Grand Prix, as teams of three faced off for the trio of trophies. The Top 4 featured some of Asia's powerhouses and hometown heroes, and a North American team featuring Pro Tour Champions and some of the game's most renowned Limited minds.


While hometown heroes Liu Yuchen, He Yue, and former Team World Champion Zhang Zhiyang were a force, they were ultimately eliminated in the semifinals along with one of Japan's two teams, featuring Shintaro Ishimura, Yoshihiko Ikawa, and Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* Champion Kazuyuki Takimura. This left two teams remaining, both featuring their own Pro Tour juggernauts. On one side was Yuuya Watanabe, Makihito Mihara, and Yuuki Ichikawa. On the other side was Craig Wescoe, Richard Hoaen, and Mike Hron.


Ultimately, it was a [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) that Watanabe passed in the Team Booster Draft finals that sealed the fate of his teammate Makihito Mihara and allowed the North American trio to take home Grand Prix titles in the third and final match.

Meanwhile, Grand Prix Quebec City featured the first Standard Grand Prix following Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. The Top 8 featured some familiar sights, along with Pascal Maynard's Four-Color Rally deck and semifinalist Jake Mondello's Red-Green Eldrazi deck, which ramped all the way up to [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger).


In the end, Dark Jeskai would come out on top, with Dan Lanthier besting Omar Feldon in a two-game mirror mach. This marked Lanthier's second Grand Prix Top 8 as well as his second win, and on his birthday as well!
