![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPFLO00/190.jpg)Bram is another one of the Netherlands-produced top-class players, with good performances including, top 8's in Grand Prix Amsterdam, Chicago 99 and second in Cannes with Alex Shvartsman and Thomas Preyer.



Benedikt Klauser came 4th both at Worlds 2000 and P.T.Chicago 98, and is one of Austria's best young players.



The match-up was Klauser's Trix Deck against Bram's home-made Oath deck. Going into the final Bram was 4-0 vs. Trix, and with no definite sideboard strategy Klauser looked to be the underdog.



**Game 1**


Game 1 is definitely in Trix's favor, and Benedikt proved this with a turn 1 Mox Diamond Duress, and a turn 2 Necro, which resolved. He Necroed for 12, and passed the turn. Meanwhile Bram had played a first turn Village, second turn Flood Plains and third turn beat for three. Benedikt cast the Illusions on turn 4, having delayed a turn so he had backup and Misdirected Bram's Thwart which he was able to cast after playing a Volcanic Island. All Bram could do before receiving the Illusions was Gaea's Blessing his Force of Will which had been Duressed on turn 1. Bram conceded the next turn.



**Game 2**


Benedikt boarded into his aggro deck with 4 Negators and 1 Masticore. Bram boarded in seals for the Illusions and Oaths for the Negators. Bram kept his hand and opened with a Flood Plains, Klauser mulliganed to 6 and opened with an Underground Sea. Bram played a second Flood Plains while Klauser played a second Underground Sea. Bram sacced Flood Plains one in Upkeep and dug for a Volcanic Island and passed. Klauser played third turn Gemstone Mine and prepared for a war over Necro. In response to the Necro Bram sacced Flood Plains 2 and dug for a Tropical, before counterspelling the Necro. Klauser Forced, Bram Forced back and the Necro went to the graveyard. Bram then played a Seal of Cleansing, which resolved. Klauser Consulted for Necro, removing all 4 Negators from the game in end step. He tried to cast Necro with Pyro back up, but Bram had both the Annul and the Force of Will. He cast his Oath next turn, and beat Klauser's Annul with Counterspell.



Klauser cast his last creature, a Masticore with 2 mana free to regenerate from the Seal, and after Bram's Brainstorm revealed nothing the Masticore resolved. Bram Oathed up a Spike Feeder, and Impulsed into the second Seal of Cleansing which removed Klauser's last threat from the game.



**Game 3**


Klauser boarded into a mixture of combo and beats for game 3, hoping to just get the Necro early and do whichever he drew into first. For the first 3 turns both player played land, and the at the end of Bram's third turn Klauser consulted for a Necro. He Duressed Bram next turn and took an Annul from a God hand. Bram played a Tropical and beat with a Treetop Village on the next turn. Benedikt seized the opportunity of Bram's lack of mana, and chose to fought over the Necro. Bram Annuled, Klauser Pyroed, Bram Forced, Klauser Forced and Necro resolved. He Necroed for 11 and Forced Bram's next Seal of Cleansing. He cast the Illusions on the next turn and Necroed for 15. Bram's only answer was to attack with the Village and hold 2 blue open to counter. Next turn, Klauser Donated; Bram countered, and Klauser used another Force to secure the win.



**Final Result:** Benedikt Klauser 2 - 1 Bram Snepvangers
