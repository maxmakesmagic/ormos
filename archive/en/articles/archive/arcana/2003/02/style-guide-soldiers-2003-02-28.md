Here is a selection from the *Onslaught* Style Guide, which is a series of reference illustrations given to the artists that worked on the set. This particular image is of a pit-fighting Soldier.


Some of the cards that feature Soldiers fighting in the Coliseum include [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder), [Daru Cavalier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Cavalier), and [Crowd Favorites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crowd+Favorites). As you can see when looking at these cards, some artists chose to stay very true to the Style Guide, and others chose to follow it only loosely.
