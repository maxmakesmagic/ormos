 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






It is virtually impossible to be bored attending a Grand Prix. Even before the main event begins on Saturday, the schedule is packed to the brim with things to do. From simple 8-man Booster Drafts to massive melees, each Grand Prix has plenty to offer, and each Grand Prix is unique. Nagoya is no different.

Perhaps you want to prepare for this weekend's Grand Prix... Well what better way is there than to attend a Sealed Deck seminar hosted by Hall of Famer Shuhei Nakamura and the guys at TokyoMTG? Some of the lucky participants built their own Sealed Decks and learned as Nakamura walked them through what they had done well or needed to improve on. Even Yuuya Watanabe was so impressed by the turnout and the response from the many players involved that he offered his services for the next one!

Maybe you're more of an old-school player. Well don't worry, there was plenty of action for you on Friday night, as TokyoMTG hosted a Vintage tournament that saw 32 players duking it out with [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)es, [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk)s, and Moxen galore. Even better, they recorded both the Vintage tournament and their Sealed Deck Seminar with Shuhei Nakamura, put them online, and are working at getting them subbed into English! You can find links to the videos on their website!
