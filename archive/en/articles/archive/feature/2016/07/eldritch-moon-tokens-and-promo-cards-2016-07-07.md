Previews are nearly over—look for the [full Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/eldritch-moon-2016-06-28) tomorrow—which means I get to show off some of the cool extras that go with *Eldritch Moon*. First up, tokens!


In this set we have two emblems and eight tokens, though, fittingly, Zombies make up half of the tokens you'll find in booster packs. Let's check those four out first:

While Zombies are obviously top of mind here, we have a number of other Innistrad residents and interlopers joining the token ranks as well.

And, of course, two of our intrepid planeswalkers produce emblems. So we produced them for you.

Let's also turn our attention to the promos you can get with the release of *Eldritch Moon*. You've likely already seen a lot of these, but it's good to have them all in one place, right?


First up, the Buy-a-Box promo is Thalia, Heretic Cathar. Stores will be able to provide a small number of this promo, and the distribution is up to stores—so find your way to your nearest store and ask how you can get your hands on this sweet promo.

Next up is the Launch Promo, a creature that will very politely borrow your face for a turn. But they'll give it back!

Then, of course, comes Game Day, where just for participating you'll get this full-art version of Unsubstantiate.

Now the one you likely haven't seen yet, at least not in promo form. Today, Gavin Verhey previewed Heron's Grace Champion (check it [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/trouble-tribals-2016-07-07)). If you make the Top 8 of Game Day, you'll receive this version of that same spicy card:

And if everything goes your way and you're crowned the Game Day Champion at your store? You'll receive this fantastic-looking playmat.
