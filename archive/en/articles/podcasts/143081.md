**Rich Hagon**  



**MAY EPISODE**



* Looking to improve your Limited game? Or are you just starting your trek down the road to drafting? Former Limited Information columnist and current development intern Noah Weil opens up his bag of tricks and lets you in on some of his best tips and draft philosophies. From signaling to hate-drafting to power curves, he covers all the basics to get you to the top of your draft table.
* So just what is the life of a Great Designer Search intern all about? Kenneth Nagle stops by to talk about his introduction to the design process and what the last six months inside Wizards of the Coast have been like. Ken also delves into the world of Type 4 (also known as Limited Infinity), a great alternate Constructed format that gives you infinite mana -- but you can only play one spell per turn. To see Ken's house rules for the format and his 340-card decklist, [click here](http://archive.wizards.com/MAGIC/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/podcast/17#type4).
* May features plenty of opportunities for you to get out and play with the complete *Time Spiral*block. First up is [Regionals in the United States and Canada](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/regionals) on June 9. With Ninth Edition, Ravnica, Coldsnap, and Time Spiral, the Standard environment has never been bigger. Get your deck together and take your first step on the Road to Worlds. Also up in June is [Grand Prix-Montreal](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/grandprix/montreal07), the first Block Constructed event to feature *Future Sight*, on June 23-24. Finally, the month wraps up with [Pro Tour-San Diego](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/sandiego07) on June 29-July 1, where the top players in the world put their heads together -- literally -- for the first Two-Headed Giant Booster Draft Pro Tour!
