I've played four Pro Tours, a MOCS, and a World *Magic* Cup. I was Silver this season, but I never did well at any big event.


**What was the best card in your sealed deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your record?**


[Drover of the Mighty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drover+of+the+Mighty). I was playing green-white splashing red for [Sunbird's Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbird%27s+Invocation) which I think is good in Sealed Deck. I didn't actually like my deck that much though. I went 7-2.


**What was the best card in your first draft deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your record?**


I first and second picked [Legion's Landing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion%27s+Landing) which was my best card everytime. I played White-Black Vampires and went 3-0.

In the second draft my best card was Adanto's Vanguard. Although [Settle the Wreckage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Settle+the+Wreckage) is normally better, Vanguard was very, very good. I played White-Black Vampires again for another 3-0 record.
