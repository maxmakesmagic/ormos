**What deck are people going to play this weekend that they absolutely should not play?**

***Craig Wescoe, Pro Tour Dragon's Maze Champion**: Burn. Only because I don't want to play against it.*

***Jeremy Dezani, #2 Ranked Player**: Mono-Blue Tron (Shampoo). In testing it didn't win a single game.*

***Stanislav Cifka, Pro Tour Return To Ravnica Champion**: I haven't played a game of Modern since the Pro Tour, but I think Splinter-Twin is overplayed.*

***Martin Juza, Two-Time Pro Tour Top 8'er**: Soul Sisters. I mean, you can play any deck if you're familiar with it and know your matchups and sideboarding, but mono-white life gain never wins.*

***Jacob Wilson, Pro Tour Born of the Gods Finalist**: Splinter Twin. Black-Green decks are going to be popular this weekend, and have a good matchup against it.*

***Alexander Hayne, Pro Tour Avacyn Restored Champion**: Bogles. The deck doesn't have what it takes to make it through fifteen rounds and dodge all the hate.*
