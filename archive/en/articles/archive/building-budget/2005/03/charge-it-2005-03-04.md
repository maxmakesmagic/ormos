Welcome to artifact week! Rather, welcome to the end of it, along with the end of a certain deck that has been abusing these trinkets to no end. Overall, I have high hopes for what Standard will look like post-bannings, but if you want the whole scoop make sure to check out [Aaron's article](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/eight-plus-one-2005-03-04) today. I am not here to steal his thunder…I am here to play with toys.

Charge it! No, I am not talking about credit cards, I am talking about charge counters! Now, I have done a charge counter deck in the past, and it was pretty cool, but now with the full power of *Mirrodin* and *8th Edition*, and the pesky Ravager deck out of the way…all new cool sorts of decks can come out of hiding.

Come forth cool decks! Fear not the Ravager!

![Thunderstaff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thunderstaff)This deck takes advantage of the awesome power of [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) with [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel). [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) is simply an awesome card that never got the credit it was due. While one [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) doesn't shut anyone down (although it's still powerful), playing a second or copying it with [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel) really hurts most creature decks, slowing them to a crawl. This extra time allows you to win in any cool ways you prefer!…and I prefer [Lightning Coils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Coils)! Ever since I drafted the Power Conduit deck in Grand Prix Kansas City to make Top 8 I have a soft spot in my heart for those crazy charge counter-based cards from *Mirrodin*. [Lightning Coils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Coils) has many mini [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning)s hidden in its wiring, and it's not afraid to unleash them! You can easily help it along with [Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit) and a charge counter generator, or simply by using [Energy Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Chamber)s.

The lands in an artifact based deck get to do all sorts of cool things too, since they don't need the restriction of producing silly colored mana. [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s, Urzatron, [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones)…you name it. Not to mention the charging powers of [Mirrodin's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrodin%27s+Core).

Let's check out this gizmo.

![Coretapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Coretapper)The deck plays out by gearing up with a Myr on the second turn, following up with some combination of shiny artifacts. There are a lot of different ways games can go, but the big decisions you are going to make will likely involve [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel). There are three great targets for [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel): [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff), [Energy Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Chamber), and [Coretapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper). [Coretapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper), while looking innocent, is actually a great beating in this deck, especially in combination with [Lightning Coils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Coils). In fact, you can get a rather quick kill with them:Turn 2: [Coretapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper)

Turn 3: [Lightning Coils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Coils), put a counter on it.

Turn 4: [Coretapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper), tap the first one to put another counter on the Coils. Sacrifice both for 2 counters each, plus 1 counter each from them going to the graveyard.

Turn 5: During your upkeep, the Coils crack for 8 counters and you get 8 wonderful little [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning)s that smash your opponent for 24 damage. W00t!

Note that you can use either a second [Coretapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper) or a [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel), so this isn't actually that uncommon of a draw. Not too shabby for a little dude eh?

Your other route to victory is building one of your little Myr into a giant monster with the aid of [Energy Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Chamber)s and [Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit). It takes surprisingly fewer turns than you might expect. One good strategy is to divide your counters among a few Myr so that they can all start to attack, then you can pump them on the offense with your [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) to finish the job, and [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) can help out if the going gets tough.

### Tips on Playing the Deck

* Normally you won't want to pump your [Coretapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper) with the +1/+1 counters; he has other work to do instead of attacking.
* ![Altar of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Altar+of+Shadows)[Altar of Shadows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Shadows) is a nice catch-all. If you need a mana boost to activate it every turn, throw some counters on it. Just be sure to have a [Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit) around in order to pull them off again later as +1/+1 counters. You can also activate a [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones) over and over again as a mana sink.
* Don't store your charge counters from [Coretapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coretapper) on itself…it is too fragile of a target. Throw them on an Icy or a [Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit) or whatever random artifact you have to keep them safe for moving with the Conduit later.
* Try to get as many counters on the [Lightning Coils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Coils) as possible once you are going to go over 5. This will maximize the amount of damage you do with each wave of [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning)s.

### Adding Money to the Deck

There are lots of cool things you can add with this theme, even just within the realm of artifacts. [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) is the single best card to add to this deck. It gives you an evasion artifact creature that you can pump up with your [Power Conduit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit)s. It is also a great way to get around [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) effects. You can splash a little red for [Bosh, Iron Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh%2C+Iron+Golem) or even do something a bit flashier with blue: add 4 [Fabricate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabricate)s and the Kaldra pieces! You could also go with [Urza's Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Armor)s to strengthen the [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) theme. If you wanted to go more red, you could use [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) and [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast). 

Overall this deck is a ton of fun and is much more competitive than you might expect. I mostly wanted to illustrate that the rest of *Mirrodin* works fine even without the artifact lands. In many ways it is like a whole block of cards just got unbanned for competitive play! Enjoy the new format folks!

Until next time, [Feldon's Cane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Feldon%2527s%2BCane).
