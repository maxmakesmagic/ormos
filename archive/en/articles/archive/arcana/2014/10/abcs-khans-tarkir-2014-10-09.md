Let's take a Gatherer dive through  *Khans of Tarkir* , letter by letter. Some of these might be more of a stretch than others, so bear with me.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/cardart_KTKbear.jpg)
Bear Token | Art by [Kev Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Kev Walker%22])


A is for Ascendancy, [of which there are five](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+[%22Khans+of+Tarkir%22]&name=+[Ascendancy]). A is also for Abzan, the white-black-green clan, which has [30 cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&mark=+[%22Abzan%22]) bearing its watermark.


B is for Banner, [one for each clan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+[%22Khans+of+Tarkir%22]&name=+[Banner]). B is also for bear, because there are an awful lot of them running around Tarkir, and they sure do get [punched](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch).


C is for Charm. As you probably know, there are also [five of them](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+[%22Khans+of+Tarkir%22]&name=+[Charm]).


D is for dual lands. There are [ten of them](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=[%22Khans+of+Tarkir%22]&type=+[%22Land%22]+![%22Basic%22]&rarity=+[C]), all at common, and they go by several nicknames: "KTK Refuges" (based off the original  [cycle of five from *Zendikar*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=[%22Zendikar%22]&type=+[%22Land%22]&name=+[%22Refuge%22]) , each with Refuge in the name), "lifelands," and "KTK duals" are the ones I've seen most. D is also for [delve](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/mechanics-khans-tarkir#anchor3), the Sultai mechanic that returns to us from *Future Sight*, which is [on eleven cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&text=+[delve]).


E is for Elk, because [Elk tribal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&subtype=+[Elk]) has become a thing in recent sets. You're welcome, [Marshall](http://lrcast.com/).


F is for fetch lands. These [five rare lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+[%22Land%22]&text=+[search]+[your]+[library]&set=|[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]) originally saw print in *Onslaught*. Their inclusion in *Khans of Tarkir* makes them legal in the Modern format for the first time. F is also for [ferocious](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/mechanics-khans-tarkir#anchor5), the Temur mechanic, which is [on eleven cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&text=+[ferocious]).


G is for Goblin, a creature type with [a couple of distinctive looks on Tarkir](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/monster-menagerie-goblins-2014-09-24).


H is for Honolulu, the [always-popular site](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/hi-again-2014-10-07) of Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*.


I is for ibex, which pull Anafenza around on her chariot and also serve as mounts [for the Abzan](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/planeswalkers-guide-khans-tarkir-part-1-2014-09-03).


J is for Jeskai, the blue-red-white clan. Like Abzan, [30 cards bear the Jeskai watermark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&mark=+[%22Jeskai%22]).


K is for khans, because of course it is. There are [five legendary creatures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=[%22Khans+of+Tarkir%22]&type=+[%22Legendary%22]+[%22Creature%22]) in the set, each the leader of his or her clan.


L is for Loxodon, as in [Woolly Loxodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Loxodon), biggest (power + toughness) common and morph creature in the set. That ties ol' Woolly with [Pearl Lake Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Lake+Ancient) (a mythic rare!) for the *second* highest P/T sum at 13. The biggest creature in the set? The rare turtle [Meandering Towershell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meandering+Towershell), at 14.


M is for Mardu, the red-white-black clan. The Horde claims [29 cards with its watermark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&mark=+[%22Mardu%22]). M is also for [morph](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/mechanics-khans-tarkir#anchor6), which originated in *Onslaught* and is in all five clans. There are [35 creatures with morph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&text=+[morph]).


N is for [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386617), a common, a reprint, and the only card whose name begins with N not represented by any other link in this article.


O is for [outlast](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/mechanics-khans-tarkir#anchor1), the Abzan mechanic. There are [nine creatures with outlast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&text=+[outlast]). O is also for Orc, a creature type making its triumphant return to *Magic* [with seven cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&subtype=+[Orc]) in *Khans of Tarkir*.


P is for [prowess](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/mechanics-khans-tarkir#anchor2), the Jeskai mechanic, which appears [on ten creatures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&text=+[prowess]).


Q is for [Quiet Contemplation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Contemplation). Shh...


R is for [raid](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/mechanics-khans-tarkir#anchor4), the Mardu mechanic that appears not just on creatures, but [on eleven cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&text=+[raid]) of various types. R is also for [Rakshasa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]&name=+[Rakshasa]), a type of creature from [Hindu mythology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakshasa) making its *Magic* debut on Tarkir.


S is for Sultai, the black-green-blue clan, which commands the highest number of clan-related cards with a total of [36 cards bearing its watermark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&mark=+[%22Sultai%22]).


T is for Temur, the green-blue-red clan, which has [31 cards with its watermark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&mark=+[%22Temur%22]). T is also for [tri-lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=[%22Khans+of+Tarkir%22]&type=+[%22Land%22]&rarity=+[U]&text=+[%22tapped%22]), the five lands that tap for clan-specific colors.


U is for Ugin, [who is dead](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ur/sorins-revelation-2014-09-24). (Spoilers!) But his [Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%27s+Nexus) yet remains.


V is for [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth), a very vexing vindication of the vanity of venal value we vouch when villain visits violence upon victim who, vacant the vestige of volition, views vicariously the verdict of victory.


W is for wedge, which is what we call the three-color groupings that make up the clans' colors.


X is for [Empty the Pits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Pits), or more specifically its casting cost, which is the first black card with XX in its casting cost.


Y is for Yasimin Ankleshank, a female goblin warrior, we are told by the [Planeswalker's Guide](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/planeswalkers-guide-khans-tarkir-part-2-2014-09-10#mardu), is "famed for her rash battle expertise."


Z is for [Zurgo Helmsmasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zurgo+Helmsmasher), who gets a second callout because he's the only card that starts with Z. Oh, and also because he was a face card for  [*Duel Decks: Speed vs. Cunning*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/duel-decks-speed-vs-cunning-2014-08-18) .
