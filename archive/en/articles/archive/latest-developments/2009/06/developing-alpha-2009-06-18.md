Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now. 





M**agic** Ramp;D is full of smart people, and we often ask each other questions merely to provoke thought. Some of these questions strike us as so interesting that we end up asking them over and over again. One such question is what the most successful **Magic** set ever is. When we asked **Magic** developer Erik Lauer, he claimed that the answer was clearly Alpha. After all, no other set in **Magic**'s history established an entirely new collectible card game. One of the reasons that Alpha attracted so many players was its focus on top-down design; that is, the cards all represented things that were easily understandable by anyone who had experienced fantasy before.
