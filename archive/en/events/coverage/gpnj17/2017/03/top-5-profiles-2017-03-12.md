Top 8 is huge. It locks in a flight to Japan while getting closer to my goal of Gold. It would mean I haven’t been wasting my time this year.

Nahiri, because it is my only answer to [Authority of the Consuls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Authority+of+the+Consuls) in the mirror for a game 2, when the game degenerates to a board stall.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you? And what would it mean if you won?**
