| **Fun with Fungus**  / 
 Thallids are sentient, mobile fungus creatures that share a symbiotic relationship with saprolings. Thallids do exactly two things: spread and consume. Aided by Thelon of Havenwood, they’re doing both quite well. In the wake of an apocalypse, what would thrive better than mold? |  |
| **Hope’s Crusaders** 
 Dominaria is rubble. The coalition army was demolished in the apocalypse. Paranoia runs high and lawlessness abounds. And yet something noble stirs. Pride. Power. Might. An ever-growing band of defiant survivors have joined together to fight for the one thing they value most: hope. |  |
| **Reality Fracture**  / 
 The problem with temporal disasters is you never know when the fallout will appear. Urza’s botched time experiments happened hundreds of years ago, but the ripples they left in the time stream—including storm and suspend—are tearing apart the fabric of reality right about . . . now. |  |
| **Sliver Evolution**  /  / 
 The new generation is here! Slivers are resilient, adaptable, vicious predators ruled by a hive mind. Revived by researchers after the apocalypse, they quickly mutated out of control, and now they rampage unchecked across the devastated landscape. Join them—after all, slivers love to share. |  |
