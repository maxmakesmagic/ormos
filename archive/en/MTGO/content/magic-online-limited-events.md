Pro Tour Qualifiers
-------------------



*Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers (PTQs) consist of a set of PTQ Preliminaries that grant tokens that can be used to enter a PTQ Finals event. Winners of PTQ Finals receive invitations to the associated Pro Tour as well as the associated Pro Tour Challenge.


*Magic Online* hosts sixteen Pro Tour Qualifier Finals following each set of PTQ Preliminaries. PTQ Preliminaries grant Constructed and Limited tokens of two different colors, red and blue. Constructed PTQ Preliminaries award only Constructed tokens, and Limited PTQ Preliminaries only award Limited tokens. Similarly, you can only use Constructed entry tokens to join Constructed PTQ Finals, and you can only use Limited entry tokens to join Limited PTQ Finals. Players may participate in as many PTQ Preliminaries as they like and earn as many tokens as they'd like. Participation in *Magic Online* PTQ Preliminaries and PTQ Finals is open only to players who have not been invited to the associated Pro Tour. PTQ Finals tokens can't be transferred.

Magic Online Championship Series Events
---------------------------------------



The *Magic Online* Championship Series, also known as MOCS, is a series of events in which top players can earn an invitation to the annual in-person *Magic Online* Championship event, as well as a Pro Tour event.


Throughout the qualifying period from the conclusion of the November 25, 2015 downtime until the September 28, 2016 downtime, players earn Qualifier Points (QPs) by playing in events that award QPs as part of their prize structure. The series will contain 12 Monthly Events, each of which qualify top players for one of the four Playoff Events. These Playoff Events qualify top players for the *Magic Online* Championship, a Pro Tour, and the Pro Tour Challenge event at that Pro Tour.


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the current quarter and for the year as a whole. Players of sufficient standing on the [MOCS Leaderboard(s)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) will also qualify for Playoff Events later in the 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series as well as the *Magic Online* Championship.
