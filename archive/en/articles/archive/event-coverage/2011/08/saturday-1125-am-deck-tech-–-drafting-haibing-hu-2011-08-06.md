Texan **Magic** veteran Haibing Hu went 7-0 on day one here at Nats and closed out the last three rounds in convincing fashion with a Goblin deck in the *Magic 2012* draft format. As he sat down at a table with the other two 7-0 players -- Joshua Howe and Wesley Wise -- as well as a couple of former National teammates -- Adam Yurchick and Todd Anderson -- I was curious what his plan would be for this draft. Would he force the archetype that served him so well yesterday?


"I don't like forcing. I try to take what I am passed," said Haibing after the draft. He opened a pack and did not see anything he liked better than a card that has been around even longer than he has -- [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire). He took an [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) with his second pick and then was faced with a dilemma for pick three.

Having passed an [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) to take the Vampire, Hu wanted to avoid blue if at all possible but when he was passed a third pick [Sphinx of Uthuun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Uthuun) he could not pass it.


"I had to jump into blue for the Sphinx and I am pretty sure I had already put players to my left into blue," explained Hu who was willing to be cut off in one direction on the color. "I would rather take a signal from the player passing me two packs. Plus Sphinx is really good."


Hu added a [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Bloodrage Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire), and [Manalith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manalith) to his growing pile of cards and when his opening pack made its way back to him he found [Drifting Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifting+Shade) waiting.


"I was pretty sure I was getting cut from blue," said Hu of the way pack two played out when he opened on [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) and then was passed [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gideon+Jura)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura)
He agonized between the Gideon and either [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) or [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) before ultimately dipping his toe into white to test the waters.


"I was pretty sure I was still going to be blue but if I got passed [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) and Griffins..." Hu explained of his Planeswalker pick. "Besides I can never beat this card. All the blue and black cards in the pack were pretty much the same and I was pretty sure one of them would come back.


He was right, as both the [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) in his opening pack, and the one he took Gideon over came back to him. He also picked up a late [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) as well.


Pack three started off with [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) and then he took the first of three [Vampire Outcasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Outcasts). "Black was definitely open by the third pack," said Hu, who rounded out the draft with [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) and a couple of fliers.
