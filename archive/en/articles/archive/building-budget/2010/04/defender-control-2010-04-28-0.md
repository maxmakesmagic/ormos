Defender Control

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Last week we [explored the possibility](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/sovereigns-found-conscription-2010-04-21) of a white-blue [Eldrazi Conscription](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Conscription) deck. This week I'd like to take a look at a fun new deck made possible with the inclusion of *Rise of the Eldrazi*. Walls—in more recent times, creatures with defender—have, historically, not been the most exciting cards around. That all changed with the release of *Rise of the Eldrazi*, though. Now there are enough exceptionally powerful defenders to give your aggressive opponents anuerisms.


A defender deck may have some issues with control decks, but any matchup where your opponent plans on attacking you with creatures should be a cakewalk. [Vent Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vent+Sentinel) provides us with an excellent win condition. [Perimeter Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perimeter+Captain) makes attacking very hard for our opponents. [Wall of Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Reverence) gives us breathing room. [Rage Nimbus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+Nimbus) chows down on every two power creature your opponent has. And [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) ... is [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens), which is pretty impressive.

I was working on red-white-blue defender deck last week. However, I was stumbling with my mana too much and I gave up on the archetype. I was scouring the internet this weekend looking for new decks with Rise of the Eldrazi when I happened upon John Ashe's Red-White Defender Control deck. I loved every facet of the deck and felt compelled to build it immediately.


Here is John's list for reference:

There's so much to love about this deck. [Vent Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vent+Sentinel), for example, essentially has a nice "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif), ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif):Destroy target planeswalker." ability that can really frustrate a lot of decks. [Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar) kills [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel)s and lives to tell the tale. Look at the removal suite: Four [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), which are pretty good by all accounts. Four [Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash)—this card may be new, but 4 damage is a lot for one mana. Killing Wooly Thoctar for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) seems like a pretty good deal to me. I feel like the most exciting part of [Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash) is its ability to kill a [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) or [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos) after my opponent sinks all their mana into equipping it with [Behemoth Sledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Behemoth+Sledge) (albeit after probably getting hit by it once). "Four is *usually* the magic number, sir!"

This deck has obvious issues with White-Blue Control decks that play a full four copies of [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). Luckily, [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) is becoming less popular as people realize just how insane the blockers in the format can be. This deck has the potential to become tier one if people start leaving their [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment)s in the sideboard.


I'll start by explaining the purpose of each card in the deck.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab88_theCardsHeader.jpg)  
**[Rage Nimbus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+Nimbus):** I was lucky enough to have this card in a draft on Prerelease weekend. The day after said draft I was talking about how good this card was for me. AJ Sacher asked what the card did. I described the card, and AJ responded, "Omph, omph, omph." I couldn't have worded it better myself. [Rage Nimbus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+Nimbus) chows down on each and every creature your opponent controls with 2 or less power. A lot of time you don't even need to kill the creature you force into attacking. The extra life netted by [Perimeter Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perimeter+Captain) makes it all worthwhile. [Rage Nimbus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+Nimbus)'s 5 power makes it an exceptionally strong partner to your [Wall of Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Reverence). You get a nice 5 life bonus even if your opponent has the [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) for your [Wall of Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Reverence). John only chose to play with two copies of [Rage Nimbus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+Nimbus). I think it probably has more value than that, so I'm going to try playing with a full four copies.


**[Perimeter Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perimeter+Captain):** Imagine playing with a red deck when your opponent plays this defender on turn one. [Perimeter Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perimeter+Captain) is a card straight out of *Rise of the Eldrazi* that happened to be printed in *Worldwake*. It's important to remember that [Perimeter Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perimeter+Captain) triggers whenever any creature you control with defender blocks. If your opponent attacks with a 3/3, you can happily block with four different defenders and net 8 life. This card cements our aggro matchups very well, and I'll be happy to have four copies in the maindeck.


**[Wall of Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Reverence):** I have a lot of fond memories playing with [Wall of Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Reverence). I had a copy in my first draft deck at [Pro Tour–Kyoto](/en/events/coverage/nassif-greater-power) last year and I was really impressed with its ability to win games entirely on its own. I had many opponents with huge cluttered boards that just couldn't dream of racing this Wall. [Wall of Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Reverence) is nice because it forces your opponent to deal with your board immediately. It seems like [Wall of Reverence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Reverence) is excellent bait for [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). There are also times when your opponent doesn't have a mass removal spell. Those are the times I would like to have the most.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab88_theCardsCross1.jpg)  
**[Vent Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vent+Sentinel):** Ah, a win condition. [Vent Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vent+Sentinel) does a lot for its cost. It can tap to kill virtually any planeswalker (Except maybe [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) or [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant), but those just take two activations.) It's also important to note just how fast these can kill your opponent. There are a lot of times where you have four or more Walls on the battlefield with this deck. [Vent Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vent+Sentinel) is a pretty vicious clock. The fact that you can safely leave him out of combat and use your other walls to do the dirty work is pretty impressive. He also does a fine job of blocking [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), if there is one thing that is never a bad incidental, it is the ability to safely and profitably block a [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf).


**[Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens):** I could easily write 2500 words about how awesome this card is. If you'd like to read that, you can click [here](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/good-omens-2010-04-07). As awesome as [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) is in every other deck, it's a lot better in this monstrosity. It makes your [Vent Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vent+Sentinel)s more powerful. It gains you some life with [Perimeter Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perimeter+Captain). It forces your opponent to overcommit into an [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake). I can't say enough about how strong this card is in this deck and just about every other. If you haven't gotten your hands on four of this, then I strongly recommend you do so. [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) are super plentiful with all this *Rise of the Eldrazi* product recently opened. This isn't just a Standard card—this is going to see play in Block, Extended, and even Legacy. It is a slam dunk to pick these up now.


**[Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar):** I've always had the hots for Chandra. This deck can have some trouble dealing with cards like [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel). [Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar) handles the ***Magic** 2010* monster with ease, and lives to tell the tales. Chandra is especially exciting in a deck like this because we have such an easy time defending her. I have a lot of trouble imagining games where I won't be able to simply tick up Chandra and fire a 10-damage blast at my opponent and their whole team. I've always been a big fan of playing Chandra in sideboards. It has a lot of loyalty and it forces your opponent to be more aggressive than they would like to be. John played three copies of Chandra, but I'm going to play a full four. [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant) and [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant) are both out of range for this column. I don't think of this as a downgrade, though. Chandra is about as good as it gets on the top end.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab88_theCardsCross2.jpg)  
**[Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt):** Three damage for one mana at instant speed. It's pretty safe to say that any deck with early access to red mana will want to play a full four of this card. I know I have absolutely no issue with that.


**[Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash):** This one is a little harder to judge. I love [Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash), but I worry about the new [Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) Decks. I would really like a few copies of [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) and Journey to nowhere. I don't want to mess with this deck's curve too much, so I'll stick with the [Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash). I'll be sure to include some copies of [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) and [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere) in my sideboard, though. I don't want to be out in the cold when my opponent drops an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) onto the battlefield.


**[Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake):** Here's the best card in the deck. I've been a big proponent of [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) in Standard for awhile now. This deck really gets full value out of it. The high toughness of all our creatures makes [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) a one-sided board sweeper. Our deck has enough in the way of life gain to make the damage done to us by [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) almost irrelevent. The incidental damage dealt to our opponent is a nice bonus, though. An [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) will often make us have to activate our [Vent Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vent+Sentinel) one less time than we would have had to otherwise. It can also kill planeswalkers, which will be very important in Standard. This is a must-have four-of in this deck.


**The mana base:** John plays with [Kabira Crossroads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabira+Crossroads) and [Arid Mesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa)s. [Arid Mesa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) can be a bit hard to come by, but if you happen to have any then they can easily replace [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) or [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse). [Kabira Crossroads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabira+Crossroads) enters the battlefield tapped. That may not seem like too big a deal, but I don't think the 2 extra life is very necessary. This deck has enough life gain already, and I'm not sure I want to have hiccups on my mana curve. I think I'd be more apt to play more copies of [Jungle Shrine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Shrine) before I would want any of that.

**[Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring):** This is a nice catch-all. The deck doesn't have a huge problem with planeswalkers, but I'd like some extra insurance in that department. [Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) decks are also a huge problem of the new metagame. [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) targets when it enters the battlefield, so it can remove [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) after they plop it down (and if they're [Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph)ing rather than casting, they won't get that extra turn).


**[Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere):** Another great card for fighting cheated [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn)s, Journey also does a great job of dealing with utility creatures like [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab88_theSideBoardCross1.jpg)  
**[Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion):** This is some awesome tech that I'm stealing from John's list. [Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion) can wipe out a lot of opponents, and it has the nice bonus of leaving a huge Hellion on the table. I was first introduced to the power of this card when I was practicing for U.S. Nationals against the Jund Mannequin deck that Conley Woods designed. I would be pretty far ahead in a lot of games, then Brad Nelson would draw a [Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion) and I would no longer have any shot of winning the game. This card can simply dominate games, and I think it deserves the slot in the sideboard.


**[Magma Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Phoenix):** Here's a card that hasn't seen much play yet. [Magma Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Phoenix) seems like it could be very good depending on how things shake out in the new metagame. I like the idea of a threat that provides card advantage and inevitability against the White-Blue Control decks. [Magma Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Phoenix) works especially hard in those matchups because it can deal with the [Martial Coup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martial+Coup) tokens your opponent creates after they wipe your board. I think this is an underrated card that deserves some play.


**[Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire):** The White-Blue Control decks will have a lot of trouble with all the incidental damage we do after sideboard. [Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire) gives us a pretty sweet finisher.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/theCardsFooter.jpg)  
Here's the final list for the sideboard:


 4 [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)  
 3 [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere)  
 3 [Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion)  
 3 [Magma Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Phoenix)  
 2 [Banefire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banefire)


I hope you all enjoyed my take on the Defender Control deck originally designed by John Ashe. This is a fun new strategy, and I strongly recommend you sleeve it up and take it to your local tournament. You won't be disappointed.


Happy brewing!
