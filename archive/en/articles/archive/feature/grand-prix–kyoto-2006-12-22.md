Mark Poole began working in the gaming industry in 1991 two years before **Magic: The Gathering** came out. Up until then he had painted illustrations for TSR and *Dragon* magazine. At the same time he had published his own line of fantasy/wildlife prints which were marketed world-wide

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/2007/gpkyoto07_artist_poole.jpg)Mark was approached to illustrate a card game in late 1992. At the time the assignment was kind of on hold to see if it was still going to get the funding necessary to produce. When he got the go-ahead Mark painted 26 cards for the first set of **Magic: The Gathering** collectable card game. Some of the cards that stand out from the set include [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine), [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance), and [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall). Since that time he has painted well over 100 cards and continues to do so. He was thrilled to do the lastest version of [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) 2 (as a prize for the Vintage Championship), [Restore Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance), [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) (which looks a lot like the old [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), and [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision).) 

Mark has done work for many other gaming companies and games over the years, including Alderac Entertainment (L5R and Warlords), White Wolf Studios (Vampire, Promethean, and the World of Darkness line), Doomtow, Anachronism, Upper Deck, Warcraft, Shadowfist, LOTR, Moral Kombat, and many others both in the fantasy/sci fi and mundane sector of graphic design and illustration.

Mark is currently working on a graphic novel which he hopes to debut some of the pages at this year's San Diego Comic Con along with more of his larger lithographs he is constantly working on. Some of his recent work can be seen at his website [markpoolartist.com](http://www.markpooleartist.com).

Mark is also an accomplished bass guitar musician who has been recorded on over 10 albums and used to tour up and down the East Coast before Art took over his life. Now he resides in South Carolina with his wife and two kids who life in the house while Mark dwells deep inside his cave under the house and only comes up for food and dices every now and then.
