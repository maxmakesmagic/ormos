 Looking at the standard decks here in Moscow and talking to some of the players, it becomes more and more clear that four contenders battle for the title of best deck in Standard. Until **Magic** 2015, and the rotation this fall, the top players seem to agree that the decks to beat this weekend are Black Devotion, with a splash of green, Blue White Control, Red White Burn and the rather newly tuned Jund Monster deck.




 Neither of the decks may be strangers to Standard veterans, but for those not as familiar I thought I'd introduce the decks that we think are the top contenders for the trophy at Grand Prix Moscow. And since my own reference these days is from **Magic Online**, this is were I will find some of the lists, rather than only from a recent Grand Prix.




 First things first. The Black devotion deck has been a thing in standard even since Kentarou Yamamoto made the top 8 of Pro Tour *Theros* in Dublin in October last year. His deck, although strong at he time, may look like an ancient fossile from an entire season ago. But in fact a lot of the cards remain the same, although the most succesful decks now splash Green, with the release of [Temple of Malady](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Malady) in *Journey into Nyx*.
