This bit of Arcana is well-known by older players, but it's such a goody that it deserves mention here.

The first version of [Sage Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl) (from *Weatherlight*) was illustrated by Mark Poole. Mark had illustrated another, more famous, blue card and decided to pay it respects in [Sage Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl). The card? The original version of [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). The painting in the background of Sage Owl is in fact of the same guy that is having his spell countered on [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).
