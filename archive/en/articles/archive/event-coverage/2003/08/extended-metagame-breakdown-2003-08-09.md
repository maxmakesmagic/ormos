The Extended Metagame at Worlds was not quite what it was hyped up to be. To hear the talk leading up to the event, [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) would be played at every table, and the team that had the best-teched version would walk away with Day 3. The reality was that the Extended environment was nearly as wide open as it was in Houston. Below is a breakdown of the decktypes that were played.

**Goblins – 78**

![Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Warchief)If you thought Extended Goblins were ridiculous before, you should see them after the release of *Scourge*. [Goblin Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief) speeds up the whole works, while Lackeying out a [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander) is a sickening turn two. The actual configuration of men varies from build to build. In fact, this number is a little misleading, containing a couple of Red Deck Wins, and also [the sensational Gob-Vantage](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/extended-get-gob-vantage-2003-08-08) from the members of Japanese Team Fireball.**Reanimator – 36**

This number incorporates both YMG's signature "Benzo" deck as well as the more popular European version played by the likes of Kai Budde. The latter touches blue for [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and [Gilded Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake). Maindeck [Contamination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contamination) frustrated opponents all weekend. [Verdant Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) on the second turn tends to outclass even the bustiest Goblins openings. Ditto for Akroma.

**Rock – 28**

The old standby, Rock plays the disruption game, packing Walls of Blossoms and Deeds against decks with men, and a wicked suite of hand destruction for anything else. Victory is usually an arduous journey of card advantage, but against a varied field, its players say, it's top notch. Jeroen Remie was playing this deck, to no-one's surprise, since it helped him to a Top 8 at Houston at the start of this season.

**[Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) – 26**

![Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mind%27s+Desire)Ah, the boogeyman. The deck keys off "free" spells like [Snap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap), [Cloud of Faeries](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) and [Frantic Search](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search), netting mana thanks to a discount from [Sapphire Medallion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion). With [Merchant Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll)s, [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) and [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) for draw power, it usually has no trouble getting off a quick [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) for six or more. That's usually all she wrote. The kill comes either from flipping up a maindeck [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), or from [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)ing for [Brain Freeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze), decking the opponent. Last year's champion, Carlos Romao, was seen working this intricate jigsaw puzzle**[Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) – 22**

These Extended [Gush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gush)-A-Tog decks kill fast, really fast. Between [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Gush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gush) the trip to a 20/21 'Tog is much shorter than you'd expect. Add to that good hand disruption and countermagic and you have the recipe for a winning deck. Unfortunately, it might find itself too slow against something like Reanimator.

**[Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) – 20**

Played by Bob Maher, Jr. to a first-place finish at the last Master's Series, [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) decks are capable of some stupidly explosive draws. Between [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), [Mishra's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix), [Phyrexian Processor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor) and [Crumbling Sanctuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary), they have the tools to destroy any matchup. The only downside is the deck's lack of homogeneity. If its first threats are dealt with, [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) can find itself pleading for a topdeck.

**Angry Hermit – 18**

![Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hermit+Druid)The Dutch masterpiece that thrilled Houston also got a touch-up after *Scourge* in an unlikely card: [Dragon Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Breath). Now the deck didn't need to run a mountain and [Anger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger) in order to have a hasty Ghoul swinging for the win. Some versions went even farther, and packed [Dragon Tyrant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Tyrant) and [Dragon Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Shadow) for extra zaniness. If the Hermit falls to burn, the deck can still function as a Reanimator with bad mana, which can often be enough.**Blue-Green – 15**

First it was Block, then Standard, and finally Extended. It's just hard to argue with the power of [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Mix in [Waterfront Bouncer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waterfront+Bouncer) and [Gilded Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), and you have some serious unfairness on tap. Perhaps tellingly, the God of Blue-Green, Jeff Cunningham, chose to run with the red men instead.

**Enchantress – 10**

Motokiyo Azuma brought this deck to prominence when he won Grand Prix – Hiroshima with it. Since then Gabriel Nassif used it to waltz to the finals of the Yokohama Masters. Comboing off an Enchantress, [Words of Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Words+of+Wind), and [Serra's Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra%27s+Sanctum) along with [Frantic Search](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search), the deck can leave an opponent permanentless before they know it.

**White Weenie with Blue – 9**

Pedigreed after Fiends, but without the too-painful three-tone manabase, this White Weenie deck still gets the power of the mighty [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage). [Ramosian Sergeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramosian+Sergeant) serves up [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder)s with ease, and [Savannah Lions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions) finally find a place they can call home. [Parallax Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) is an utter elbow against creature decks.

**[Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) – 4**

![Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aluren)Despite falling out of favor since Houston, [Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) still finds a few players willing to give it a try. The kill is even easier with [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) in the Environment, because a [Cavern Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+Harpy) can bounce itself to get instant Storm action.**Mono-Black Aggro – 4**

Efficient beaters, discard and [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll). What more could you want?

**Other - 41**

Some of the lesser-played decks include [Solitary Confinement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement), Fiends, TurboLand, [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco)-Explosion, Rector-Pattern, [Battle of Wits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits), Oath, Ponza, [Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life), and [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack).
