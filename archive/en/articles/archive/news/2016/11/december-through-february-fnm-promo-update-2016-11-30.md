It's almost December, so it's time to announce the promos that Friday Night *Magic* players can look forward to over the next three months. They are shiny, and soon they can all be yours.


**December**


It's the holidays, so make sure you call your bloodline—er, family. Olivia Voldaren is already on top of it with hers. Give yours a call, then show up at a Friday Night *Magic* in December to pick up a copy of [Call the Bloodline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Bloodline). Your grandmother will appreciate it.

**January**


Speaking of effective ways to utilize madness, [Noose Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor) is one of the better ones around. This [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) update has been used in a number of powerful tournament decks to block fliers, put cards in the graveyard, and just generally serve as a menacing Snake.

**February**


In February, attend an FNM and then pick a hand, any hand—no, not that hand. The other one. In it you'll find this promo version of [Fortune's Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune%27s+Favor) by Grzegorz Rutkowski, whose art is as fantastic as his name is difficult to spell.
