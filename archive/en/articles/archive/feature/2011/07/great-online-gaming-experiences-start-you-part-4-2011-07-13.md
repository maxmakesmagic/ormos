So far, we’ve covered protecting your personal information (see [Part 1](/en/articles/archive/great-online-gaming-experiences-start-you-part-1-2011-06-22)), avoiding outside scams (see [Part 2](/en/articles/archive/great-online-gaming-experiences-start-you-part-2-2011-06-29)), and safe trading (see [Part 3](/en/articles/archive/great-online-gaming-experiences-start-you-part-3-2011-07-06)). This week, we’re concluding our series with some general tips to help you protect your account. 


**Is It an “Official” E-mail?**


If you receive an e-mail that looks like it’s from Wizards of the Coast, first take the time to check the address it was sent from. Does it come from a “@wizards.com” address? If not, then it is not an official Wizards e-mail. 


Be suspicious of any e-mail that asks for your password or offers you free cards. You can forward these to [spoof@wizards.com](mailto:spoof@wizards.com) or report them via our [Report Suspicious Activity](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1236/kw/suspicious%20behavior) system. Most official communications from Wizards of the Coast can be found in your Customer Services Help Account. If you are unsure whether or not a message is legitimate, check your account first. Once you’ve logged in, your recent messages will be visible on the “My Stuff” tab. 


**Don’t Sell/Share Accounts**


Sometimes fraudsters attempt to purchase old accounts in order to appear more legitimate. If someone offers you money for an account that you aren’t using, or asks you to create a new account for them, don’t do it. **Magic Online** accounts belong to the person who purchases them, and are not transferrable. As such, you are responsible for all activity conducted on any account you have created. If someone uses an account that belongs to you in order to scam others, you may be held responsible. This could lead to the loss of your account(s). Additionally, providing a fraudster with a used account may also give them access to your order history and lead to the theft of your personal information. 


**Report Suspicious Behavior**


Scammers are always evolving and looking for new ways to take advantage of players and exploit game systems. Always remain cautious of questionable trades and avoid participating in actions that may get you in trouble, such as accepting free product. If you witness suspicious behavior, or you feel you have been the victim of any of the scams we’ve discussed in this series, [report it](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1236/kw/suspicious%20behavior%20) to the Wizards Fraud Team so that we can begin an investigation and ensure scammers are disciplined. 


This concludes our series. We hope that the information we have provided you will be useful in the prevention of becoming a victim of fraud. We aim to make sure players and fans have great play experiences and, together, we can continue to build a strong **Magic Online** community. You can discuss this article, and all the articles in this series, with other **Magic** players and our Fraud Team specialists by visiting our [Wizards Community](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75850/27799749/Useful_Info?sdb=1%20).
