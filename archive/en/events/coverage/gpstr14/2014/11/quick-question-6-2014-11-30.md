***Patrick Dickmann:** Mardu. Those aggressive Warror decks are so strong. And all the mass pump effects—[Rush of Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Battle), [Raiders' Spoils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raiders%27+Spoils)—are insane in the deck.*

***Willy Edel:** I like Blue-Green plus whatever. I love delve and prefer Sultai. But I'm happy with Temur too.*

***Fabrizio Anteri:** Jeskai.*

***Martin Jůza:** Temur. It's great!*
