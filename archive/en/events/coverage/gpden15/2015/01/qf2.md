 Hall of Famer, William "Huey" Jensen needs little introduction. A staggering five Pro Tour Top 8s and eighteen Grand Prix Top 8s make Jensen one of the most decorated *Magic* players in history. This weekend is just a bit more icing on the cake that is Jensen's long and illustrious *Magic* career.



His opponent is a new-comer, but his short career is already quite impressive. Valentin Mackl's first Grand Prix Top 8 was just last Summer, and this weekend marks his fifth trip into the elimination rounds. 



 The first game was an attrition war where neither player could seem to get any footing as every threat traded with a removal spell. Mackl's [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) presented a unique threat, though, and Jensen would need to find an answer quickly. [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) came down for Jensen, but Mackl quickly trumped it with a [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) with the raid trigger. Jensen had fallen too far behind and, with nothing relevant left in his hand, he was forced to move on to the second game.
