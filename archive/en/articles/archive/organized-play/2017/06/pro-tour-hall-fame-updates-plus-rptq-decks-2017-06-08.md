We've got some Regional Pro Tour Qualifier Top 8 Draft decklists for you today, but first, a little update on the Pro Tour Hall of Fame.


Pro Tour Hall of Fame 2017 Updates
==================================


Ballots for this year's [Pro Tour Hall of Fame](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/hall-fame-top-players-coverage-events) will be going out at the end of the month. We're taking this opportunity to also update some of the rules regarding which players are eligible to appear on the ballot as well as what percentage of the vote a player needs to be inducted into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame.


First up are the following tweaks to eligibility, effective *this year*:


* The player must have at least two final-day finishes to have their name on the 2016 Hall of fame selection ballot

This change is being made to reflect a lot of the selection committee and greater community's thresholds in voting for eligible candidates. A final-day finish is defined as either an individual Pro Tour Top 8, a Team Pro Tour Top 4, or a Top 4 in a World Championship event dating back to 2012. This will be in addition to the requirements that a player have at least 150 lifetime Pro Points and played in their first Pro Tour at least ten seasons ago.


We'll also be modifying the rules for when a player gets removed from the Hall of Fame selection ballot, *effective next year*, to the following:


* If a player receives votes on less than ten percent of the returned, unweighted ballots for three years of voting, that player shall be removed from the Hall of Fame selection ballot until they requalify pursuant of the process of receiving 4 Professional Points during the set period a year's selection ballot looks at.

This a change from the previous rules for selection ballot removal, in which a player needs to receive less than ten percent of the returned, unweighted ballots for three *consecutive* years to be removed from the ballot. This change would not go into effect until *next year's* voting period, meaning we will not be removing any names that currently fall within this rule from 2016's ballot.


The final change we will be making to Pro Tour Hall of Fame is what percentage of the returned, unweighted ballot an eligible player needs to be voted in. The previous threshold was set at 40%. Effective this year, *that threshold will be increased to 60%*.


In the last few years, we've seen a growing number of selection committee participants using fewer than the maximum of five votes that they are allowed to cast. While selection committee members will continue to be allowed to use *up to* five votes, it was clear that the reason for many not using all their votes was due to what was a relatively low threshold of votes needed to induct a player into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame. Casting fewer votes was done as a means to make the Hall of Fame more exclusive, and we saw this more and more with increasing frequency each year because the system was not at a place to support those ideals.


In increasing the threshold required to be inducted into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame, and by adjusting the eligibility requirements to create a more exclusive list, it is our expectation that focusing on a smaller field of eligible players will create healthy discussions as well as celebrations of the careers of the game's best.


Regional Pro Tour Qualifier Top 8 Draft Decklists
