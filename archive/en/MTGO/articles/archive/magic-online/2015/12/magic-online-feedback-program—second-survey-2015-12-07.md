Welcome to the second survey in our new Feedback Program! The first survey asked you about *Magic Online* Prerelease events, if you missed it, you can see the results of the first survey [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-feedback-results%E2%80%94survey-one-2015-11-23).

This month’s survey dives in to Play Points and Leagues. The introduction of Play Points on August 12th created a big change for many *Magic Online* players. Now that players have had several months to use Play Points, we want to hear your thoughts! Have we met our [goals](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/august-2015-constructed-event-changes-2015-07-20) with the introduction of Play Points?


Perhaps the other biggest change to *Magic Online* this year was the launch of Constructed Leagues. We’ve gotten lots of positive feedback on Leagues but would like to ask a few specific questions to help us make Leagues even better.


We expect this survey to take about 5 to 10 minutes. So if you’re ready, click [here](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2438180/MTGO-Monthly-Survey-2) to take the survey!


As a reminder, if you are having any issues with *Magic Online* that you need help with or want to discuss, the best thing to do is to [contact game support](https://company.wizards.com/contact-us). If you'd like to give feedback outside of these surveys you can email us [here](mailto:magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com?). And if you've experienced a bug or have another issue to report please do so [here](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-reimbursement-requests-and-bug-reporting).
