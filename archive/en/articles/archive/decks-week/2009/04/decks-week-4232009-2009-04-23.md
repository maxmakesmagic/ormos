While the Pro Tour Qualifier season featuring the Extended format may have come to a close, there was one final premier-level event waiting to be played: Grand Prix–Kobe! Former Player of the Year Tomoharu Saito managed to take the title, making it back-to-back Grand Prix championships for the Japanese star. His deck of choice? The tried and true Zoo list he used to win just a few weeks earlier! Check out the Top 8 lists below, or [read the full Grand Prix–Kobe coverage](/en/events/coverage/saito%E2%80%99s-back-back).


Naturally there's still plenty of **Magic** deck lists going around. You'll find plenty of Premier Event Top 8s featuring all your favorite formats. What's big in Standard? And how about in *Shards of Alara* Block Constructed? Pro Tour–Honolulu, just around the bend, features that format prominently and will certainly be informed by what the denizens of **Magic Online** have managed to come up with!


And of course, *Alara Reborn* is almost here! Make sure to check out a [local prerelease near you](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts) this weekend for a sneak peek at the set before it's available for sale!
