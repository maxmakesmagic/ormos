**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Jeskai Black. Sammy T. told me the deck was great.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  

Obviously Jace. The card is busted and this is the best Jace deck. Shoutouts to [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pia+and+Kiran+Nalaar) though for being insane in the mirror.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  

Probably [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command), versatile card advantage engine.

Jake Mondello's Eldrazi Ramp deck.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?**  

Wouldn't mind a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) or two in the 75 somewhere.

**Age:** 28 (it's my birthday!)


**Hometown:** Ottawa, ON


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

GP Vancouver Champion 2015, Canadian National Champion 2008


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

Dark Jeskai. I feel it's the best deck and it suits my play style.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy). It's the best card in the format, and the reason that the deck is playable.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence). It swings creature matchups that are otherwise tough to beat.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?**  

Red-Black Dragons? Nothing was very surprising.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?**  

I wish I had [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) in my sideboard, but I'm unsure what I'd cut to accomodate it.

**Age:** 22


**Hometown:** Here!


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

9 GP Top 8's now.


**What did you play this weekend, and why?**  

4-Color [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors), because I had no idea what to play and it seemed well-positioned.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**  
[Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter). It does everything you need.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  
[Merciless Executioner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner) / [Fleshbag Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshbag+Marauder), since it's the only sideboard card that doesn't make my deck bad.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?**  

The mirror match.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?**  

I would try to shave a few [Grim Haruspex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Haruspex), but I have no idea what card I'd play instead.

Jace + [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) + Tasigur… There is no best card, it's the combination.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**  

I boarded all the cards, it's hard to say with the 1-of's.


**What was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?**  

Esper? I just played against the popular decks.


**If you could change one card anywhere in your deck what would it be and why?**  

-1 [Smoldering Marsh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoldering+Marsh), +1 [Sunken Hollow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Hollow)
