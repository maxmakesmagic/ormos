### Travel Information:


**HOW TO REACH**  
  
**TRAVEL BY CAR:**  

The city is positioned along the A14 motorway which connects it to Bologna and Milan going North and to Bari going South.  

The Riviera region has four motorway exits: Rimini Nord, Rimini Sud, Riccione and Cattolica. Using the A14 from Rimini you can easily reach the A4 which will take you to Venice and the A22 which heads towards the Brennero Pass.  

It is also very easy to reach the A1 which will take you to Florence, Rome, and Naples.  
  
**PUBLIC TRANSPORT:**  

A good [railway](http://www.trenitaliaplus.com/) network connects the RIMINI RIVIERA to the rest of Italy. There are train stations in Rimini, Riccione and Cattolica.  

From these stations, you can easily reach Bologna in an hour, Milan in 3 hours, Florence in just 2, and Rome in 4.  

Don't forget that in Italy you have to pass your train ticket through the machines to be valid  
  
**TRAVEL BY PLANE:**  

Federico Fellini's Airport is right nearby the city's hotels and convention centres. [Rimini International Airport](http://www.riminiairport.com/)  is connected with regular flights to Rome Fiumicino and other international airport.  
  
[Bologna International Airport](http://www.bologna-airport.it/)   

The airport in Bologna is approximately 100 km from Rimini by motorway and can be reached in an hour by train.  

Bologna International Airport has daily connections with all of the major Italian, European, and international cities throughout the world and is served by all of the major airlines.  
  

The low cost company Ryan air has daily flights to Bologna (Forli) airport which is 30 minutes by train to Rimini.  

Flying to Bologna and going further by train to Rimini will probably be the cheapest and easiest way to go.  

Because of the recent commotion surrounding "Alitalia's" potentially approaching bancrupcy we can not recommended flying with this airline, even though prices of alternative airlines have noticeably increased because of it.  
  
**THINGS TO SEE/DO:**  

Beach, discotheques, Sun, Italian food…What more to say?
