With just two more rounds to go, both players entered the fray with records of 11-1, still in good shape for a potential Top 8 berth. The winner of this match would maybe even be able to secure a spot early, while the loser wouldn't be eliminated from Top 8 contention either.



Austrian Bernhard Wurmitzer got this far with a stock version of the green-red Urzatron deck, while the Netherlands' Martin van der Vaart was playing a rather unusual deck, blue and red, built around [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer). In this match-up, he would be the aggressor trying to out-tempo Wurmitzer before Urza's Tower and Co. pump out big threats like [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) and [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated).



**Game 1**



The first game was marred by van der Vaart severe mana screw. While Wurmitzer wasn't particularly lucky either—his first five lands being Urza's Mine, [Grove of the Burnwillows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows), Urza's Tower, [Ghost Quarter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter), and [Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin)—van der Vaart never even found a second land after fetching [Steam Vents](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents). He got Wurmitzer down to about 10 with [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s, but then lost his Lavamancer as well as a freshly-summoned [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) to [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm).

"Kind of a lame game," Wurmitzer commented, and van der Vaart agreed, "I've seen better." Wurmitzer's draw step changed things, however. "That definitely is better," said Wurmitzer as he dropped the missing Urza's Power Plant, followed by Urza's planeswalker [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). Van der Vaart was reduced to zero lands and conceded.



**Game 2**



Here, van der Vaart opened better, on [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). [Insectile Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) and [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) quickly started the process of reducing Wurmitzer's life, who himself was once again struggling with his lands. After cycling various [Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star)s, Spheres, and Relics, [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) met van der Vaart's [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak).



Another [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and another attack already brought Wurmitzer to 4 when his [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) was met by [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). One more attack, and [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) evened the score at one apiece.



"Now, let's have one good game for a change," Wurmitzer suggested while shuffling. Van der Vaart reminded him, "Your draw in the second was way better than mine in the first, though."

**Game 3**



The early turns were all about van der Vaart's impressive array of counterspells: [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) stopped [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying), [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) stopped [Ancient Stirrings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings), [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) stopped another [Ancient Stirrings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings), and another [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) stopped [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm). Meanwhile, nothing stopped van der Vaart's turn-two [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and it surely looked as if [Insectile Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) would go all the way.



Then came the all-deciding turn: With Wurmitzer at 8, van der Vaart tapped out for [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to flashback [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), countering a second [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm). However, after that, Wurmitzer had another land drop—the missing Tron piece which allowed him to cast [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated).



Karn took out [Insectile Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) and died to [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), but now Wurmitzer's mana engine was active. Soon his [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) was active as well, and while van der Vaart put up much more of a fight than anyone would have expected at this point, he didn't have a real answer to the lifelink monster. Two [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer)s and another [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) could only make the game a close one, not close the game itself. Instead, a second and later a third [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) decided the game in Wurmitzer's favor.



"Good game," Wurmitzer concluded, after accepting the handshake, as he slumped back in his chair exhausted. Van der Vaart agreed. "A close one."
