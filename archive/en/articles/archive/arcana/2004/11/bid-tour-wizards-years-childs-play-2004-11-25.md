[Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org) is a charity organized by the guys behind the Penny Arcade online comic. Last year, gamers from around the world pitched in and donated over $250,000 in cash and toys to the Seattle Children's Hospital. This year Child's Play is expanding to help children's hospitals across the United States, and Wizards of the Coast is offering two chances to tour its facility and hang out with WotC R&D members as part of the Child's Play [fundraiser dinner auction](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=77032). The dinner auction will be held Thursday, December 9th in Bellevue, Washington. 


The details on the two tours:


### Tour of Wizards of the Coast (Magic)


Attention **Magic: the Gathering** fans! Have you ever dreamed of visiting the place where **Magic** is made? Curious to find out whose desk is messier, Mark Rosewater's or Randy Buehler's? Do you want to see for yourself if Richard Garfield really does roam the halls? How about testing your **Magic** playing skills against the people who make the game? Then Wizards of the Coast's **Magic: the Gathering** Experience is for you! 


Auction winner and a guest will enjoy a tour of the Wizards of the Coast corporate headquarters located in Renton, WA, lunch, and an opportunity to play against **Magic: the Gathering** R&D staff. 


### Tour of Wizards of the Coast (Dungeons & Dragons)


Attention **Dungeons & Dragons** fans! Have you ever dreamed of visiting the place where **D&D** is made? Curious to find out what strange monsters lurk inside Bill Slavicsek's office? Do you want to take a peek inside R&D's games library? How about actually playing **D&D** with the people who make the game? Then Wizards of the Coast's **Dungeons & Dragons** Experience is your dream come true! 


Auction winner and a guest will receive a tour of the Wizards of the Coast corporate headquarters located in Renton, WA, lunch, and an opportunity to game with **Dungeons & Dragons** R&D staff.
