 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized playâ€™s content specialist in June 2014. 






Looking to watch some *Magic* this weekend and beyond? We've got the scoop on where you can see some live *Magic*, whether it's part of a tournament series, a scheduled stream from one of the game's prominent streamers, or some new programming from a Hall of Famer (more on that in a minute).


While our text coverage teams bring you updates from Grand Prix Sydney and Grand Prix Kobe this weekend, NicoNico will also be broadcasting live video of Kobe's Modern action. Day One coverage begins at 9:00 a.m. local time/5 p.m. PT/12 a.m. Saturday GMT. Day Two coverage will begin at the same times.

The [StarCityGames.com Open Series](http://www.starcitygames.com/pages/scgop/open_series) continues its circuit across the United States with a stop in Washington DC this weekend. Join commentators Cedric Phillips and Gerry Thompson as they take you through two days of Constructed *Magic*. Saturday, August 22, will feature the Standard Open, while the Legacy Open takes center stage on Sunday!


Scheduled Twitch Streams
========================


In addition to the two streamed events happening this weekend, there are a few scheduled streams that will also be taking place this weekend that you can tune in to.


[NumotTheNummy on Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/numotthenummy)


Catch Kenji Egashira (aka NumottheNummy) on Twitch this Saturday morning at 8 a.m. PT/3 p.m. GMT, where he will be streaming his matches from the [*Magic Online *Vintage Masters**Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-championships-2014-07-14), taking place this weekend. Kenji and many more will be competing in a large invitation-only **Vintage Masters** Sealed Event (with Top 8 Booster Draft). The winner of this event receives a non-foil *and* a foil set of **Vintage Masters**on his or her *Magic Online* account!


[Paul Cheon on Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/haumph)


Paul Cheon, former Team World Champion for the United States and recent semifinalist from [Grand Prix Portland](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppor14), is also a regular streamer on Twitch.TV. You can catch Paul Cheon on Mondays at 8 p.m. PT/3 a.m. GMT on his Twitch channel, where he'll be battling in various formats and generally just enjoying *Magic*. Since he qualified for Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, Cheon will be streaming a little more regularly. So if you're looking for active *Magic* Twitch streamers to follow, keep your eyes on his channel for more activity!

And finally for this week, we wanted to spotlight a new initiative from Hall of Famer and long-time Vintage-format lover, [Randy Buehler](http://magic.wizards.com/en/top-players/hall-of-fame/randy-buehler).

The Vintage Super League is a new program that you can catch every Tuesday night at 7 p.m. PT/2 a.m. Wednesday GMT. Buehler will host and commentate a round-robin tournament series featuring ten players.


Each week, for the next nine weeks, the ten players will face off to see who brings the best game to the table. That means you'll be able to watch five matches of Vintage each week for nine weeks, until the cut to Top 4. The top six players at the end the season will get a chance to draft the Power Nine on *Magic Online* for the prize pool...but the real goal is to not finish dead last, as the player who ends up in 10th place in this tournament won't be invited back to the next season of the Vintage Super League!

From tournaments to popular streamers, there's a lot of *Magic* to watch over the next few days! Be sure to check them out and follow them for more action down the road!
