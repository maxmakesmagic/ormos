The [last time I did a quiz](/en/articles/archive/goblin-quiz-2013-05-21) it was very well received. So I'm here with another quiz today, this one talks about Planeswalkers!


Since I'm still figuring out what sort of questions work best for this sort of thing, let me know what you think! I've got a nice mixture of questions for this quick quiz, let me know which you like best and worst either [on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/trickmtg) or via the author email below!


**1. Who Am I?** If you take the first letter of each word in my name it spells out the first word of my name.  
  
*Difficulty: Easy*


[Reveal the answer](#)

**2. Six of a Kind** - There are six Planeswalkers with [0] cost abilities. Among them, what color isn't represented?  
  
*Difficulty: Medium*


[White](#) - WRONG Nope, both [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) and [Gideon, Champion of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Champion+of+Justice) have zero activation abilities.


[Blue](#) - WRONG Sorry, not here either. [Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept) mills a player for ten cards and of course [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) allows you to [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) for zero.


[Black](#) - WRONG  [Sarkhan the Mad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+the+Mad) reveals the top card for zero.


[Red](#) - WRONG  [Sarkhan the Mad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+the+Mad) reveals the top card for zero.


[Green](#) - WRONG  [Garruk Relentless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Relentless) has only zero activation abilities.


[None](#) - Correct!  [Sarkhan the Mad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+the+Mad) covers red and black, [Garruk Relentless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Relentless) is green, and then Gideon and Jace are white and blue respectively.

**3. Sword play** - Other than Elspeth, who is the only other Planeswalker to hold a sword in their card art?  
  
*Difficulty: Vorthos*


[Reveal the answer](#)


![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sorin,%20Lord%20of%20Innistrad&options=)

**4. Jumble** - If you shuffle this Planeswalker’s name it spells out: SUNS RETAKE HAVEN.  
  
*Difficulty: Medium*


[Reveal the answer](#)

**5. Spend Wisely** - [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker) was introduced in Conflux, costing ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif). A wise investor diversifies, so if you were to instead spend exactly that mana, which other two Planeswalkers could you cast in one turn?  
  
*Difficulty: Hard*
