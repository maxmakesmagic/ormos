In the **Magic: The Gathering** marketing archives are some classic **Magic** TV commercials. For Throwback Week we thought we'd resurrect one of these commercials in Magic Arcana. 


You might have seen the [Orgg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orgg) squashing Bob from Accounting in [this spot](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/ads/MTG_Commercial_Orgg.zip) (6.7 MB Zipped MOV).

You'll need [Quicktime](http://www.quicktime.com) and an [unzip utility](http://www.winzip.com) to see the commercial.
