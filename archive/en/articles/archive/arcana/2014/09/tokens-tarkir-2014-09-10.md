Every second Wednesday of previews, we like to use this space in the Arcana to show off the tokens of the latest set. And we're definitely going to do that today. But one of the tokens is a little bit different. One of the tokens isn't really a token at all—it's something we've been calling an overlay.


Want to see it?

This card, which you can and will get in the token slot of booster packs of *Khans of Tarkir*, is meant to make morph much more manageable. When you play a morph, you can slide one of these cards on top of it to remind everyone exactly what that face-down card represents—and that its actual identity is shrouded in a giant ball of magical energies.


It also serves as a reminder at-a-glance that morphs (1) are creatures; (2) are colorless; and (3) always, always, always have a base power and toughness of 2/2.


This is the part where I say, "But wait, there's more!" Because there is more. Although you don't particularly have to wait.


First, we have ten new tokens for *Khans of Tarkir*. Let's go color by color.


First up, white.

White showcases a 3/4 flying Bird to go with Wingmate Roc, a 1/1 flying Spirit that can be made with Abzan Ascendancy, and two—yes two—Warrior tokens that can be made by (among other things) Mardu Charm.

Next up is black, although we're going to cheat a little bit and throw in the only multicolor token in *Khans of Tarkir*—the mighty Spirit Warrior!

Vampires (as we've already seen) come from Sorin, Solemn Visitor. Zombies are spit out en masse by Empty the Pits and a few at a time by Sidisi, Brood Tyrant. As for a certain Spirit Warrior? You'll just have to wait and see...

The final batch of tokens (but not the final item we're showing off) has some...well...interesting red and green fellows.

The goblin art for this set is fantastic, and the token doesn't disappoint. You can create those easily with Mardu Ascendancy, while Hooded Hydra spits out Snakes. And, as you might know by now, Bear's Companion brings with him a better class of Bear—a 4/4. All the more impressive to punch.

Last, but certainly not least, we have two Planeswalkers in this set who both create emblems with their final abilities. Those emblems look like this:

And, naturally, the cards you'll be hoping to open in order to make such intimidating emblems:
