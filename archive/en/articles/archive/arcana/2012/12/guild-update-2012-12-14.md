It's time to check in on the guilds! Who's getting the most points? Who's getting the most members? Who, in short, is the best?

[Two weeks ago](/en/articles/archive/guild-update-2012-11-30), the standings looked like this:

### November 30, 2012



 **Guild** | **Points** | **Members** | **Points per Member** |
| Izzet | 1,437,914 | 10,679 | 134.65 |
| Azorius | 1,303,014 | 9,075 | 143.58 |
| Dimir | 881,329 | 7,004 | 125.83 |
| Simic | 837,130 | 5,676 | 147.49 |
| Golgari | 688,564 | 6,951 | 99.06 |
| Selesnya | 524,071 | 5,930 | 88.38 |
| Boros | 501,699 | 4,682 | 107.15 |
| Orzhov | 475,963 | 3,904 | 121.92 |
| Rakdos | 454,879 | 4,775 | 95.26 |
| Gruul | 262,272 | 1,933 | 135.68 |

  
And here's how things stand now:

### December 14, 2012



 **Guild** | **Points** | **Members** | **Points per Member** |
| Izzet | 1,642,469 | 10,963 | 149.82 |
| Azorius | 1,510,291 | 9,435 | 160.01 |
| Dimir | 1,026,037 | 7,386 | 138.92 |
| Simic | 959,376 | 5,992 | 160.11 |
| Golgari | 781,691 | 7,120 | 109.79 |
| Selesnya | 611,938 | 6,177 | 99.07 |
| Boros | 584,019 | 4,973 | 117.44 |
| Orzhov | 562,960 | 4,117 | 135.33 |
| Rakdos | 532,168 | 5,007 | 106.29 |
| Gruul | 312,036 | 2,104 | 148.31 |

  
There were a few shifts since two weeks ago but one of them was especially interesting: Gruul moves to #3 on Points per Member, knocking Izzet to #4! Who says you need blue to get ahead?
