Day 2 Coverage



Day 2 of Grand Prix Kyoto is now underway. Just 92 teams of three return today, with Che/Ding/Lu, and Sakuta/Matsumoto/Kawabata leading the way as the only 8-0 teams. Close behind was another Chinese team, Sun/He/Liu at 7-0-1, while there were also 19 teams at 7-1 and 9 teams at 6-1-1.


With just six more rounds of Standard, Modern, and Legacy to go, our Top 4 will be born soon! If you’re interested in watching the action live, do visit <https://www.twitch.tv/mtgjp>! By dusk, we expect to crown three brand new Grand Prix champions!







Day 1 Coverage



After eight rounds of Team Trios Constructed, the field of 757 teams was boiled down to just 92 teams of three! From among these returning teams were two trios at 8-0. These six players successfully entered Day 2 without a blemish on their record, and they were Che/Ding/Lu, and Sakuta/Matsumoto/Kawabata.


That was not to say that Day 2 would be a walk in the park.


Close behind was another Chinese team, Sun/He/Liu at 7-0-1, while there were also 19 teams at 7-1 and 9 teams at 6-1-1, ready to give chase and hopefully overtake. Some of the most prominent names include Takao/Inoue/Mihara (not Makihito, he’s in the booth this weekend for the very first time!), Hiram/Nakajima/Kurokawa, Kuroda/Yao/Omonishi, and Yamamoto/Yukuhiro/Ichikawa!


Thanks for staying with us all weekend! Six more rounds of Team Trios Constructed tomorrow will determine the Top 4 teams, and then a couple more matches will ensue before three Grand Prix champions are minted! If you’re interested in watching the action live, do visit <https://www.twitch.tv/mtgjp> to whet your appetite!
