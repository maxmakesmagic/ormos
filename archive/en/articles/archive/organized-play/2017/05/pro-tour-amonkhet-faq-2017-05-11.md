Pro Tour *Amonkhet* will kick off Friday at 9 a.m. local on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). By the time you read this, I'll already be in Nashville along with the rest of the coverage team. We'll be getting ready for three days of Booster Draft, Standard, feature matches, deck techs, draft viewers, metagame breakdowns, feature stories, pros, teams, tweets, and more as hundreds of the world's best players compete for their share of a quarter-of-a-million US dollars!


PRO TOUR *AMONKHET* BASICS
==========================


Watch all three days of Pro Tour *Amonkhet* on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)!


[Day 1](https://www.twitch.tv/events/7037) | [Day 2](https://www.twitch.tv/events/7038) | [Day 3](https://www.twitch.tv/events/7039)


Here's the general overview of Pro Tour *Amonkhet*:


* The Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring some of greatest *Magic* pros as well as top-finishing Grand Prix competitors, Hall of Famers, and players who found success in February's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers. Those players will be competing for a share of the $250,000 prize pool, with $50,000 going to the winner along with an invitation to the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship. Pro Tour *Amonkhet* is the third of four Pro Tours in the 2016–17 season.
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using three *Amonkhet* booster packs—and five rounds of Standard Constructed. All matches on Friday and Saturday are best-two-out-of-three games.
* The following sets are legal in Standard Constructed for this tournament: *Battle for Zendikar, Oath of the Gatewatch, Shadows over Innistrad, Eldritch Moon, Kaladesh, Aether Revolt*, and *Amonkhet*.
* The following cards are currently banned in Standard Constructed, and cannot be used by players: [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter); [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage); [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End); and most recently, [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian).
* This Pro Tour is part of the [Pro Tour Team Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/protour/teamseries) 2016–17 soft launch. At the end of this event, the Top 4 teams competing in the Team Series will receive invitations and airfare to compete in Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation* in Kyoto, Japan.
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of the first day will advance to Day Two of the competition.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a traditional single-elimination bracket.
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action.
* The winner gets $50,000, Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club (which will give that player invitations with airfare and appearance fees through the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons), and an invitation to compete in the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.
* The $250,000 prize pool pays down to 64th place, awarding a minimum of $1,000. In addition, all players with 33 or more match points at the end of the Pro Tour's Swiss rounds will receive an invitation to compete in the next Pro Tour.

That's the lowdown on what you need to know about the Pro Tour this weekend. For a more in-depth look at the stories of this Pro Tour, I highly recommend reading [Rich Hagon's Pro Tour preview](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-amonkhet-preview-2017-05-08).


Now, let's address a few of those other common questions.


WHEN DOES COVERAGE START?
=========================


You can watch every round of Pro Tour *Amonkhet* on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) Friday, Saturday, and Sunday beginning at 9 a.m. local time. Nashville, Tennessee, is playing host to the Pro Tour this weekend, meaning 9 a.m. local is Central Time. Here's what that means for you in terms of start times if you're in the following time zones:




| Time Zone | Day One | Day Two | Day Three |
| Pacific Time (PT) | 7 a.m. | 7 a.m. | 7 a.m. |
| Eastern Time (ET) | 10 a.m. | 10 a.m. | 10 a.m. |
| Central European Time (CET) | 4 p.m. | 4 p.m. | 4 p.m. |
| Japan Time (JST) | 11 p.m. | 11 p.m. | 11 p.m. |

If you can't watch the broadcast live, no worries! We'll be replaying the broadcast once each day concludes. And in addition to that, VODs (videos on demand) of each round and segment will be available on our Twitch page, with separate collections for both the matches as well as our deck techs and feature content!

WHEN WILL DECKLISTS BE PUBLISHED?
=================================


An always-popular question, perhaps even more than usual, Standard Constructed Top 8 decklists will be posted shortly after the Swiss rounds conclude on Saturday.


The rest of the top decklists, featuring all 6-4 or better decks, typically get posted no later than Sunday afternoon. Oftentimes these get published during the quarterfinals, so check back Sunday in the first few hours of the broadcast and visit the coverage page to see them once they're live!
