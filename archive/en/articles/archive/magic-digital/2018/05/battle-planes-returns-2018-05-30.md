Last year, to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of *Magic Online*, we ran a format called Battle of the Planes where you could choose a popular plane from *Magic*'s history, build a phantom Sealed deck from sets on that plane, and battle against other players doing the same. We've decided to bring it back for *Magic*'s 25th Anniversary!


From June 6â€“13 on *Magic Online*, you'll choose among the following five planes and get a phantom Sealed pool consisting of the boosters listed below. Build your deck, and then play three matches against other players doing the same. (Plane selection does not affect matchmaking; you could play against the same plane or another one.) Here are the planes you can select and which booster packs you'll receive:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Plane** | **Booster #1** | **Booster #2** | **Booster #3** | **Booster #4** | **Booster #5** | **Booster #6** |
| **Innistrad** | *Innistrad* | *Innistrad* | *Dark Ascension* | *Avacyn Restored* | *Shadows over Innistrad* | *Eldritch Moon* |
| **Lorwyn** | *Lorwyn* | *Lorwyn* | *Morningtide* | *Shadowmoor* | *Shadowmoor* | *Eventide* |
| **Mirrodin** | *Mirrodin* | *Darksteel* | *Fifth Dawn* | *Scars of Mirrodin* | *Mirrodin Besieged* | *New Phyrexia* |
| **Ravnica** | *Ravnica: City of Guilds* | *Guildpact* | *Dissension* | *Return to Ravnica* | *Gatecrash* | *Dragon's Maze* |
| **Zendikar** | *Zendikar* | *Zendikar* | *Worldwake* | *Rise of the Eldrazi* | *Battle for Zendikar* | *Oath of the Gatewatch* |

If you play multiple times, I highly suggest changing up planes. It's just more fun!


Here are the event details:


**Start Time**: June 6 at 10 a.m. PST  
**Closed Time**: June 13 at 10 a.m. PST  
**End Time**: June 13 at 2 p.m. PST  
**Entry Options**:


* 10 Event Tickets
* 100 Play Points

**Structure**: Build your deck, on your schedule, then play up to three matches at your convenience.  
**Prizes**:


* Three wins: 150 Play Points
* Two wins: 100 Play Points
* One win: 40 Play Points
* Zero wins: 10 Play Points

Happy 25th, *Magic*! You have many fun planes on which to battle. And you can now rent a car.


In *Magic*, Change Is the Only Constant
=======================================


Speaking of battles on new planes, starting next month, I will be taking on a new challenge as a game designer for the *MTG Arena* team. *Magic Online* veteran Alli Medwin will be moving down from R&D to take my role as product manager, and Chris Kiritz is still around as the senior product manager.


My eleven years working on *Magic Online* in a variety of roles has been a great experience, and I'm proud of the work I've done. *Magic Online* is as successful as it's ever been, and the suite of events and formats available have made *Magic Online* a fantastic place to play.


In my role on *MTG Arena*, I'll be working with the team focusing on the parts of the game outside actual gameplay. What features will exist for players to measure their progress? To challenge themselves against others? To deepen their engagement with and passion for *Magic*? Stay tuned to find out, as I'm excited to work on them! *MTG Arena* is off to a great start, and I'm excited to help create this fun new digital expression of the world's greatest game.


You'll still be able to find me on Twitter [@mtg\_lee](https://twitter.com/mtg_lee), and remember, if you see WotC\_Lee in your Cube pod, stay out of mono-red.
