2020 *Magic Online* Premier Play System Update
----------------------------------------------


With the announcement of the [updated MTGO Premier Play system](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/introducing-new-magic-online-premier-play-program-2019-12-05), we said we would evaluate the changes and make adjustments where necessary. The early feedback was clear that Preliminary Events weren't quite meeting the goals of the players or *Magic Online*, so last Thursday we updated the Preliminary Event prizes to include an additional 20 QPs for four wins and added Treasure Chests to the Constructed Preliminaries.


Whereas Leagues let players play on their schedule and gradually earn QPs over time, the goal for Preliminary Events is to provide tournament experience for players to get large batches of QPs at once. To put it another way, Prelims allow players to trade the convenience of Leagues for the opportunity to reduce the overall time needed to earn QPs.


With the launch of a new system, however, we wanted to be cautious with QP rewards if Preliminaries were more popular than we expected. After the first few days of data, and coupled with player feedback, we found that we were a bit too cautious and didn't want to wait until the end of the first season to make a change.


Here is the new prize structure for Constructed Preliminaries.


**Constructed Preliminary Events**





| Finish | Prizes |
| --- | --- |
| 5 wins | 600 Play Points, 12 Treasure Chests, and 40 Qualifier Points |
| 4 wins | 450 Play Points, 6 Treasure Chests, and 40 Qualifier Points |
| 3 wins | 300 Play Points and 3 Treasure Chests |

*Vintage Cube* until January 16
-------------------------------


The *Vintage Cube* is back and will run until January 16! Tabletop Studio's (R&D)Â Reggie Valk has this to say about the latest update:


*"As December rolls on,* Magic Online *players know what's coming:* Vintage Cube*. If you're unfamiliar,* Vintage Cube *is one of the most powerful cubes you can play, headlined by the Power Nine and other members of the Vintage reserved list. While considering how to update the Cube for this year's December iteration, I decided that this update wasn't going to attempt any major overhauls, just include some of the most powerful cards to be printed this year. Fortunately, there were quite a few!* War of the Spark *brought powerful new planeswalkers that have made a splash even in Vintage, and* Modern Horizons *and* Throne of Eldraine *were no slouches either. Still, the core of the Cube experience remains the same: there's Tinker-fueled artifact decks, Storm combo, and blistering fast mono-red aggro to name a few. Happy cubing! Here's hoping you all get to open a [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)!"*

Pioneering a New Ban Cadence
----------------------------


For the new Pioneer format, R&D has announced that all changes to the banned list will happen on Mondays. Since we know that many Pioneer fans play on *Magic Online*, we wanted to make it clear how this will work with *Magic Online* league play.


Until the Pioneer format is placed on the normal ban cadence, Pioneer bans will take effect the day after the announcement, at noon Pacific time on Tuesdays.


If a card is banned, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses up until the ban takes effect. At noon PT on Tuesday, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned, players will be able to join the Pioneer league with decks containing those cards after the changes are made effective at noon PT on Tuesday.


For more information about Pioneer, check out [Blake's announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-pioneer-format-2019-10-21).
