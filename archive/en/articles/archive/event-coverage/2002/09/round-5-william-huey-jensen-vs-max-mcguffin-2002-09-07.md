![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcle02/a970.jpg)Round Five paired William "Huey" Jensen, one of the Pro Tour's most entertaining regulars against Max McGuffin, a local player and Junior Super Series Champion. Huey immediately announced his distaste for the format to me.

"This is the worst format ever, right?"

I mentioned Masques Block Constructed, Academy type 2, and Urza Block Constructed. There was no swaying him though. He told me there was at least more of a deck choice in those formats. It surprised me because I knew that he was bringing a very rogue deck to the table. Huey was playing a red/black sorcery deck with [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor)s, and [Magnivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnivore).

Max chose to play a version of Green/Blue Madness. His deck looked fairly standard except that it played both [Elephant Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide)s and [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation)s.

Max won the die roll and started things up with the popular turn one [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study). The Study got him a Rootwalla in play and a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) in his graveyard. He followed it up with a turn two [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) for 3 [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm)s. Huey wasn't bothered by any of this. He played [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact), found a [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) and Wished for [Tombfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombfire) to clean out Max's graveyard. Max didn't let this stop the beats. He played an [Elephant Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Guide) on the Rootwalla and started beating him down with the Rootwalla and a Mongrel.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcle02/a966.jpg)Huey was in trouble. He was down to 12 and could only answer with a [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor). Max attacked and pumped putting Huey on 4 life. Huey brought the [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) he tutored for down on Max's team. Max still had an Elephant and knocked Huey down to one life. Huey had a long way to go to turn the game around. He played Edict on Max's next creature and Tutored again. He tried ending the game early with a huge [Magnivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnivore), but Max had the [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) to end that plan. Neither of them did much for the next three turns. Huey played and then flashed an [Earth Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Rift) trying to knock out Max's green mana. Max had a nearly endless supply of forests from his hand though. Max made an [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), then a Rootwalla, then a Mongrel, but Huey made him sack each of them one at a time. Finally Huey found a [Recoup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoup) and began to go to work on Max. He [Recoup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoup)ed a Tutor, Tutored for [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), drew into a [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact). Copied the [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact). Then copied a [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) and [Morbid Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger)ed his life back up to 7. Max gave up after this and conceded.

Huey 1, McGuffin 0

Game 2 was another close one. Max started off with a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) that didn't trigger a madness card or put a flashback card in the graveyard. He sacked his turn two [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), then countered an [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) to keep his turn 3 Mongrel alive. He brought out another Mongrel the next turn to join the team. Huey tried to [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) them, but Max had another Logic. It looked bad the next turn when Huey tapped out for [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), and Max added an [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) to the team. Max knocked Huey down to only six life, but Huey was not phased. He untapped and [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish)ed for [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate). 

Max played a Squirret Nest to get back into the game and Huey just laughed at him. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpcle02/a965.jpg)"That's pretty good against the land destruction deck!"

Huey took his turn and [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor)edX2 thanks to [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). The next turn he [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish)edX2 for a [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) and a [Morbid Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger). He tried to remove the Nested land the next turn with the [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth), but Max had [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop). Max proceeded to [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) out two Rootwallas the next turn. Huey just [Morbid Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger)edX2 and they were gone. From here it got more disgusting. He WishedX2 then killed off the Squirrel's Nest. Next He [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge)d and WishedX2 again for two [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish). His next turn he WishedX2 and WishedX2 again. Then he began to [Earth Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earth+Rift)X2 Max's lands. Max conceded.

**Final Result:** Huey 2, Max 0
