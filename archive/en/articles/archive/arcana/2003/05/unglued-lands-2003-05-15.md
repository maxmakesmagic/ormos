The *Unglued* set was a special silver-bordered set full of weird and wacky cards that were not tournament legal. But included in the set were five basic lands with black borders.


The black borders meant that the cards would be legal in tournaments, and their unique layout and elongated art boxes made them a hit with players, casual and hardcore alike. To this day, the lands are some of the most highly valued *Unglued* cards on the secondary market.
