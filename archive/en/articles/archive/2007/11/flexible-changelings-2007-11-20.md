Changelings' translucent, blue-green "skin" can stretch and contract to mimic just about any other form. As you can see in the art of some changeling cards, some of the more challenging creature-shapes put that magical skin to the test.

Taking the form of a turtle is like Changeling 101. No problem.


[![Skeletal_Changeling](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/LRW/Skeletal_Changeling.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Skeletal%2BChangeling)

The tiny shapes of a cat skeleton are more of a challenge, but this bemused fellow doesn't seem to notice. (Note that [Skeletal Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Changeling) is both a Cat and a Skeleton, of course.)


[![Changeling_Berserker](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/LRW/Changeling_Berserker.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Changeling%2BBerserker)

Here's a true test of a changeling's flexibility: imitating the flames of a flamekin, as seen on [Changeling Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Berserker)!

[Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer) might show the most impressive feat of changeling mimicry. This changeling is shown not only mimicking the stance and size of a giant, but also his fishing net. [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer) isn't holding a net of its own—note the bluish tint of the structure holding its river fish. It's growing out of the changeling's thumb—it's actually part of his shapechanging body.
