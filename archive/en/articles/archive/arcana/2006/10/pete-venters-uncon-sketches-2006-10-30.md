[UnCon](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=uncon) is the online convention run by and for Wizards community. Every year it cranks out virtual tonnage of games, contests, tournaments, roleplaying, and up-close-and-personal interaction with your favorite gaming deities. 

This year’s UnCon was no different. In one Wizards message boards thread, [Pete Venters took requests](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=723365) for quick **Magic**-themed sketches, and then took it upon his mighty Sharpie to blast out an even [ten of them](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=727066) for UnCon participants to enjoy.

Missed UnCon? Missed your chance for Pete Venters to draw your favorite **Magic** beastie? We recommend you tune in to next year’s UnCon. In the meantime, check out the sketches [from this thread](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=727066)! (Click the “Show” button in the thread to see each sketch!)
