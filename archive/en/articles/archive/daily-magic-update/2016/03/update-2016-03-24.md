The March 24, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 24, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [three-rare packs](#rare).


Today's Previews
================


Every day during preview season, you can look to this section for any previews you might have missed, as we'll keep it updated with anything previewed somewhere other than DailyMTG. Today is the *last* day of previews, so tomorrow make sure to check out the full [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/shadowsoverinnistrad) with everything from *Shadows over Innistrad*.


1. [Seasons Past](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics/v/56271182)

Magic Mics unveiled a green mythic rare last night, ending a lot of speculation that we were screwing with people on the green mythic rare front. [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). That was a funny one. Anyway, if you missed it live, you can check out the preview stream replay below.

1. Twitter previews from...

We've got two more previews coming today that you haven't yet seen, and both will be coming on Twitter. [Aaron Forsythe](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron) and [Dave Humpherys](https://twitter.com/Grumpherys) will both be showing off the final preview cards before tomorrow's full [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/shadowsoverinnistrad). And, who knows, with that coming, maybe I'll feel generous and let a few others loose in the wild before tomorrow.


A Note About Double-Faced Cards in SOI
======================================



1. Triple Up

Back when *Dark Ascension* (the second set in the original *Innistrad* block) was released, I was a player, like you, playing Prereleases and eagerly cracking packs. As was my tradition, I attended a midnight Prerelease and won some packs. And since I love cracking new sets, I set to work opening my prize packs. My very first pack, and the pack that would spoil me for all other packs, contained something I hadn't even contemplated. At the back of the pack I found [Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad). Tucked behind that? My double-faced card, [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells). And behind that?! A foil [Zombie Apocalypse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Apocalypse).


A pack with two mythic rares and a rare. I was hooked.


With the return of double-faced cards in *Shadows over Innistrad*, it is absolutely possible to replicate that thrill again. A normal pack will contain a common or uncommon double-faced card, which is already pretty cool. Approximately one in every eight packs will *also* contain a rare or mythic double-faced card *in addition to a normal rare or mythic rare* (the rare or mythic rare double-faced card will replace a common). These packs will have two double-faced cards, the common/uncommon and the rare/mythic rare.


And that's before we even start considering foils.


So, to recap: one out of every eight packs might contain two rares and/or mythic rares, one of which will be double-faced. And, if you're super-duper fortunate, it might even contain a foil. That's a thing that is possible. In the real world.


Get cracking when Prereleases start next week on April 2, and the full set releases on April 8.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* First Look: Black and Red](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/shadows-over-innistrad-first-look-black-and-red/) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

One of the best players in the history of the game breaks down some of the new cards from the latest set. You should probably pay attention. This is the second article in the series (the first is on [blue and white](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/shadows-over-innistrad-first-look-white-and-blue/)), and since we're pretty close to the end of this whole preview shtick, these types of articles are only going to get more and more frequent. Read it while the reading's good.


1. [Breaking Down Sorin vs. Nahiri](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/carythomasbarkett-032416-breaking-down-sorin-vs-nahiri/) | Gathering Magic | Cary Thomas Barkett

We don't yet know the full story of what went down with Sorin and Nahiri—just that the result is proving to be potentially catastrophic for Innistrad, certainly for Avacyn. But what do we know? What guesses can we make? Cary Thomas Barkett has the low-down on the showdown.


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* Spoilers: Limited Review for March 23](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/shadows-over-innistrad-spoilers-limited-review-for-march-23) | MTGGoldfish | Jake Stiles

So, every day during preview season, Jake Stiles has been handing out grades to newly previewed cards with Limited play in mind. The link above goes to today's article, but you can check out the whole crop of them (A crop of articles? Sure.) on [his author page, here](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/search?author=50). Stiles doesn't have the cache of a Luis Scott-Vargas, but he was definitely first and most complete at this stage of the game.


1. [E039—Bruce Richard—Commanderin' MTG Podcast](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2016/03/24/e039-bruce-richard-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

Bruce Richard joins Phil DeLuca and Nate Burgess on the Commanderin' Podcast to talk about—baking pies maybe? Probably the weather too. Maybe politics?


Commander you say? They're talking about Commander? Well that makes more sense.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [A Draw Should Be Worth 0 Points](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/a-draw-should-be-worth-0-points/) | ChannelFireball | Brian Braun-Duin

With all of the talk lately about concessions and intentional draws, Brian Braun-Duin came up with what he thinks is a solution to the issues that have been bubbling up in the community lately—namely Eric Froehlich's [Grand Prix Houston report](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/11th-in-houston-with-jeskai-black/) and the subsequent article from [Ross Merriam on collusion](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32592_You-Play-To-Win-The-Game.html). BBD's article re-kicked up the controversy and earned a slew of commentary on both the article page itself and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/armlx/status/712854661959708672). There's no hashtag for this one, but you can partake in the discussion further in [the article's](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/a-draw-should-be-worth-0-points/) comment section.


1. > 
> More exciting announcements: Team Channelfireball has joined Team UltraPro! Looking forward to an awesome Pro Tour. <https://t.co/qi1elCJF7G>
> 
> 
>  — Luis Scott-Vargas (@lsv) [March 23, 2016](https://twitter.com/lsv/status/712746084427169792)

Okay, so if you're not familiar with these teams or what this means for the Pro Tour, well, let me tell you.


Prior to this announcement, Team ChannelFireball—formerly one of the largest, most accomplished teams ever—was paired up with Team Face to Face Games. ChannelFireball was still an accomplished team, though their numbers had slowly dwindled until they joined up with Face to Face. Team Ultra Pro is made up of a number of pros who test a bit differently than most pro teams, usually because they all have jobs and wives and kids that they can't simply stay away from for weeks at a time to test. A number of the players were or have even been on ChannelFireball at some point in their careers.


So what does this mean for you, a viewer at home who's merely watching the Pro Tour? It means Sam Black teaming up with Luis Scott-Vargas. It means Team Ultra Pro adds another Hall of Fame pro to its roster. It means Paul Cheon testing with The Innovator, Patrick Chapin.


It means a lot of those story lines are live, but, for the average viewer, not much will change. Your favorite pros will still be at the Pro Tour, they'll still play one-on-one, and you'll still see just as many cool new strategies at [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi). The more things change, and all that.


If you want to see the [full Team Ultra Pro roster](http://www.teamultrapro.com/), well, that's what that link is for.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Isharton—a comic per day](http://isharton.tumblr.com/)

One of our fans has started trying to create one *Magic* comic per day on their Tumblr. Now, you might be asking yourself, what makes this one different than the dozens of others I come across every day as part of the Daily *Magic* Update?


This one made me laugh. It made me smile. It was just fun, enjoyable, and well done. My favorite was the [Hedron Crawler comic](http://isharton.tumblr.com/post/136779386928/sarpadianempiresvol-viii-adorbs-source). Worth a look.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Condemning the Eldrazi](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-cheon-modern-bluewhite-jace-control/)

Even with the Eldrazi still running amok in Modern, some have found success with straight White-Blue Control. Here, Paul Cheon adapts Matt Sperling's list to battle through some *Magic Online* queues. He was [pretty happy about his results with the deck](https://twitter.com/HAUMPH/status/712716524977397765), and was basically crushing everything people could throw at him.


The deck is very much a classic white-blue control deck, with cheap removal, a few counterspells, and some powerful planeswalkers. Plus, of course, [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). It's actually quite remarkable how one of the game's oldest archetypes is able to step up and battle one of Modern's most broken decks simply on the strength of being exactly what it's always been. It just happens to match up well.


And if there are changes to the banned and restricted list come April 4, that doesn't mean White-Blue Control necessarily goes away. It has a lot of flexibility and can be strong in the right metagame.
