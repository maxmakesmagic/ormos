This Weekend: October Qualifier Weekend
=======================================


This weekend, October 9–10, features the first of two [Qualifier Weekends](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend) coming up in October. The entry window for Day 1 and Day 2 of events is from 6–8 a.m. PT.


September Ranked Season badges update after the October 9–10 Qualifier Weekend—if you qualified for the October 30-31 Qualifier Weekends, you won't see your badge for this event until after the October 9-10 Qualifier Weekend.


The second Qualifier Weekend falls at the end of the month, October 30–31. The entry window for Day 1 and Day 2 of this event is also 6–8 a.m. PT, with one note: for those in Europe, the October 31 Day 2 event will start one hour earlier, 14:00–16:00 CEST, because of the end of Daylight Savings (this only applies to Europe).


Play *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Quick Draft
===========================================


Quick Drafts let you draft at your own pace, fast or slow. Like to draft without the pressure of timers—particularly with a new set that you may not be completely familiar with yet? Or maybe you know the set backwards and forwards and want to blast through drafting without waiting for others?


Whichever is your preference, you can play *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Quick Draft games right now and draft against *MTG Arena* bots who don't mind how fast or slow you like draft!


When you're done, craft your 40-card deck and play games against real-life Quick Draft players!

Sunsetting MTG Arena Forums
===========================


Next week, the sun will be setting on the *MTG Arena* forums. They were invaluable during our beta periods when they allowed our development team to communicate directly with the small group of our initial players. When *MTG Arena* launched, most of the conversation moved elsewhere, and it's time we better supported those platforms.


We know having an official place to engage with our development team and to interact with other players is important, which is why we're continuing to work towards launching our [*Magic* Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wZEDMaJwMY). In the meantime, you can still expect the latest news and updates from our weekly announcement article and by following us [@MTG\_Arena](https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena). The latest patch notes are always available in [our *MTG Arena* help center](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/sections/4402585813268-Patch-Notes).
