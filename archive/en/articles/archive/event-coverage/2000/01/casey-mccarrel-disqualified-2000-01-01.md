Casey McCarrel has been disqualified from US Nationals without prize for cheating. For McCarrel, this marks his second disqualification at a Premiere Event, the first coming at Pro Tour-London, where he misrepresented critical information to a judge. That infraction earned him a sixth month suspension.


At the beginning of Game 4, Brian Hegstad called a judge because he was worried about McCarrel's shuffle. When McCarrel shuffled Hegstad's deck, he manipulated the order of the cards. Upon closer inspection, the judges noted that the first eleven cards in Hegstad's deck were spells, which would have forced him into a poor situation, either drawing all spells and no lands, or running into large stretch of land. Head Judge Collin Jackson reviewed all the facts and, after a judges' conference, ejected McCarrel. "I feel confident in my decision," said Jackson, "I think the evidence is pretty clear." Jackson also noted that there would be a DCI investigation. McCarrel was obviously upset by the decision, leaving the tournament area shortly after the decision was issued. "It was unfortunate but necessary," echoed Tournament Manager Jeff Donais, who probably summed it up best.


McCarrel's ejection had positive effects for several other competitors, bumping everyone up in the standings. Dave Price, who finished ninth, woke up to news that he made the Top 8. He smiled, "easiest Top 8 I ever made."
