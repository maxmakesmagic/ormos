**Team:** Courson/Perez/Lopez ("Team Ratchet Bomb")


**Name:** William Courson


**Hometown:** West Green, Georgia


**Occupation:** User Car Salesman


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


2nd place in 13 PPTQs within 4 months


**What did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern format matter?** 


Humans. Linear and disruptive. Yes, so I know who has Bolts.


**How did your team form?**


Perez came to Lopez and I and said we're the best players from Jacksonville, so he would pay our way if we carry him.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Realization of my goals.

**Team:** Courson/Perez/Lopez ("Team Ratchet Bomb")


**Name:** Antonio Perez


**Hometown:** Jacksonville, Florida


**Occupation:** System Engineer


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Top 64 @ SCG Atlanta 2018


Game Day Champion, sadly once. But a lot of second places.


**What did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern format matter?** 


Mono-Green Tron. My teammates were close to making Bronze level and wouldn't be able to play in anymore Grand Prix this year. I said I will help pay if they play.


**How did your team form?**


10-2-1. After Round 5, our second loss, I told them, just like in *Rocky*, "We ain't goin' down no more."


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


It is the highest accomplishment I have had in *Magic* and at 38 years old, the window is closing.

**Team:** Courson/Perez/Lopez ("Team Ratchet Bomb")


**Name:** Andrew Koko Lopez


**Hometown:** Cotton City


**Occupation:** Metro PCS manager


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Top 32 GP


Top 16 Open


**What did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern format matter?** 


Jeskai Control. I played it because I've been playing it for 1 year and in Modern I'm a fan of "play-what-you-know". And no, it didn't matter.


**How did your team form?**


We're glad with the decks we picked and how we picked seatings.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Hard work paid off J

**Team:** Rowe/Tse/Lanthier


**Name:** Jon Rowe


**Hometown:** Ottawa, Ontario Canada


**Occupation:** Real Estate


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


GP Toronto 2010 win


**What did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern format matter?** 


Humans. Hadn't decided on a deck by Wednesday and was feeling pretty anxious — so I defaulted to the "best" deck that didn't overlap. Felix and Dan are the best players of their respective decks in the world.


**How did your team form?**


We're all old. Also old friends.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Bucked list item to go to a Pro Tour with my good friends.

Retired casual player


**What did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern format matter?** 


Red-Green [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). I am like the best Valakut player in the world? (just joking).


We got the best White-Blue player, and a great Human player — I get the rest of the card pool. J


**How did your team form?**


Old friends.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Cross off my last bucket list of going to the Pro Tour with my friends (we always qualified separately).

**What did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern format matter?** 


White-Blue Control, had to teach folks the good ol' gospel of [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel).


Nope, Unified format didn't change a thing.


**How did your team form?**


Friends for well over a decade. Was probably time for us to team up.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


Guess it means I'm back on the Pro Tour?

Last minute [hence the name]. Friday at 6:00 while I was at a wedding.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


First is the best.

Last minute when a friend dropped.

It means everything to me. I was not able to make the Pro Tour by myself but I was with my friends.

We are friends.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


It means I don't regret skipping Brazilian Nationals that's going on right now.

**How did your team form?**


Sam and I team for everything and we decided to add PV for this.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


A chance to tie the Team GP win record (I think)

Some Grand Prix and Pro Tour Top 8s.


**What did you play and why? Did the Team Unified Modern format matter?** 


[Hollow One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollow+One). We knew we wanted a [Blackcleave Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackcleave+Cliffs) deck and thought it was probably the best. We couldn't play Bridgevine because Matt needed Ballista and Matt also hogged the [Damping Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Sphere)s from PV. [Eds. - And Paulo said the format didn't matter...]


**How did your team form?**


Matt and I always team together at Team GPs and Jacob wasn't planning on coming, so we enlisted Paulo.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


A chance to win a second Team GP in Detroit!
