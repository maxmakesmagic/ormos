Doug Beyer previewed Ethersworn Canonist in his [column this week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/4), but we think the art deserves a closer look. Starting with the art description!


**Art Description**



> Location: Esper  
>  Action: Show a lightly armored human acolyte of the Ethersworn (male or female), an order devoted to making sure that all life is infused with the metal called etherium, which they believe will bring about the transcendence of the entire plane of Esper to a higher level of consciousness.   
>  Focus: the militant cleric  
>  Mood: I will uphold the order's principles whether you like it or not.  
>  Notes: All creatures in Esper have at least a little filigree "enhancement." See styleguide.


This went out to Izzy, who turned this in:

The creative team loved it. But there were a few small changes to bring the Canonist in line. A background would obviously have to be added, and for composition reasons, they asked Izzy to flip the card.


There was some discussion about whether her brain was missing, so a bit of the ominous cranial chasm was covered up. And the etherium was scaled back a tiny bit. This collection of small changes did not keep the final art from being awesome:

Here's what the Ethersworn Canonist looks like in card form, in case you missed Doug's article:
