Tom Martell battled back to earn his spot in the semifinals, winning his last four matches after hitting his second loss (with a tie) early on day two. His four-color [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) list had endured Goblins, Burn, and two feature matches to get where he was sitting now.


That loss? The man standing between him and a berth in the finals, Jason Ford, running [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill).


With both decks relying on [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and two-mana blue enchantments, the match threatened to last long into the night if neither player seized any initial advantage. And it didn't disappoint. Or it did, depending on how long you like your untimed semifinal matches.


**Game 1**


Martell kicked off the action with a first turn [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), which he activated in his following upkeep, while Ford has his deck's namesake enchantment, [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), threatening to slow down what already was a pretty slow matchup. He even had the [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) to make it threatening to let sit.


Martel wasted little time breaking the enchantment with an end of turn [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), and Ford discarded an [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and a [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) after drawing his cards.

*Jason Ford works to stay awake during an epic first game* |



A few turns of "draw go" and "draw, Top, go" kept things moving along. Ford [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)ed a [Tundra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tundra) and played a [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). Martell had multiple Tops on the table, but nothing else to worry about with Deed. He continued to activate Top to find an edge.


"Which one?" Ford asked. Martell simply pointed at one. Next time Martell Topped Ford simply asked "Same one?"


Ford then attempted to resolve [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), tapping out to do so and kicking off a flurry of spells. Martell responded with a [Vendillion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendillion+Clique), which met a [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) pitching [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). That, in turn, was met with [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)/shuffle and Top draw and activate. Martell played [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), targeting the original Force, which Ford let resolve, only to again attempt to counter the Clique with another [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). Another [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) from Martell countered the Jace.


Follow all that?


When the dust settled, neither Jace nor the Clique entered the battlefield, and both of Martell's Tops were in his library.


After the carnage of the previous turn, Martell played a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), possibly to bait the [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). Only Ford instead played [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), then attempted to [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) Martell's black-bordered [Tropical Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tropical+Island).


"Can you please target the white-bordered one? For the coverage?" Martell asked. Ford relented.


Martell once again spun the Top and resolved a [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance), but Ford still had his active Deed and an attacking [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory). Martell was down to 12.


Still, the [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)/Top was enough to convince Ford to activate the Deed for two, enabling him to resolve a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) Martell would have to break since he had no way to deal with the Factory otherwise. And he did with a [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) followed by a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).


The Standsill let Ford find yet another [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), which he activated for two. Martell flipped his Top to his library, then binned the [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Ford then used his [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) to target Martell's [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand), which kept him from activating it for fear of losing the Top.


Martell played the Top then dropped another [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), which was met by a fourth [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), though Ford held off on activating it as the [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) took him to 11.


The reason was soon clear, as [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) killed the offending 5/6.

*Now you know everything you need to know about game one* |



Martell continued to play threats, as a Jace began to use its plus-two ability to Fateseal Ford. Factory continued attacking, but now aimed at the Planeswalker. The pattern repeated itself for several turns as Martell used the time Jace bought to work his Tops.


Over, and over, and over againâ€¦


Meanwhile, Saito and Durward were in game three. It was that kind of match.


Eventually, approximately 87 turns later, Martell broke the virtual standstill (not to be confused with the actual card) with a [Vendillion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendillion+Clique), which revealed [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), two [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise), and an [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood). Ford hard cast [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), and Martell countered with, well, [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). The Clique took [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), and then died to [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood).


And Jace and [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) began their little dance again. However, this time Martell attempted to [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) the Factory. Ford chose to preserve it in his graveyard for a future [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) by Ghastly Demising his own land.


And then the players went back to doing a whole lot of nothing, Jacing, and Topping, not necessarily in that order.


After all the nothing, Martell finally found a [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) which also finally prompted Ford to activate his final [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). Martell flipped both of his Tops to his library, but the [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) fell.


Following the pattern of brief periods of action between the spaces of not much happening, Ford [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed, followed by a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) and a [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory). Meanwhile, Jace sat just short of ultimate at 11 counters. Factory was going to be in survival mode, keeping Jace from winning the game outright.


"One short," said Martell.


He chose to break the [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) with a [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance), which he resolved alongside a Top through several counter spells from Ford.


A second [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) allowed Ford to pump for three damage to Jace, and he even had the [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) to stop [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares). However, a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and the Top/[Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) lock was enough to finally convince Ford to move on to Game 2.

Game 2


"I'm borderline going to fall asleep. I haven't eaten anything today, I'm tired of playing, and I'm still not convinced this deck is good," said Ford as he shuffled up after game one lasted over an hour.


The first action of the game was Martell's turn three [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) after both players hit their first land drops. A [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) met [Red Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast), allowing Martell the luxury of an early [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). Though any flips would have to be blind for the time being.

*After an epic game one, Martell made short work of Ford in game two* |



Ford attempted [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) on his turn, but lost it to a [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) that pitched [Vendillion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendillion+Clique). Martell then had his own Jace.


"Hold on, I'm going to think about what I'm going to do with him," said Martell.


"Win?" quipped Ford who was quickly falling behind. Well, relatively quickly. His only action was a [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) on Martell's only red source, followed by [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) on Martell's only green source.


Soon, Martell also had a Top active. With Jace, Top and [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) all working, Ford was going to have to find some serious *Magic* to force game three.


Martell tried to find a clock with [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), but Ford had a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), one of the few spells he would resolve the rest of the game, as Jace began sealing Ford's fate. [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) was countered by [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) ([Krosan Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) , but Ford did manage to find a [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory), but the previously revealed [Krosan Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) kept it from ever touching Jace. And a few turns later, Ford extended his hand.
