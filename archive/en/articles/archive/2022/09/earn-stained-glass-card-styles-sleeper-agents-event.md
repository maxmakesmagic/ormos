*This pitiful world. So flawed, so painfully imperfect, but at least it is malleable. Easy to construct a shell. The shell is gruesome and inelegant, but no more so than those already here. They will not notice. Too concerned with individual things. They claim to be united, but they do not yet know of true unity. They do not yet know the Machine Orthodoxy. But they will.*
