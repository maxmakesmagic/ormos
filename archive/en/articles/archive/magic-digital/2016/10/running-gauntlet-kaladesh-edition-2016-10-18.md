 Better known as NumotTheNummy, Kenji is a lover of all things Magic. A "legendary streamer," you can almost always find him playing Magic Online over at his Twitch channel. When he's not playing Magic, Kenji enjoys long walks on the beach, romantic comedies, and devouring the hopes and dreams of the innocent. 






Another Pro Tour, another spectacular weekend of drafting and Constructed hype. For this edition of Running the Gauntlet, I've picked out a few decks you might find yourself piloting during this Pro Tour's *Magic Online* Gauntlet. Remember, the Pro Tour Gauntlet is not just the selection of decks that made the Top 8, it is a selection of decks that did very well at the Pro Tour. While you might certainly get a deck that was piloted by Shota Yasooka or Carlos Romão, you could also get a deck piloted by anyone else who had a strong showing in the Constructed portion of [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptkld/).


Speaking of Shota Yasooka, let's start things off by taking his Grixis Control list for a spin. An insane removal package backed up by powerful creatures such as [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) and [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) left Yasooka with a ridiculous 8-1-1 record in the Constructed portion of the Swiss rounds.

Next up is Matt Nass's Termur Aetherworks deck. This deck looks to cast what can be a turn-four Eldrazi off the back of [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel). Four copies of both [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) and [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) can end the game in spectacular fashion. Let's take a look.

A bit on the opposite side of things from Shota's Grixis Control and Nass's Aetherworks combo was Makis Matsoukas's Red-White Tokens deck. Going 8-0-2, Makis's deck looked to put the pressure on early and, dare I say, not step off the gas.

Our last deck for this look into the Pro Tour Gauntlet is Pierre Dagen's Blue-Red Spells. As you'll see—and similar to Shota Yasooka's deck—this does not run many win conditions. Four copies of [Dynavolt Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower) headline this list, but even Pierre stated it was the four [Niblis of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niblis+of+Frost)s from his sideboard that generally did the most work. Let's take a look.

This was supposed to be the Pro Tour of [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter), and while that card made a definitive mark in many of the Constructed (and Limited) decks, the format was much more diverse than people were giving it credit for. Remember, this was simply a look at some of the awesome decks you might find yourself randomly getting while playing in the *Magic Online* Pro Tour Gauntlet, but there are many more you might find yourself piloting.


For more information about the Pro Tour *Kaladesh* Gauntlet, including entry options, decklists, and more, be sure to read the [accompanying article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-gauntlet-kaladesh-2016-10-18).


Until next time, may all your draws be gas and all your Vehicles crewed.
