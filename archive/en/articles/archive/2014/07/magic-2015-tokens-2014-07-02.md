[*Magic 2015*](/content/magic-2015-core-set-card-set-archive-products-game-info) has a whopping twelve tokens and two emblems, some old, many new, and all headed your way when Prereleases kick off July 12.



Let's start by taking a look at the old:

The Insect token was first seen in Commander alongside [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). With the return of the Queen in M15, she brings her minions with her. Soldiers, and specifically this art, have been seen in the core set before. Zombies, Goblins, and Beasts are creature types we revisit all the time, so it's no surprise to see them here.



Additionally, we've seen Spirit tokens before, but Mike Sass updated the art for *Magic 2015*. It pairs nicely with Spirit Bonds from the [*Magic 2015*Card Image Gallery](/content/magic-2015-core-set-card-set-archive-products-game-info).

And now for the completely new (and definitely blue), Squid! Chasm Skulker will certainly be spitting out plenty of these horrors.

*Magic 2015*also contains not one, but *two*Beast tokens. Garruk definitely is making his presence felt in this set, including in the look, feel, and abilities of this other, darker Beast token.

Wait, there's a card that makes *Dragon tokens*?! It hasn't been revealed yet, but sign me up anyway.

Adam Styborski previews the card that makes this particular token tomorrow. You'll clearly want to check out his article to see where this Treefolk Warrior comes from!

The last token, but certainly not least, is easily my favorite in the set. Goblin Kaboomist was previewed long ago with a really funky mechanic that created *Magic's* first Land Mine token. Now you can see it in all of its, um, glory.

And, of course, no token preview Arcana is complete without showing off the emblems you can create with the set's new Planeswalkers. Ajani Steadfast and Garruk, Apex Predator will be leaving their marks—literally and figuratively—all over Limited and Standard in upcoming months with these two emblems, including the first one you actually give to your opponent!
