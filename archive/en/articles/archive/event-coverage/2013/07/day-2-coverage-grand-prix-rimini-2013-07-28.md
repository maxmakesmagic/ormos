Day two of Grand Prix Rimini is about to start, with just over 160 players returning to the Palacongressi Rimini for the first serious draft of  ***Magic** 2014*  Limited. Pretty shortly we'll have answers to questions about the viability of Slivers, [Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster)s and [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason)s... or will an entirely unexpected strategy emerge? With players of the calibre of Ben Stark, Frank Karsten, Shuuhei Nakamura, and Olle Rade in the field we have a good chance of finding out, and seeing some fireworks along the way.


Leading the field after the first day of Sealed action are six players with impeccable 9-0 records; Zoltan Szoke and Tamas Glied of Hungary, German Raoul Zimmerman, Swede Rasmus Bjorklund, Spain's Chistian Retuerta, and Lorenzo Barnini flying the flag for the home country, Italy. A single defeat would cast any of those six leaders down into the mix along with some huge players hungry for a Top 8 berth, including Ben Stark, Denniz Rachid and the 2013 Rookie of the Year Felipe Tapia Becerra from Chile.


Who will stay cool in the heat of summer, and whose challenge will wilt away under the scrutiny of drafting a new set for the first time?


Let's find out!

Sunday, 11:05 a.m. – Frank Karsten's Magic List of Cards
--------------------------------------------------------


*by David Sutcliffe*

 

If there's a man you can rely on to have done his homework on a new format it's the number crunching phenomenon from the Netherlands, Frank Karsten – a man who probably even has his breakfast options sorted by pick order. Frank had eased into the second day of Grand Prix Rimini on 7-2 but his exhaustive work on  ***Magic** 2014*  draft placed him in good stead for a run towards the Top-8.


While Frank wanted to keep some secrets to himself, and admitted that he's still working out some of the wrinkles in the rankings with other Pros, he was willing to sit down and share an awful lot of his already vast knowledge of  ***Magic** 2014* . Specifically, we wanted to know how the Commons ranked together.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/Karsten_Picks.jpg)  
*Frank Karsten* 
"What I did was I took screenshots of all of the cards and put them into a few files, then started moving the images around to make a list of the cards in order you would pick them – assuming no card interactions mattered of course. I've put that file onto my iPad and it's been a really useful tool to bring to Rimini because it's helped us talk through our picks. I spent some time going through it with Ben Stark and that has already changed how I am thinking about some of the cards. It's good that we don't all agree on the pick order."



![Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pacifism)

#1 [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism)


#2 [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage)


#3 [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)


#4 [Liturgy of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liturgy+of+Blood)


#5 [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia)


#6 [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness)


"The top picks in the format are all the removal spells, particularly the ones that basically deal with any threat, like [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) or [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia). I think Ben Stark rates [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) below [Liturgy of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liturgy+of+Blood) and [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia) because it only does 2 damage, so doesn't kill big creatures. I like [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) more than he does – I think a lot of 4 drops you want to kill have 2 toughness, like [Charging Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Griffin) or [Deathgaze Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgaze+Cockatrice), and [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) lets you deal with those cards and keep tempo. Killing a 4 drop for 1 mana is really good. The fact that [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) is an Instant is also important because it stops combat tricks, and I won a game yesterday with [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) in response to [Enlarge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlarge)."



![Master of Diversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Master+of+Diversion)

#7 [Trained Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Condor)


#8 [Master of Diversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Diversion)


"These are the best creatures – they're both efficient creatures and good attackers which enable your other creatures. They both make it very hard for your opponent to block your attacks. It's interesting that I don't think people value [Master of Diversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Diversion) highly yet – I just had one table around to me in the first draft, which I didn't expect."


"After the Condor and [Master of Diversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Diversion) I think you get a big group of creatures that are hard to rank against each other – they're basically the best creatures from each color, the creatures that can stand alone and have an impact in the game. I rank creatures particularly highly in  ***Magic** 2014*  because I've found that in this draft format you can end up playing decks with not many creatures, only 12-13 in some drafts. My philosophy for  ***Magic** 2014*  is 'when in doubt take the creature'."


And those best creatures are...



![Nephalia Seakite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nephalia+Seakite)

[Nephalia Seakite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Seakite) and [Messenger Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Messenger+Drake) in Blue


[Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), [Deadly Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse), [Rumbling Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rumbling+Baloth) or [Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rootwalla) in green.


"Green has a lot of really good creatures, and that makes Green a solid color despite not really having any removal"


[Charging Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Griffin) in White


"White seems to be a weak color overall"


[Deathgaze Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgaze+Cockatrice) in Black


"Black has weak creatures, generally. [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) is a low pick in this format because I don't think 2 mana 2/1s are good. There are too many creatures that are 2/3 or 2/4 and your 2/1 gets outclassed very quickly. With [Master of Diversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Diversion) and [Trained Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Condor) they go up in value but otherwise a 2/1 can easily sit around and do nothing".



![Marauding Maulhorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Marauding+Maulhorn)

[Marauding Maulhorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marauding+Maulhorn) in Red.


"[Pitchburn Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchburn+Devils) are ok but I find that the best creatures from the other colors are either bigger or have evasion, and the Devils can't compete in either case. [Pitchburn Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchburn+Devils) moves up a lot in the R/B sacrifice deck with things like [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn) and [Altar's Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Reap), though.


Frank then shared a few general thoughts about the  ***Magic** 2014*  draft format:


"If you look at the 3 drops and 4 drops in  ***Magic** 2014*  there are a lot of 4/4s, 4/3s, or flyers. There's not many 2/2s or 3/2s that would allow a Grizzly Bear to trade up, and that's a big reason why the two drops are less important in this format.


Although I've given you a 'pick order' I think the pick order breaks down a lot, and it's more important to have 1 of each creature than lots of the same one – you'd rather have 1 [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) and 1 [Rumbling Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rumbling+Baloth) than 2 Baloths, for instance. There are also some important deck synergies that the pick order doesn't show. I just drafted B/W and that deck often uses a lot of enchantments, which meant I picked an [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) quite early, hoping to see [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) later. The B/W decks also have a really good synergy between [Master of Diversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Diversion) and [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) – that makes a really powerful attacking creature, and the [Lifelink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink) stops one of the best counters to [Master of Diversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Diversion), which is to race him".


Frank's pick orders have started some interesting discussions already. Where's the love for [Dawnstrike Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnstrike+Paladin), is [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) better than [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia), and is [Trained Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Condor) really the best common Creature?


What do you think?

Round 10 Feature Match – Felipe Tapia Becerra vs. Ben Stark
-----------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobi Henke*

 

"It's amazing, maybe better than mine. It just doesn't line up very well with what I've got," said Ben Stark about Felipe Tapia Becerra's deck after his quick 2-0 win. "I mean, he had to [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) my [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer) which just returned [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination). That can't end well." And indeed the match was decided purely on card advantage, of which there was a lot—on Stark's side.


Rookie of the Year and Chilean national champion Tapia Becerra had drafted an aggressive black-red deck, featuring an impressive array of removal spells. Still it was no match for the blue-red deck piloted by Limited mastermind Stark.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/fm10_tapia_becerra.jpg)  
*Felipe Tapia Becerra* 
Stark's [Messenger Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Messenger+Drake) and [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) met Tapia Becerra's [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) and [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness), to allow [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) to continue its attacking. But while Tapia Becerra was pulling ahead in life, Stark was pulling ahead in cards. [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) was followed by [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer), which drew the aforementioned [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) from Tapia Becerra, and when Stark cast [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) and re-cast the [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), Tapia Becerra's offense was stopped for good.


[Marauding Maulhorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marauding+Maulhorn) provided Stark with a solid clock of his own, and [Time Ebb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Ebb), [Volcanic Geyser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Geyser), and [Disperse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse), all generating further tokens via [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), sealed the deal.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/fm10_stark.jpg)  
*Ben Stark* 
The second game provided more of the same. Once again, Tapia Becerra started fast with [Corpse Hauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Hauler)s and [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn), but Stark, with a little bit of help from [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), found [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), then retrieved it with [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer), and traded away his [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) for two cards (a creature sacrificed to [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn) and [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh)). He finally got rid of [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn) with [Volcanic Geyser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Geyser), then was able to draw several cards off [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), and in the end a couple of fliers, including [Messenger Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Messenger+Drake), took the game.


Throughout the whole match, the black-red deck had to trade one for one again and again, until there was nothing more to trade away. Stark buried Tapia Becerra in cards and scored a decisive victory.

Round 11 Feature Match – Zoltan Szoke vs. Raoul Zimmerman
---------------------------------------------------------


*by David Sutcliffe*

 

Former Hungarian national champion Zoltan Szoke earnt a perfect 11-0 record by defeating Raoul Zimmerman of Germany 2-1 in a swift storm of Sliver synergies.


With both players suffering mana problems to trade losses in the second and third games the decisive win came in the first, with Szoke's lightning Sliver offense simply too quick for Zimmerman's slower U/W deck to contain.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/Round-11-Zimmerman.jpg)  
*Raoul Zimmerman* 
The first game went by in a blurred flurry of Sliver claws. Szoke threw down a pair of [Sentinel Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel+Sliver)s, upped the ante with a [Steelform Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steelform+Sliver) then sealed the deal with a [Bonescythe Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonescythe+Sliver)! Raoul Zimmerman's best defense had been a [Capashen Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Capashen+Knight) with [Divine Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) but the Knight was just one man against a Sliver swarm and the game was done inside four minutes!


"I guess there are worse curves than that" commented Zimmerman, wryly, as he shuffled up for the second game.


The Hare had won the first game but the second game went to the Tortoise. Szoke's mana misfired, leaving the Hungarian with two [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and a hand of white Slivers and expensive green Slivers – none of which he could cast! Zimmerman's U/W deck went onto the offensive but [Windstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windstorm) and [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) destroyed his flyers leaving a lone [Phantom Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Warrior) to do the heavy lifting. Enchanted with [Divine Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) the [Phantom Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Warrior) devoured Szoke's lifetotal over many turns and not even the late arrival of a [Megantic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megantic+Sliver) could save the Hungarian... 14...11...8...5...2... done.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/Round-11-Szoke.jpg)  
*Zoltan Szoke* 
The decisive game was deciding by the opening hands, with Zimmerman mulliganing away his original 7 cards to keep 6 then stalling on two lands. Across the table Zoltan Szoke was only on two lands as well, but those two lands had enabled him to cast a [Sentinel Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel+Sliver) and [Predatory Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predatory+Sliver), with a [Hive Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Stirrings) added as Szoke found a third land. Unable to defend himself Raoul Zimmerman quickly accepted his fate and conceded defeat.


"My opening hand was all my big expensive cards and I knew that would be too slow against you so I had to mulligan", Zimmerman explained after the match. "Then my six cards were basically the same but with a 3-drop and only two lands. I needed my draws to be really good or I couldn't beat you."

Sunday, 12:55 p.m. – Drafting with Felipe Tapia Becerra
-------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobi Henke*

 

The reigning Rookie of the Year Felipe Tapia Becerra came all the way to Europe to lead the Chilean national team at next week's World **Magic** Cup. On his way he made a stop in Rimini for this Grand Prix and so far it looked as if the little detour was going to pay off. Going into the first draft of the day he was 8-1, in 19th place, well in contention for a Top 8 berth later in the day.


He opened a strong first pack including [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), [Water Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant), [Deadly Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse), [Essence Scatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter), [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage), and a little surprise in the form of a second foil copy of [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage). Outrage was arguably the best card here, but should he risk taking it and having his neighbor to the left take the other copy? A difficult decision, to be sure, but in the end he did take the Outrage (as did the player to his left).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/blog_draft1.jpg)  
*Felipe Tapia Becerra* 
For his second pick, Tapia Becerra chose [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur) over [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia) and a host of white cards like [Celestial Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Flare) and [Fiendslayer Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiendslayer+Paladin). [Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear)ly, black-red was a preference of his. Next he took [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh) over [Deadly Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Recluse), [Charging Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Griffin), and [Illusionary Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Armor).


Pick four was [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness), passing yet another [Illusionary Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Armor), followed by [Time Ebb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Ebb) out of an empty pack. It appeared black and red were indeed drying up, as his next pick was [Thunder Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Strike).


His colors made a remarkable recovery, however. For his seventh pick, he was given the choice between [Dragon Hatchling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Hatchling), [Molten Birth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Birth), and [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn), and took the latter. Then came [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur) over [Nightwing Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightwing+Shade) and [Cyclops Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclops+Tyrant). Ninth he took [Essence Scatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter) rather than settle for [Minotaur Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Abomination), so, with now two blue cards and four black, a switch of colors was at least still possible. Then again, the tenth-pick [Accursed Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Spirit) almost put a stop to those considerations. [Wild Guess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Guess), some Staffs, and a [Strionic Resonator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strionic+Resonator) rounded out pack one.


Now, if the [Accursed Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Spirit) hadn't settle Tapia Becerra firmly into black, [Shadowborn Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowborn+Demon), his first pick from the second pack certainly did. Next up was [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) out of an empty booster, followed by [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) out of a booster which still held [Deathgaze Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgaze+Cockatrice) and [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness).



![Liliana's Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Liliana%27s+Reaver)

His fourth pick was [Liliana's Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Reaver) over [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire), his fifth was [Liturgy of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liturgy+of+Blood) over [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night). Another Child and another Liturgy followed. The rest of the pack gave him a [Corpse Hauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Hauler), an [Altar's Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Reap), another [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur), and he even received an unexpected present for his tenth pick, when [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) made it all the way around the table back to Tapia Becerra. Black was definitely the color he was supposed to draft.


Pack three started with a couple of 2/1 two-drops. [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) and [Corpse Hauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Hauler) were a bit of a letdown from the second round of picks, but nothing to worry about. Sure enough the black and red cards started flowing soon enough: Pick three was [Pitchburn Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchburn+Devils) over [Gnawing Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnawing+Zombie), followed by [Dragon Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Egg) over [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh).


Pick five may have been the most interesting choice in the draft. The pack had [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness), [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur), and [Accursed Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Spirit), but instead of taking any of these three black cards, Tapia Becerra chose [Lightning Talons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Talons). Apparently, he was attempting to get one of these black cards back around the table. Gambling on a 13th pick seemed somewhat ambitious, but to be fair, he had been passed a tenth-pick [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) before already.


His sixth pick was [Pitchburn Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchburn+Devils), his seventh was [Deathgaze Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgaze+Cockatrice), and in between a string of off-color cards he simply took for lack of options Tapia Becerra was able to scoop up a [Gnawing Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnawing+Zombie). And finally, his 13th pick was indeed the [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur) he'd seen earlier.


All in all, the draft went extremely well and Tapia Becerra's deck looked amazing. He ended up with quite a number of removal spells; not the most spectacular body of creatures, though, but with a few highlights—[Shadowborn Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowborn+Demon), [Liliana's Reaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Reaver)—nevertheless. A couple of wins should definitely be in the cards here.

Round 13 Feature Match – Tamas Nagy vs. Tamas Glied
---------------------------------------------------


*by David Sutcliffe*

 

Five-time Hungarian national champion Tamas Nagy defeated his compatriot, former World **Magic** Cup teammate and namesake Tamas Glied 2-1 to virtually ensure a berth in the Top 8 of Grand Prix Rimini.


Nagy's powerful mono-black deck simply contained too much control for Glied's U/G deck, with Nagy's suite of [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s making his [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) and triple [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) all the more powerful. While Tamas Nagy channelled [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s Tamas Glied was channeling [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s, unfortunately his [Howl of the Night Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howl+of+the+Night+Pack) came up just one or two Wolves short in the final analysis as it was diluted by a couple of fateful [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/Round-13-Glied.jpg)  
*Tamas Glied* 
"Come on Tamas!" shouted the Hungarian spectators, enjoying the sight of two of their own in the feature match area so late in the Grand Prix, the support applied equally to both men, and the match was underway...


Glied took to the front foot in the first game, his [Seacoast Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seacoast+Drake) being gifted a [Trollhide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trollhide) then joined by a [Woodborn Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodborn+Behemoth), sending Nagy onto the defensive. The Hungarian champion's [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur) did little to stem the tide but a [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) and [Liturgy of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liturgy+of+Blood) followed to finally stabilise the game. Nagy braced himself for a second wave of offense but it never came, with the last two cards in Glied's hand being a [Lay of the Land](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+of+the+Land) and [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot). That gave Nagy the initiative, and with a [Vampire Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Warlord) and [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) hitting play it didn't take long for victory to come.



![Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Child+of+Night)

Nagy began the second game in a much more aggressive fashion with a pair of [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night), and [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur) and a [Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster) putting him onto the offensive while Glied struggling to defend himself with an [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic). The arrival of a [Kalonian Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Tusker) stalled Nagy's attack then on the next turn Glied powered out an impressive [Howl of the Night Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howl+of+the+Night+Pack) to summon six Wolf tokens! The game turned on its head at this point then a [Frost Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) further tied down Nagy's creatures and opened the way for Glied to attack. When Nagy was hit with the [Frost Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) he was 26-14 ahead on life, but by the time his [Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight)caller and [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur) untapped he was 10-14 down. Another turn later and Nagy was 1-14 down and conceding defeat, revealing a hand of [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s to Glied as he did so.


A slow start to the deciding game saw Nagy first out of the blocks with a [Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster) but he was joined immediately by Glied, who used Flash to cast [Briarpack Alpha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarpack+Alpha) and start attacking. The Alpha was too big for [Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster) and Glied followed it with an even-bigger [Woodborn Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodborn+Behemoth). Although it didn't seem it at the time, the Behemoth became the critical play as it had tapped Glied out and left him unable to cast [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). Nagy enchanted his [Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster) with [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire), giving the [Briarpack Alpha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarpack+Alpha) -2/-2 then finishing it off with [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh). The 4/5 [Lifelink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink)[Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster) was now the biggest show in town and Glied's Behemoth was immediately outclassed.


Nagy followed up with a [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare), calling on the power of his [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, and Glied called on his [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s with [Howl of the Night Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howl+of+the+Night+Pack) to create four Wolf tokens! The Wolves finally stopped Nagy's [Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight)caller but the [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) flew overhead and struck Glied down to 5 life. Reeling onto the ropes Tamas Glied pulled a great card for this situation - the [Frost Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath). Glied tapped down both Nagy's [Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight)caller and [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) and went to work with his Wolves and [Woodborn Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodborn+Behemoth). It was a combination that had won the first game, but the difference between six Wolf tokens and only four proved crucial, with Glied unable to win the game before Nagy's [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) untapped and dealt the final blow.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/Round-13-Nagy.jpg)  
*Tamas Nagy* 
"The [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) won it", Glied said, revealing the [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) he was still holding in hand and had been unable to counter the [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) with.


"I made Top 4 at the last Grand Prix I played in," Nagy told me, "but that was about five years ago, in Brussels. I only play Pro Tours and World **Magic** Cup because it's too expensive to travel for Grand Prix"


With Nagy's record it's a shame we don't see more of the Hungarian pro on the Grand Prix circuit because he would sure of success.

Sunday, 3:45 p.m. – Drafting with Tamas Nagy
--------------------------------------------


*by David Sutcliffe*

 

The World **Magic** Cup in 2012 saw a solid Hungarian team get right to the very brink of glory, losing their Semifinal match to the eventual winners Chinese Taipei. With two of last year's team returning for this World **Magic** cup the Hungarians would be looking to improve on that result, and they were honing their skills well here in Rimini. No less than three of the top pod for the second draft were Hungarian, with Tamas Glied, Zoltan Szoke and the reigning national champion Tamas Nagy (who has actually won 5 out of the last 7 Hungarian national championships) all lined up for the final sprint finish to the Top 8.


We followed Nagy in the second draft, and after a rocky start the Hungarian champ ended up with what appears to be a powerful pool. Let's see how that happened.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/Nagy-Draft-Pic.jpg)  
*Tamas Nagy* 
### Pack One



![Kalonian Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kalonian+Tusker)

P1P1: Pausing briefly to read [Path of Bravery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+of+Bravery), Nagy settled quickly on a [Kalonian Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Tusker).


P1P2: The only green pick available was a [Manaweft Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manaweft+Sliver) and Nagy was making the decision between [Marauding Maulhorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marauding+Maulhorn) or [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness), settling for the black enchantment.


With just two picks gone it seemed like Nagy had made a strong color commitment already – the [Kalonian Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Tusker) required GG to cast, while he would also need a lot of [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s to make use of the [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness). He seemed like a man who knew he wanted to play G/B.


P1P3: Nagy spent a while evaluating Into The Wilds before settling for a modest [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh).


P1P4: The flexible [Trading Post](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trading+Post) was chosen over more obvious G/B picks like [Trollhide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trollhide), [Advocate of the Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advocate+of+the+Beast) and [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn)


P1P5: [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) was prioritised over [Windstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windstorm) in a booster that still had A LOT of good blue cards.


P1P6: [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) over [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh)



![Accursed Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Accursed+Spirit)

P1P7: [Accursed Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Spirit)


P1P8: [Vampire Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Warlord)


P1P9: [Shrivel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrivel)


P1P10: [Spell Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Blast)


P1P11: Sanctum Offering


P1P12: [Essence Scatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter)


P1P13: [Demolish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish)


P1P14: [Artificer's Hex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificer%27s+Hex)


The first pick [Kalonian Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalonian+Tusker) seemed a long time ago, with Nagy avoiding several playable green cards along the way ([Advocate of the Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advocate+of+the+Beast), [Windstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windstorm)). What Tamas Nagy had after the first booster was a collection of black spells, but few that really set the world alight. As the Hungarian champ looked at his [Essence Scatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter) and [Spell Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Blast) as a potential blue splash he had to hope that the second booster would bring more reward for putting his faith in the dark side.


### Pack Two



![Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nightmare)

P2P1: [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare)


The dark lords were quick in responding to Nagy's plight, sending him the fearsome [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) in return for his loyalty.


P2P2: [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) and [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) were unattractive Black options and Nagy picked the highly splashable [Illusionary Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Armor) over a [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot).


P2P3: With [Shadowborn Apostle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowborn+Apostle) the only black option Nagy was happy to take [Nephalia Seakite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Seakite) and cement his blue splash option.


P2P4: [Gnawing Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnawing+Zombie) and [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) were the black picks in a booster with some good red cards: [Pitchburn Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pitchburn+Devils) and [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock). The [Gnawing Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnawing+Zombie) was Nagy's pick.


P2P5: [Opportunity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opportunity)


By this stage Nagy seemed settled in his U/B deck, but aside from the [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) his first few picks were low on the sort of staples that you would expect to see. He needed bodies and he needed them badly.


P2P6: [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur)


P2P7: [Deathgaze Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgaze+Cockatrice)



![Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archaeomancer)

P2P8: [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer)


P2P9: [Time Ebb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Ebb)


P2P10: [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot)


P2P11: [Shadowborn Apostle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowborn+Apostle)


P2P12: [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night)


P2P13: [Staff of the Flame Magus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+the+Flame+Magus)


P2P14: [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason)


Tamas Nagy picked up a few solid picks there, with [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur) and [Deathgaze Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgaze+Cockatrice) staple creatures in any Black deck. The last pick [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) was a real eyebrow-raiser, though, and surely indicated that there were no R/B sacrifice decks on the table!


### Pack Three



![Haunted Plate Mail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Haunted+Plate+Mail)

P3P1: [Haunted Plate Mail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Plate+Mail) was preferred over a [Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster). With only one [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) to his name Nagy plumped for the hefty equipment.


P3P2: [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn) preferred over [Accursed Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Spirit)


P3P3: [Liturgy of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liturgy+of+Blood). Aside from his second-pick [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) this was the first time Nagy had seen one of the big black removal spells all draft!


P3P4: [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination)


Four decent picks, but then Nagy hit a real seam of good picks and the quality of the Hungarian's deck was suddenly transformed!


P3P5: [Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster)


P3P6: [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur)


P3P7: [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness)


P3P8: [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness)



![Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blightcaster)

P3P9: [Blightcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightcaster)


Wowzers. How to draft a deck in five cards.


P3P10: [Vial of Poison](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vial+of+Poison)


P3P11: [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night)


P3P12: [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh)


P3P13: [Vile Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Rebirth)


P3P14: [Zephyr Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zephyr+Charge)


With playable black cards coming all the way down to 13th pick the last booster had done Nagy's chances of making Top 8 a world of good. The biggest question the Hungarian would face was whether it was worth going mono-black or if the pull of his blue splash was too strong. Either way, Tamas Nagy was well-placed to lead the Hungarian charge towards winning Grand Prix Rimini!

Sunday, 4:30 p.m. – Meet Miguel Gatica
--------------------------------------


*by David Sutcliffe*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/costa-rica-flag.jpg)Yesterday we met Canadian Jon Stern, who had travelled to Grand Prix Rimini as part of his preparation for next weekend's World **Magic** Cup. The Canadians are not here alone, however, and a strategic alliance has been formed with the Costa Rican team - the two teams have booked the same hotel in Amsterdam and will be working together to prepare for the challenges of the World **Magic** Cup.


This joint effort between Canada and Costa Rica has come about, partly, because the captains of the two nations are friends from the Pro Tour circuit. Having met Canadian champ Jon Stern already I sat down with the Costa Rican national champion Miguel Gatica, currently on 11-3 in the Grand Prix with a round to play, to find out more about this unlikely international alliance and what the World **Magic** Cup means for Latin America.


"I travel a lot for **Magic**, but if it wasn't for the World **Magic** Cup I would be in Calgary not Rimini. I came to Verona and Utrecht last year, though, so it's not my first time in Europe. I started last season really well and that made me go to more events to see how many Pro Points I could get in the year. The season didn't end so well for me but I finished 12th at Pro Tour Return To Ravnica and that means I've been able to make the step up to playing full time and I've been on the Pro Tour train full time since September. It's very hard to get onto the Pro Tour for players from many Latin American countries, for instance in Costa Rica we maybe get one PTQ per year. That's not per PTQ season, that's per year. In Costa Rica if you want to play **Magic** competitively you have to leave Costa Rica – I qualified for Pro Tour Return To Ravnica by winning a PTQ in El Salvador, for instance".


Does the final of last year's World **Magic** Cup, between Chinese Taipei and Puerto Rico, give you hope that you can do the same?


"Definitely. I think Costa Rica have a chance of making the Top 8 at least. I knew that Tzu-Ching was a very good player for Chinese Taipei, but when I saw that Puerto Rico were in the final... if Puerto Rico can do that then Costa Rica can definitely do it too. It wasn't just Puerto Rico, though, I think Uruguay also did well last year? The World **Magic** Cup is actually a really important event for Latin America because it's a chance for us to compete on a level playing field – it's a really good platform for Latin American players to prove they can play **Magic** at the top level."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/Miguel-Gatica.jpg)  
*Miguel Gatica* 
"It's not easy to practice a lot for Pro Tours in Costa Rica, there is really only myself and Carlos Pal who can practice for the Pro Tour, but now we work with Mana[Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive)d to test for Pro Tours, and I've just started writing for MTGMadness as well. I run my own business and that gives me enough time to play **Magic Online** a lot and that is a good way to practice for the Pro Tours. Between my business, playing **Magic Online**, travelling to Grand Prix and Pro Tours and now writing articles I'm very busy, but I see **Magic** as fun not work, so it's not so bad!"


What has Grand Prix Rimini taught you about  ***Magic** 2014*  Limited, ahead of the World **Magic** Cup? Has anything been surprisingly good?


"The format is definitely slower than I thought it would be. I've got a deck that is almost mono-blue in the second draft, with just two black spells. I think U/B is the best color combination – I drafted a really strong U/B deck with three [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer)s in the first draft and went 3-0. I tried to get the same deck this time but the guy to my right cut me out of Black so I'm all blue, it's hopefully still good, though. I think [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer) is one of the best cards in the format, especially combined with black removal like [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade). What has surprised me? Intimidate has. The creatures with Intimidate are really difficult to stop. Flyers are always flyers and you have cards like [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) to kill them, but Intimidate is really powerful in  ***Magic** 2014* ."


Miguel Gatica makes a powerful case for not discounting the players from Latin America at next week's World **Magic** Cup. Under his stewardships, and working with the Canadian contingent, Costa Rica are going to be as well prepared as possible for whatever challenges the **Magic** World Cup will bring. We wish him luck!

Round 14 Feature Match – Emanuele Giusti vs. Alberto Mattioli
-------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobi Henke*

 

With the Top 8 on the line, Emanuele Giusti combined [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn) with [Tenacious Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tenacious+Dead), [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur) with [Shiv's Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shiv%27s+Embrace), and [Volcanic Geyser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Geyser) with, well, with lands for a quick 2-0 victory.


The all-Italian feature match pinned two-time Grand Prix champion Emanuele Giusti, winner of the previous GP in Rimini, against newcomer Alberto Mattioli. Giusti was piloting red-black aggro with a small sacrifice theme, while Mattioli entered the fray with blue-black fliers.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/fm14_mattioli.jpg)  
*Alberto Mattioli* 
In the first game, Giusti's [Tenacious Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tenacious+Dead) teamed up with [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn) for some potentially lethal combination, and the Bairn was indeed chumpblocked a couple of times, but in fact it were Giusti's [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur)s that did most of the work. The board was soon cluttered with various 3-thoughness creatures ([Gnawing Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnawing+Zombie), [Undead Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Minotaur)) but the 3/3s marched on.


When Mattioli tried to put a stop to that, summoning [Water Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant) for help, Giustio was already able to simply turn all of his creatures sideways, then all of his lands, for a game-ending [Volcanic Geyser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Geyser).


In the second game, [Blood Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Bairn) again played a crucial role, when it prevented Mattioli's [Time Ebb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Ebb) from pushing through any damage. (The [Time Ebb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Ebb)ed creature was sacrificed to turn the Bairn a temporary 4/4, enough of a deterrent to prevent any attacks at all.)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gprim13/fm14_giusti.jpg)  
*Emanuele Giusti* 
Still, for a while it looked as if Mattioli was too far ahead. His [Wall of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost) stabilized the ground and his [Messenger Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Messenger+Drake) started to apply some pressure. Even Giusti's [Cyclops Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclops+Tyrant) was safely tucked away under [Sensory Deprivation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensory+Deprivation), and to make matters worse Mattioli had just added [Colossal Whale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossal+Whale) to his side of the battlefield. But with Giusti's [Altar's Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Reap) things started to turn. [Liturgy of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liturgy+of+Blood) got rid off the Whale and [Shiv's Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shiv%27s+Embrace) suddenly provided Giusti with a veritable clock, ticking much faster than his opponent's [Messenger Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Messenger+Drake).


Soon the Drake chumped, was retrieved via [Corpse Hauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Hauler), and chumped again, all the while drawing several extra cards ... but all to no avail. Mattioli couldn't find an answer to the flying, firebreathing 5/5, and soon extended his hand in concession.


So, Mr. Giusti, yet another Grand Prix win? "Well, maybe," said Giusti ... and smiled.
