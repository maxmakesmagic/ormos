The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 19, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [these sweet San Diego Comic-Con *Magic* promos](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/san-diego-comic-con-2016-magic-promos-2016-07-19).


Today's Must
============


1. [There's No Problem with Politics in Commander](http://generaldamagecontrol.com/theres-no-problem-with-politics-in-commander/) | General Damage Control | Chris "EDH Ghost"

Yesterday there was an article on StarCityGames.com by Erik Tiernan titled "[The Problem with Politics in Commander](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33302_The-Problem-With-Politics-In-Commander.html)," in which he covered some discussion points on politics in Commander that he had had with EDH Ghost (aka Chris). Chris, in turn, wrote a rebuttal of sorts. Both are excellent reading on what it means to be political in a game of Commander and how useful, or not, those distinctions are.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Commander Review: *Eldritch Moon* Part 1 (White, Blue, Black](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/commander-review-eldritch-moon-part-1-white-blue-black)) | MTGGoldfish | Tomer Abramovici

Let's stick with Commander for the moment. There are so few Commander set reviews these days, every one is like a precious little gem, at least compared to straight-up set reviews. If you're into Commander, savor this. *I said savor it!*


1. [5 Cards That Get Better with *Eldritch Moon*](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/5-cards-that-get-better-with-eldritch-moon/) | ChannelFireball | Brian Braun-Duin

Minus the cheeky ending (and it is oh-so cheeky), this is a good look at how the format can shift once *Eldritch Moon* is introduced. Just because a card already in print isn't seeing play now doesn't mean it won't when the metagame shifts. Here are ~~5~~ 4 cards the current leader in the Grand Prix Master standings think will get better in just a few days.


1. [The Greatest Sealed Pool Ever](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-182-the-greatest-sealed-pool-ever/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

This one is worth it just to hear tales of Maria's busted Sealed pool at the *Eldritch Moon* Prerelease. However busted you're thinking, it was better than that. Additionally, Maria and Meghan answer some listener questions and have some fun with flavor text from *Shadows over Innistrad* and *Eldritch Moon*.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Office Hours: Sorin Markov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-q0oLZmj8Y&feature=youtu.be) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

There's a lot of staring in this one. And Sorin goes positively metal. But with hair like that, why wouldn't he?

1. [The BUG with Twelve Legs](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/07/bug-twelve-legs/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Jerry Mee

This article isn't terribly topical—there's no *Eldritch Moon* content to be found—but I found this article about a Legacy Dreadnought/[Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) deck to be really funny and highly entertaining. Heck, the graphics and captions alone were enough to make me chuckle before I had my coffee. Even if Legacy isn't your thing, this is a funny, informative read that's worth your time.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Vintage Super League](https://vintagesuperleague.com/)

We're nearing crunch time in the Vintage Super League. The playoffs loom, the Moxen are shined, and everyone has a [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) primed. Who will rule the evening? Find out at 5 p.m. PT tonight on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> (Cedric) VS Series star, [@RossHunneds](https://twitter.com/RossHunneds), is taking on something much more difficult than Legacy Storm this Friday. [pic.twitter.com/9vTqo0LUqU](https://t.co/9vTqo0LUqU)

Finally! This is the first time we've had a reason to watch *Jeopardy* since Alex Trebek shaved that sweet, sweet mustache.


1. > 
> Here's the POTY race (PTs only) split by pro season rather than by calendar year: <https://t.co/G1X4nFF3Lw> .[@tommartell](https://twitter.com/tommartell)

>  — Quick\_MTGStat (@Quick\_MTGStat) [July 19, 2016](https://twitter.com/Quick_MTGStat/status/755219578284892160)

More Hall of Fame discussion. Players, voters, and people who just generally like talking about this stuff are looking to slice and dice stats any which way that gives them an interesting look at history. In this case, these stats take away Grand Prix points and simply look at Pro Tour success over a calendar (meaning non-season) year.


For anyone curious, I already turned in my vote. But then they told me I couldn't vote for [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), so now I'm not sure what to do.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Blue-Red Tutelage](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13399&writer=TCGplayer+Staff&articledate=7-19-2016)

Remember when [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) decks were all the rage? Pepperid...er, I remember. Because they always trounced my control decks packed with removal.


Well, Seth Manfield wants to bring us back to those harrowing days with a new take on the archetype boosted by some *Eldritch Moon* standouts. [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler) and [Curious Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curious+Homunculus) give the deck reasons to play creatures, while [Scour the Laboratory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scour+the+Laboratory) provides some much-needed card draw. [Nahiri's Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%27s+Wrath) and [Unsubstantiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsubstantiate) keep the board clear and, of course, [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) provides the win condition.


Is this deck good? Maybe. Is it better than a [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice)/[Pyromancer's Goggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) deck? Who knows! But it does look like a lot of fun. For the person playing it. The opponent will probably be miserable.
