John Avon didn't *only* contribute land art to *Ravnica: City of Guilds* (see, for example, [Halcyon Glaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halcyon+Glaze)), but he is of course well-known for his gorgeous and fantastic landscapes. Here are some peeks at John's line drawings that became *Ravnica's* guild cycle of common, double-mana lands. Click the links below each sketch to see the full, final art, and click the card name to see the Gatherer window of the final card. *(Depending on your connection speed, the art may take a few moments to change.)*
