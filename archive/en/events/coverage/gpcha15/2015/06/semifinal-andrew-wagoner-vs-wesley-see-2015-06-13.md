 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






Andrew Wagoner and Wesley See seemed to have a lot in common. Each had earned their first Grand Prix Top 8, and each qualified for Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. Both had defeated their quarterfinals opponents, and brought decks that have been around Modern as long as the format existed.



History often has a way of repeating itself.



**The Decks**



Wagoner’s Affinity represented one half of the classic Modern showdown, using cheap artifacts like [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) and Memnite alongside the staples of [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest), [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion), and [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) to build machines that can kill in just a few hits. Ostensibly an “aggro” deck, it functions similar to combo in that different pieces assemble extraordinary power in a hurry.



See’s deck was also a classic Modern deck: Blue-Red Twin. [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) and [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) have been an inseparable duo since their Standard days, living on with the likes of [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) in Modern. Thanks to a dense control suite of counterspells ([Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)), card draw ([Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions)), and card advantage ([Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)) the deck plays defense and offense well, switching in the blink of an eye to enact it’s combo for the kill.



**The Games**



Wagoner had a light start for Affinity with just [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) on his first turn, and his second turn [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) hit a [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) from See. Content to hold up manam spending [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) or [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) to massage his hand, See played the control game against the potentially explosive artifacts across the way.



Wagoner kept trying spells but See kept them at bay, upping his land count and drawing more cards along the way. [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) was the second spell to make it through See’s shields, and it meant [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) could make mana for the [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast)s hidden in his hand – at least until [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) came along. [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) was the lone creature for awhile, adding to the effectiveness of Remand’s past.



See’s [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) kept attacking, taking life away as [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s kept coming.

*A wall of [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s kept Andrew Wagoner’s machines off the battlefield in their first game.*



“I only cast five this game,” See said before unleashing an end step [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) into main phase [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) to an ever tapped out Wagoner.



It was a pitch perfect play for why the deck had been among the best in Modern since the beginning.



The second game wasn’t as slow a start for Wagoner since this time there was no wall of countermagic to stop him. [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) soon mounted itself to an [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), and [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) threatened to lock out all of See’s deck entirely. [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) joined the fray next, and replaced the Ornithoper as the plated attacker, until [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast) saved the day for See. However, a second [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) equipped to an animated [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) was enough to deal exact lethal damage on the next turn.



The combo kill came back the other way, history repeating again.



See played first in the final game of the match, though Wagoner promised a strong start with [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) and [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal). See looked to slow things down with [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) but there wasn’t more to follow and Wagoner began to deploy his forces: [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb), [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) and more. In response to casting the Ravager, See’s [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast) and [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) took out a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) before he played his own [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite).

*Wesley See worked to buy the time he needed to set his combo up against Wagoner’s growing forces.*



On the defense, [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) helped [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) defray the incoming attacks from Wagoner, blocking [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) like a champ. Drawing into the fourth land he needed, See set his plan into motion: [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) to tap one [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest) with [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). Wagoner began to calculate damage against a tapped out See after moving the Plating to an unblocked Pest.



After Wagoner ran his numbers See fell to one life, then untapped to cast [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) for the win.



“One point,” Wagoner said, shaking his head. “Good games.”



“Yeah. That was a really close one,” See said as he shook Wagoner’s hand.



**Wesley See defeated Andrew Wagoner, 2-1.**
