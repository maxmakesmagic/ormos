**Name:** Christoph Green


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Pharma engineer


**Hometown:** Watford, England


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Multiple Game Day champion.


**Which format and which deck did you play? Why did you play this format and why did you choose this deck?**


Standard—Grixis. Standard because I was the unlucky one. [Glint-Sleeve Siphoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Sleeve+Siphoner) and [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) are too good.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


I think I ripped my vocal chords in my celebration. Like to say thanks to Amy for the support.

**Name:** Ben Jones


**Age:** 20


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Pontypool, Wales


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


2016 national champion. A lot of Magic Online trophies in Modern.


**Which format and which deck did you play? Why did you play this format and why did you choose this deck?**


Modern, Grixis Shadow. I played Modern because I have the most experience in the format. I think people overstate how bad the Jund matchup is, I have been winning a lot online with Shadow.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


My first Pro Tour invite.

**Name:** Charles Eliatamby


**Age:** 19


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** London, England


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Qualified for two Pro Tours. Also multiple Game Day champion.


**Which format and which deck did you play? Why did you play this format and why did you choose this deck?**


I played Eldrazi Stompy in Legacy. I played Legacy because I enjoyed it the most. I was going to play Death and Taxes, but the person I planned on borrowing it off fell through, so I borrowed Eldrazi Stompy instead. I guess it worked out.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


This is my first Grand Prix Top 8/4, so it means the world to me.

**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Winner Grand Prix Lyon, with Thomas. Two Grand Prix Top 4s. 17th at Pro Tour *Rivals of Ixalan*. 17th at Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*.


**Which format and which deck did you play? Why did you play this format and why did you choose this deck?**


I'm playing Standard because Andreas is a Modern master and Thomas is the number one Legacy player in the world. I played Blue-Black Midrange because Matthew Foulkes streamed with it and I got to pick his brain.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


It means a lot. Qualify your best friends for the Pro Tour and get to travel with them! Also playing for pro levels and the Danish captaincy—so the world.

Titan Shift in Modern. I expected a lot of Jund and decks that beat Jund.


**What does this Top 4 mean to you?**


This week was a rollercoaster for me. My dad had to go to the hospital, but thankfully he is home now and I was able to go. He traveled with me to tournaments when I was a kid, so this is for him.

Pro Tour(s) with my friends.

**Which format and which deck did you play? Why did you play this format and why did you choose this deck?**


First, I would like to thank Simon Englund for some advice regarding Standard. Standard was my format as the others had obvious preferneces regarding Modern and Legacy, and Blue-Black Control is an exciting deck. I promise.

Dinner will have to wait.

It means a few more plane tickets!

I will get to play a Pro Tour again, something I've been eager to do.

I dedicate this Top 4 to Marco Cammilluzzi and also to Alessandra, my girlfriend, who always supports me in everything I do.
