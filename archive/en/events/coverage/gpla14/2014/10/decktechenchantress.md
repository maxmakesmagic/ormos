 No. 5 Ivan Floch from the Slovak Republic piloted a U/B Control deck to the Top 8 of Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* last weekend, but he switched to a different deck for this GP: he's playing a green-black deck that combines [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx), [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms), and [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder).
