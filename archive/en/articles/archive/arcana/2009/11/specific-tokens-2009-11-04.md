Sometimes, tokens are generic. The *Zendikar* Bird Token is, frankly, just a bird:

Other times, however, a token moves from the general to the particular. Take, for example, this *Zendikar* Wolf token:

You *could* use it with your [Fable of Wolf and Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fable+of+Wolf+and+Owl) or [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt). But isn't it especially handsome next to [Turntimber Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turntimber+Ranger)?


![Turntimber Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Turntimber+Ranger)Yep. Same wolf.
