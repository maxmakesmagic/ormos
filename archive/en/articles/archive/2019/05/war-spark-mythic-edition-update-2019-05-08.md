We're deeply disappointed with the issues that affected many of you who tried to purchase the limited edition *War of the Spark Mythic Edition*.


eBay will be sending an uncut foil sheet of Mythic and Rare cards from *War of the Spark* to everyone whose order was canceled after receiving a confirmation on May 1. These foil sheets are currently scheduled for production and will be sent out as soon as they are ready. Keep an eye on your inbox; eBay will reach out to each affected customer when these sheets are ready for shipment.


While we recognize this may not make everyone happy, we hope it comes as some consolation to those of you affected.
