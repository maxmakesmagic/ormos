Modern Cube Starts April 4
--------------------------



Modern has spent more time in the spotlight than usual lately, and the Modern Cube is a great way to try out all the iconic cards and synergies that shape one of *Magic*'s most dynamic formats. Modern Cube can be found in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby, and will run through April 20.

*Masters 25* Continues
----------------------


*Masters 25* is still in full swing on *Magic Online*! Offering cards from *every single tournament-legal set ever printed*, the set is overflowing with possible archetypes and synergies. (#crabcombo forever!) What's the weirdest combo (or nonbo) you can put together? We literally don't even know! *Masters 25* is made to be explored, so let your creativity shine.


For more information, and to see the full schedule of *Masters 25* events, check out Alli Medwin's helpful article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/masters-25-plus-treasure-chest-updates-2018-03-06).


 
More Team Modern Super League
-----------------------------


The Team Modern Super League fun continues tonight. We're deep into the season now, and every match is a nail-biter. Even if you've missed every single episode thus far, that's okay! You don't need a "previously on…" recap to enjoy a high-quality *Magic* game, and besides, every episode is archived on [our YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg/videos) so you can catch up whenever you want.


TMSL airs Tuesdays (like this one!) at 5 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about Team Modern Super League [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/tmsl-info/), or check out the video below.
