*Garruk Wildspeaker is a Planeswalker who wields green magic. His specialty is creature magic: spells that coax abundant mana from the land, summon wild beasts, and unleash the ferocity and power of his summoned creatures.*


Garruk is a hunter to the core, a planeswalking predator whose hunting ground is the entire Multiverse. Gripped with a need to test his might and resolve against greater and greater challenges, his life's calling has become an endless hunt of the most ferocious and dangerous game that each plane can offer.


So far Garruk's travels have brought him experiences and trials he never could have imagined. The dangers he's faced have forced his abilities in druidism and creature summoning far past their prior limits, and each day his collection of trophies grows. But recently he's faced a new kind of prey: a fellow planeswalker.


This is new territory for Garruk. Never before has his quarry been so crafty, so resourceful, or so elusive. Garruk's true hunt has just begun.




*Garruk Wildspeaker is a Planeswalker who wields green magic. His specialty is creature magic: spells that coax abundant mana from the land, summon wild beasts, and unleash the ferocity and power of his summoned creatures. But since being cursed by the Chain Veil, his nature spells have been tainted by black magic.*


The Planeswalker Garruk Wildspeaker has always been a skilled hunter, and his calling has been a plane-spanning hunt for the hugest and most powerful creatures in the Multiverse. But now his chosen quarry is a fellow Planeswalker: the death-witch Liliana Vess. At their last meeting, Liliana used the power of the Chain Veil artifact to curse Garruk, corrupting his power to summon wild beasts. As the curse takes hold and Garruk's fierce predator-companions become sickly fiends, he finds that he's gaining new, chilling powers of death. This only enrages him more.


Liliana still carries the shadowy Chain Veil, and Garruk won't stop until he's cured of his intolerable death-tainted state. If he can survive his curse, Garruk will employ his hunter's instincts to track Liliana on the world of Innistrad in the hopes of confronting her.
