And after the Pro Tour, the playoff action for the [Vintage Super League](http://VintageSuperLeague.com/) gets underway! This week will feature a showdown between the third seed in the Top 4, Eric Froehlich, and the fourth seed, Randy Buehler.



The format for the Vintage Super League playoffs is best three out of five *matches*, where each player brings three different decks and a pre-set order in which those decks will be used for the first three matches. Should the showdown go to four or five matches, then the players get to decided which deck they load up.



Tune in to the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) Tuesday, April 14, at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. GMT to catch all of the exciting eternal action!
