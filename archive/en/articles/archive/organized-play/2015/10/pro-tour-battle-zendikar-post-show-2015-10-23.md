The Pro Tour has come and gone, and with it, a new Pro Tour champion has been crowned. It was an all-Japan final match, the first time this has happened since the 2006 World Championships, as Kazuyuki Takimura bested Ryoichi Tamada in the fifth and final game of the weekend.


Pro Tour weekend is always a big occasion, with an outpouring of information and decks that influence a number of events going forward. We're going to take a look at what you can be a part of this weekend, and then we'll take a look at some of the highlights from the Pro Tour.


Game Day!
=========


*Battle for Zendikar* Game Day takes place this weekend. Game Day, a Standard tournament weekend that takes place at local game stores worldwide, always follows the weekend of the Pro Tour and gives you an opportunity to bring your best to your local metagame for a shot at some really cool promos.


Everyone who participates in the *Battle for Zendikar* Game Day gets a sweet full-art [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare):

If you do well at your local Game Day and finish in the Top 8 of your store, you'll also get a [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) full-art promo:

Game Days are a blast, offering a competitive local tournament to scratch your itch to battle right after the Pro Tour takes place. So be sure to find a store near you and show your local scene what you've got to bring to battle!


This Weekend's Grand Prix
=========================


Also following the Pro Tour are two Grand Prix, each showcasing different formats on different continents.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/GP-City-Only-Beijing-Black%202.png)


The first of these is Grand Prix Beijing, featuring the *Battle for Zendikar* Team Limited formats in action. Asia's top players and *Magic* fans will get together in teams of three and tackle Team Sealed Booster Draft, where they build three decks out of twelve *Battle for Zendikar* booster packs. The Top 4 teams will be able to try out the Team Booster Draft format.


Each team that competes in the Grand Prix Beijing main event gets three event-exclusive playmats along with their twelve boosters to use for their three decks, as well as one [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) promo card per person.


If you're not going to be at GP Beijing, we'll have veteran reporter and Silver-status pro Chapman Sim reporting on the latest from the tournament floor, from the top teams and their strategies to the sights and sounds of the Grand Prix. Check back over the weekend for updates!

Also going on this weekend is Grand Prix Quebec City, a Standard continuation from last weekend's Pro Tour Constructed format. What sorts of innovations and metagaming will take place in the Standard Constructed main event in Quebec, and how will players adjust to the top-performing archetypes of the Pro Tour?


All players who participate in the Grand Prix Quebec City main event will receive six *Battle for Zendikar* boosters, a [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) promo, a coupon for a discount on any on-demand event, and a sweet event-exclusive playmat featuring art from the *Battle for Zendikar* card [Veteran Warleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Warleader).
