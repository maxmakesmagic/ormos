Throne of Eldraine: Magic Online Edition
========================================

By Alli Steele











As September rolls to a close, the release of *Throne of Eldraine* looms ever closer. It's so soon now. And as we wind around the last bend in the forest path, you can practically hear the knights clashing at the lists. You'll be able to join them and play the set on *Magic Online* starting Thursday, September 26. As we've done with several sets recently, you'll be able to prepare for your tabletop Prerelease event before heading down there, or simply stay at home and play your heart's fill of *Throne of Eldraine*.


The set will enter the *Magic Online* system with the downtime on Wednesday, September 25. Constructed Leagues will end, then to be reset for the new season and the new set. Standard rotation will also happen then: *Ixalan*, *Rivals of Ixalan*, *Dominaria*, and *Core Set 2019* will be out immediately, and you'll be able to play Standard with older versions of *Throne of Eldraine* reprints immediately. (~~We expect~~ ~~We want~~ There's a chance for [Righteousness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteousness) to have a glorious single day in the sun.)


And then, starting on Thursday morning, September 26 around 10 a.m. PT, the *Throne of Eldraine* events begin. Draft and Sealed will be available immediately. Want to get more familiar with the set? Check out the [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/throne-eldraine) and the [mechanics article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/throne-eldraine-mechanics-2019-09-04).


Other important and useful dates for *Throne of Eldraine* on *Magic Online*:


* Redemption begins October 23.
* The *Throne of Eldraine* redemption guarantee period ends February 5, 2020.
* *Throne of Eldraine* redemption will end on March 11, 2020.

When was the last time we launched only one new thing with a set, though?


Such a Drag
===========


Some of you may be familiar with the term "click count": the number of times you need to click to accomplish a given objective. Generally, the lower your click count, the better; that's not a *perfect* rule, but it's a good indicator of how easy and smooth your interface is.


We've taken steps to reduce click count in various places before over the past several years, in small and large ways:


* We took away a click for cards that asked players to optionally take an action on their choice of game object. As a recent example, take [Cavalier of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalier+of+Night)'s triggered ability "When [Cavalier of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavalier+of+Night) enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature." Under the old system, *Magic Online* would have prompted players to first choose whether to use its ETB trigger at all, then if the player clicked "yes," each creature that could be sacrificed would be available to click, and clicking would sacrifice it. Under the new system, the trigger simply asks the player to click a creature or a "no" button, with the understanding that if the player is clicking a creature to sacrifice it, they're implicitly choosing the "yes" button.
* The new Constructed and Limited scenes dramatically reduce the number of clicks players need to make to get into a game of *Magic*.

In this spirit of making our interface smoother and easier to use, we're pleased to introduce a new feature: **cards in your hand are now** **drag-to-cast**. It works exactly as you would (probably) think: if you want to cast a spell, drag it from your hand to the battlefield using the left mouse button, then release. If it's a land and you have a land play remaining, you'll play the land. If it's a spell and you have exactly the mana to cast it in your pool already, you'll cast it. If you need to activate more mana abilities, you'll get that chance. If you need to make choices (like which mode to choose), you'll get the usual context menu or dialog box to make those choices.


You don't *have* to make a joke here about T3feri mirror matches, but we will: they are indeed such a drag.


Being Adamant About Getting Adamant Bonuses
===========================================


Bear with me if you've heard this one before: so I'm playing in the final round of my *Throne of Eldraine* draft. I've got a sweet Mardu Aggro Knights deck and it's turn four. A few creatures traded last turn and the board is empty. Now I really want to drop a 5/2 Embereth Paladin and [Lava Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe) my opponent to keep the pressure up. My lands: Mountain, Mountain, and both copies of Tournament Grounds in my deck. I tap the lands quickly (holding W to bypass the context menu) and only realize what I did wrong after the Paladin is on the stack and I've already lost my chance to get the free +1/+1 counter. I lose the game, and thus don't go 3-0 in the draft. I miss on qualifying for the next MOCS Prelim by one QP. I can't play in the MOCS because of that, and I don't get to go to the Players Tour because of that, and because of *that*, I lose out on a PT win that would have kicked my *Magic* career into super high gear for years and years.


That kind of thing happens to everyone, I know.


Nobody should ever have that happen to them, though. And we've got a plan for that: when it comes to adamant bonuses, *Magic Online* will have a kind of "training wheels" support option. When you go to cast your spell with adamant, you'll see a second option on your cast menu: "Cast (with adamant support)." Choose this option, and you're protected from accidents like those in the story above. If you try to cast your spell and the mana you tap doesn't meet the adamant requirement, you'll get an error message in the prompt box and be unable to complete casting your spell. You'll be free to hit the "Cancel" button to undo all your mana abilities and return to the point just before you started casting the spell.


In addition, we've added additional information in the prompt box for all spells that care about what color of mana was spent to cast them to tell you what mana has already been applied to the spell you're trying to cast. This is especially relevant for adamant, of course, but also several cards from older sets: the ten-card *Shadowmoor*/*Eventide* cycle of hybrid cards that includes [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) and [Invert the Skies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invert+the+Skies), every card with sunburst or converge, and the 20-card cycle from original *Ravnica* block that includes [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar) and [Vigor Mortis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis). This adds a click, but we believe this click is worthwhile to make sure that you're casting the spell how you want to cast it.


Let's see what that looks like in action:


![start casting embereth](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/start%20casting%20embereth.png)


Now tap a Mountain . . .


![casting embereth 1](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/casting%20embereth%201.png)


. . . and a Forest . . .


![casting embereth 2](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/casting%20embereth%202.png)


. . . and a Swamp . . .


![casting embereth 3](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/casting%20embereth%203.png)


. . . and a Tournament Grounds for the first ability . . .


![adamant support stoppage](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/adamant%20support%20stoppage.png)


. . . and you'll get stopped. You need to pay three R to cast with adamant support. If you hadn't use the "Cast (with adamant support)" option, though, you'd see this instead:


![casting embereth 4](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/casting%20embereth%204.png)


There's still time to realize your mistake here, but why take the risk? If you want to be confident that you're casting the adamant spell for full value, I recommend using the adamant support cast option.


Single-Card Stories: Sundering Stroke
=====================================


![Sundering Stroke](https://media.wizards.com/2019/eld/en_5r37zHDMDc.png)


I'll start by saying that I *hate* this card. Not because of anything wrong with the card (it's kinda nuts, especially with Irencrag Feat), but because it's going to confuse people—and as a former judge and a *Magic Online* designer and product manager, I know that's going to lead to upset players and understandable reimbursement requests.


It's worth talking about this card some just to clear things up and prevent confusion.


First, yes, it doesn't *technically* have adamant. Saying that it's not an adamant spell is the best kind of correct, but as far as the *Magic Online* rules engine is concerned, it *does* have adamant. It's got the adamant support cast option, it shows you what mana you've applied to the spell as you're casting it, everything.


Second, even if you're casting for adamant support, you need to divide damage. Even if there's a self-replacement that's going to happen, part of casting the spell involves dividing up the damage between targets. That's just part of the rules of *Magic*. (Specifically, the process of casting spells is governed by rule 601, and dividing damage is covered in rule 601.2d.) Like other effects that divide damage between targets, targeting comments will appear on the target(s) to make it clear what's being affected and how. If it was cast for seven R, it'll even specify 7 damage in addition to the division amount.


![sundering stroke targeting](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/sundering%20stroke%20targeting.png)


Third, the division amount is still important because we're living in a world that's full of spell-copying effects. And if you copy a Sundering Stroke that was cast with seven R, you may become *very* disappointed. Thanks to rule 706.10, a copy of a spell isn't cast, and since your copy wasn't cast, it can't have been cast for seven R. And thanks to that same rule, the number of targets and division of damage between them can't change for the copy, even if the targets themselves change (as most spell-copy effects allow). So, if you're copying the Sundering Stroke shown in that image, you're not going to get three targets for 7 damage each; you're going to get one target hit for 4, one target hit for 1, and one target hit for 2. That's not bad, but it's not what every copy effect dreamed of when they were little.


So maybe I don't hate it. I mean, I forced mono-red every-color in *Shadowmoor* and *Eventide* drafts just because [Jaws of Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaws+of+Stone) is great. I like dividing absurd amounts of damage, and Sundering Stroke lets me toss 21 points of damage around, even if it is limited. I hate the fact that some people are going to be unpleasantly surprised by this card, and hopefully this digression helps.


The Avatars of Eldraine
=======================


Six new avatars are being introduced with *Throne of Eldraine*.


[New accounts](#hearye) will get the new The Royal Scions avatar. This will also be in the Deck Builder's Essentials for *Throne of Eldraine* for those players who already have accounts and are interested in showing off the twins Will and Rowan.


![The Royal Scions Avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/The%20Royal%20Scions%20Avatar.png)


In Treasure Chests, you'll be able to find these two cuties: the Flaxen Intruder avatar and the Inquisitive Puppet avatar. These replace the previous Treasure Chest avatars, but unlike those avatars, these *are* tradeable. If you want these, you can trade for them with other players in addition to opening them in Treasure Chests. You can tell the difference because the treasure chest symbol indicates untradeability, while the Planeswalker fork indicates that it can be freely traded.


![Flaxen Intruder Avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/Flaxen%20Intruder%20Avatar.png)![Inquisitive Puppet Avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/Inquisitive%20Puppet%20Avatar.png)


And for those players who do well in events, we have three prestige avatars as usual. As with *Core Set 2020*, players will earn Competitive and Friendly trophies for doing well in events (see individual events for details). At the end of the season, each Friendly trophy is worth 1 point, each Competitive trophy is worth 5 points, and each prestige avatar is based on a simple point threshold.


For this set, the uncommon prestige avatar (5 points) will be the new Planeswalker, Oko, ~~Haver of Many Abs~~ Thief of Crowns.


![Oko, Thief of Crowns Prestige Avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/Oko,%20Thief%20of%20Crowns%20Prestige%20Avatar.png)


At rare, and a 20-point threshold, a prestige avatar celebrating the removal of Garruk's Liliana-and-the-Chain-Veil-imposed curse: the Garruk Restored prestige avatar.


![Garruk Restored Prestige Avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/Garruk%20Restored%20Prestige%20Avatar.png)


The mythic rare prestige avatar for *Throne of Eldraine* season, available to players who reach a 40-point threshold, is the Rowan Kenrith prestige avatar featuring the stunning Magali Villeneuve art you've probably seen elsewhere.

Alternative Play Calendar, or, "If We're Going Back to High Fantasy Already . . ."
==================================================================================


For the *Throne of Eldraine* alternative play season, we're going to try something new and different: a series of blasts from the past. And by that, I mean *way* in the past. For this season, we're introducing several *non-Phantom* events into the schedule, but all events listed below are Phantom unless stated otherwise.


* **October 9–16**: ***Masters Edition*.** This is the *original* *Masters Edition*, starring *original* art from the earliest *Magic* sets. And it's using the *original* Draft style: this is no Phantom flashback. When you draft these cards, they're added to your collection.
* **October 16–23**: **Chaos Draft.** Chaos Draft is great, but it's best when it's a new experience each time. So, to shake things up, we're going to include only Standard-legal sets from *Return to Ravnica* forward to *Throne of Eldraine*.
* **October 23–30**: ***Masters Edition II*.** Just like the *Masters Edition* draft two weeks earlier, this one will have players keeping the cards they draft. Try casting [Burnout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burnout) on your opponent's [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). It's as much fun as it sounds!
* **October 30–November 6**: ***Innistrad* Flashback.** For Halloween week, we're sticking to our tradition and drafting the spookiest format around: no *Shadows over*, no *Dark Ascension*, just original *Innistrad*. Friendly suggestion—the [Spider Spawning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning) deck will almost certainly be overdrafted. Try drafting something else.
* **November 6–13**: ***Masters Edition III*.** Keep what you draft in this non-Phantom revisit of the set starring most of the cast of *Portal: Three Kingdoms*. Horsemanship really is the new flying.
* **November 13–20: *Legacy Cube*.** There's always room for the beloved *Legacy Cube*, updated with new *Throne of Eldraine* cards.
* **November 20–27: *Masters Edition IV*.** The last of the original *Masters* sets, this fourth installment rounds out the mini-series of keep-what-you-draft Flashbacks.
* **November 27–December 4: *Modern Horizons*.** This fan-favorite set will return in both Phantom *and* non-Phantom Leagues for this week. These events will accept *Modern Horizons* Tokens as entry but will not be distributing more of them. Individual tokens will return to the store if you don't have enough to use the ones you have.
* **December 4–11: *Vintage Masters*.** These Draft Leagues aren't Phantom. More importantly, they have the *Limited Edition (Alpha)* art for the Power Nine. If you don't have a Christopher Rush [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), this is a great opportunity to potentially pick one up in Draft.
* **December 11–???: *Vintage Cube*.** While Cube drafts are Phantom, they're, well, still *Cube drafts*. Play the most popular cube from December 11 all the way until the release of *Theros Beyond Death* in January.

Hear Ye, Hear Ye: The New Era of No-Fee *Magic Online* Accounts Begins
======================================================================


Delivering with our *Throne of Eldraine* release, we're happy to announce *Magic Online* is removing the $9.99 fee to create a *Magic Online* account. What exactly does this mean?


Starting after the downtime on September 25, we'll be eliminating both the online account creation system on our website and the separate free trial servers. Instead, players will be able to download *Magic Online* and create their own basic account for no fee, including choosing their own screen name, from the game client.


This basic account includes hundreds of cards that players can use to build decks and battle as much as they want in the casual play areas. Opening the New Player Starter Kit gives you two of every common and one of every uncommon currently legal in Standard, as well as two player avatars, [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and a seasonal avatar, which for *Throne of Eldraine* is The Royal Scions. The basic account can only have 20 different decks at any given time, but that is enough to build a few decks in a variety of formats.



![Scions Art](https://media.wizards.com/2019/images/daily/HaLV2MqAsU.jpg)The Royal Scions | Art by: [Paul Scott Canavan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22paul%20scott%20canavan%22%5D)
The New Player Starter Kit also includes 20 New Player Points, which can be used to enter events designed for players who are new to *Magic Online*. These events give players a taste of *Magic Online* events to help them decide if they want to upgrade from a basic account to a full account (more on that later). With this in mind, we're also adjusting our new player events to better suit players looking to expand into types of play *Magic Online* offers while minimizing wait times for these events.


First, we're replacing the four-player draft with a *Core Set 2020* Phantom Sealed Deck League. This league will let players familiarize themselves with the deck builder to build a deck and then battle other players in three single-game matches. Because this is a League, you can take as long as you need to build your deck, and then when you're ready you can join the queue to battle other players on your schedule. Note that this is a Phantom League, so the cards you play with are not added to your collection.


Second, we're replacing the Planeswalker Deck Gauntlet with a New Player Modern Gauntlet League. This gauntlet will randomly assign you one of six different Modern decks that are representative of several archetypes available in Modern and then let you play three multi-game matches. The decks include sideboards and are designed to give players who are new to *Magic Online*, and who may be new to deeper non-rotating formats like Modern, a taste of what the format is like.


Designed by our R&D Play Design team, the decks include the following possibilities:


* Mono-Red Burn: Fight fire (and essentially everything) with fire and burn your opponent's face off.
* Izzet Storm: Bide your time until you can cast all the spells and burn your opponent's face off. Make sure to hold CTRL to respond to your own spells as you cast them!
* Gruul Titanshift: Ramp, ramp, ramp until you can [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) into [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) and several Mountains to burn your opponent's face off (we're sensing a theme here).
* Jeskai Control: Avoid getting your face burned off and control the early game until you can take over the late game with Teferi.
* Dimir Mill: Prevent your opponent from burning your face off by putting their entire library into their graveyard.
* Mono-White Blink: Start aggressive with low-cost creatures and then blink them for even more value . . . also, something, something face burning.

Basic Accounts vs. Full Accounts
================================


While the basic account will provide hours of fun, there are a few restrictions. Basic accounts will not be able to chat, trade, or directly challenge other players. While it may seem odd that these features are restricted, there is too much risk with no-fee accounts using these features to disrupt other players' experiences, and we want to limit those opportunities. These accounts will be able to add buddies and block players as needed.


While basic accounts can't use some of these features, they can respond to them, including direct challenges and clan invitations. This means if you currently are a MTGO player and have some friends who want to try the basic account, you can create a clan and invite those friends to it or challenge them to matches directly and they will be able to respond. Chat, however, will remain restricted unless initiated by a *Magic Online* administrator.


Basic accounts are able redeem any promo codes they receive and enter any events they meet the entry requirement for. For instance, if a player earns 20 Play Points through a couple New Player Modern Gauntlet courses, that player could use those points to join a Standard two-player queue.


Finally, the full *Magic Online* store is only available to players who have purchased the Account Upgrade Kit. The kit costs $9.99 and includes two additional copies of every common and one more of each uncommon currently legal in Standard\*, 100 Play Points, and 10 more New Player Points. Once you've upgraded, you'll be able to trade, chat, and purchase other items from the *Magic Online* Store and experience the full breadth of options *Magic Online* offers!


It is also worth noting that basic accounts that go longer than three months without logging in may be deactivated. If this happens, product earned through play will be lost and the screen name will be released back to the public. Basic accounts that stay active or convert to full accounts will not be affected in this way.


*\*Note that the contents of the kit change to match Standard legality when they are opened. This means upgrades that happen a long time after a basic account may have different cards than those that came with the basic account.* 


New Client Updates
==================


We're also shipping some additional updates to the *Magic Online* game client. On the Login scene, we've reorganized the page to better use the space and added links to our website and social media pages. In a future update, we'll also add server information to the login page, so you know when we're down for maintenance.


The Home Scene gets a more substantial update, including removing our text announcements and replacing them with a larger, visual message space. This lets us call attention to the things you need to know, like our current Spotlight Event or Cube. In a later update, this will become a carousel that allows us to host several messages and let you scroll through them, similar to the way *MTG Arena* presents its news.


We've also adjusted where the buddies and clan information lives. In a future update we'll revise the visuals to better match the newer *Magic Online* aesthetic. The features will remain the same, but we want to present the information more clearly.


Finally, the MTGO Store has also been updated. Beyond updating the visuals, we've simplified the navigation to consist of Featured items (your Event Tickets and booster packs), Deck products (like Deck Builder's Essentials and Planeswalker Decks), and Redemption.
