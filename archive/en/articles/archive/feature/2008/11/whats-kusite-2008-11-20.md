Let's talk about kusites for a moment. The most famous kusite (some would say the *only* kusite) is the [Ridged Kusite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ridged+Kusite) from *Planar Chaos*:

So where did this mysterious kusite come from? Well, the rumor is that it was originally seen way back in the *Weatherlight* expansion...



![Guided Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guided+Strike)

Of course, since [Ridged Kusite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ridged+Kusite) turns any card into a [Guided Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guided+Strike), it's no surprise that its name comes from there as well.
