Khan You See Who I See?

 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 






So here's a bit of fun. Let's look at how many times (according to art descriptions) a khan appears in card art in *Khans of Tarkir*.



Anafenza, the Foremost
======================



The khan of Abzan is in exactly one card. Hers:

[Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) | Art by [James Ryman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22James+Ryman%22%5d)



There are several art descriptions that refer *to* her, but none others that request her presence. Maybe she's camera shy.



Narset, Enlightened Master
==========================



On the other hand, Narset appears in three cards. First, of course, is her own:

But Narset is also known for quietly contemplating the world around her…

…and for shattering the fists of Mardu warriors with her palm…that deflects…things.

Ouch.



Sidisi, Brood Tyrant
====================



And just like Anafenza, Sidisi isn't one to photobomb. So she appears in her card and no others:

…but…

Her HAT appears in another card. Ha!



Zurgo Helmsmasher
=================



The Mardu khan appears on three cards. First, his own:

He's known to utterly end opponents…

…and to absolutely despise Sarkhan:

Surrak Dragonclaw
=================



And finally, what of the Temur khan? Well, Surrak makes an appearance on two cards. First is his:

[Surrak Dragonclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrak+Dragonclaw) | Art by [Jaime Jones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Jaime+Jones%22%5d)



But that's NOT the card he's most famous for. Nay, indeed, Surrak features pretty prominently on what is perhaps the most famous and beloved piece of card art in *Khans of Tarkir*: Bear Punch.



Oop, I mean:
