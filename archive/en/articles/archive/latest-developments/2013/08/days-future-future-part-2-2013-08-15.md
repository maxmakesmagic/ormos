Welcome to another edition of Days of Future Future. This time, Part 2—Standards That Never Were. If you want to know more about what the Future Future League is, you can catch up by reading the first "[Days of Future Future" article](https://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/251). 

 While the Future Future League has a reasonable idea of what Standard will look like when the set comes out in the real world, it does so by seeing many possible different futures. We have some ability to choose what Standard is going to be about in the upcoming year by deciding which cards are powerful and doing good work (and generally worth taking a risk on), and which ones are not. If the Future Future League took no risks whatsoever, then **Magic** would get pretty boring. It's all about calculated ones. 

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ld/ld260_burningvengeance.jpg)[Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) | Art by [Raymond Swanland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=[%22Raymond Swanland%22])

 We do this by playing with the cards as they are getting near the end of the development process, and figuring out which are too strong by themselves, or which ones are just giving too much to one deck. What we want is to create a metagame that is diverse and robust, and the only good way to do that is make sure that no one deck gets too many of the strong cards in a set. At times, there are cards that people have commented would've been better if they had some small tweak, and in many of those instances (such as [Liliana of the Dark Realm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Dark+Realm)'s starting loyalty), they began at the value people were expecting, and we shifted them because we felt that the change overall helped Standard, even though it hurt that one card. All of this, of course, means that we have lived through versions of Standard where very different decks were dominating, often ones that you as the public will never see. During *Innistrad*, for example, the [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) deck was (for a time) the strongest deck in our environment. We made some adjustments to keep the deck from being as dominant as it was, and as a result of that, plus a few decks being stronger than we expected, the deck never really emerged as a top competitor. Which is to be expected. If our small group of playtesters can divine exactly what Standard will look a year in the future, then we just haven't made the environment complex enough to be interesting. 

When playing in the FFL, the adjustment of cards can lead to a certain amount of frustration when, unlike in the real world, your reward for breaking something or creating the best deck in the format isn't to win a tournament, but instead it is often to see some card in it tweaked. It's all part of the job, though, and you get used to focusing, not on your favorite individual decks and cards, but on an overall feeling of what Standard plays like, and trying to make sure there are plenty of fun and interesting things going on in that format. One of the goals of the FFL is to play through as many different weird and crazy decks, as well as pretty normal ones, as possible, and make sure that we aren't printing anything that is going to dominate the format. In more common terms, we throw a lot at the wall and see what sticks.

Sometimes, we deem it necessary to change cards around. Cards get mana added or changed, they gain or lose abilities like trample, or get new wordings if there is an interaction we don't like. It's not all weakening, though. It could be that a card is fun, but a little weak, and we can add a toughness to get it over the hump of dying to the most common removal spells in the format. We try to not remove a card from an expert-level expansion by the time it gets to the FFL, but there are times it needs to happen. By the time the cards get to the Future Future League for testing, most of them have been through Limited testing, have art, and, in any case, we don't always have something really good to replace them with. We can redesign cards if it is absolutely necessary, but we try to fix what we can in the smallest ways possible, to keep Limited in check.

That can be a little different when dealing with a core set, because many of the cards we are dealing with are reprints, and we can't exactly tweak the numbers on the old cards if they aren't working out in the current Standard environment. For that reason, the exact reprints in each core set fluctuates a bit more than with new cards. We can feel safe taking a larger risk with a reprint before the set gets to the FFL, because replacing it is much easier.

 One example of a card that we tried to reprint was [Ranger of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos). The card was exciting and memorable, but its power is directly tied to the number and power of one-drop creatures that it could get in Standard. Standard has quite a few right now.
