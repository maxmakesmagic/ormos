 I tested mostly with Ben Rubin. Lots of other testing with other Baller Beach House members, including Williams, Reitzl, Parke, Wiegersma, Herberholz, Boeken, and Burdick.


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

 Esper beatdown- "Esper Stoneblade." I got the list from Neil Reeves two days before the event and wanted to play something besides Jund.

 Bloodbraid totally warps the format. I had maindeck Ethersworn Canonists and Vedalken Outlanders and lots of evasion creatures.

 Try to draft aggressive Esper blue-white, but mostly play an aggressive deck with good mana. Two colors with a light splash.


**What was the best non-Magic thing you did in Hawaii this week?**

 I’m playing five colour control because with control you can control the game.

 I have no strategy, I’m waiting for signals.
