M***agic** 2014* is coming up next month, and here's a little sneak peek with a look at just what its packaging will look like! Your first chance to look at and play with a lot of new cards from ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* will be the upcoming ***Magic** 2014—Duels of the Planeswalkers*. We'll be going into previews for the set in a month for the first week of July and it will be on sale starting July 19, 2013!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1247_booster4.jpg)Oooh now this one is definitely not obvious. What the heck is that thing?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1247_boosterbox.jpg)Sure you all look at booster packs, but the way you all will come to see ***Magic** 2014 Core Set* the most is clearly with packs in a box, like above.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1247_fatpack.jpg)And then of course is the beloved fat pack, which shows off a number of our awesome Chandra artwork. She's kind of a big deal with this core set, in case you didn't know.
