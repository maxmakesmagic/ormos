Thousands Of Eternal Masters Play Legacy At Grand Prix Columbus!
================================================================




After nine rounds of Legacy, only six players remain undefeated as we enter the second day of competition: Jamie Naylor, Steven Iucci, Brian Rockenbach, Thomas Smiley, Daniel Weisser, and Joe Lossett.
















GRAND PRIX COLUMBUS 2016
------------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



This morning, 1824 Eternal Masters arrived in Columbus with dreams of hoisting a trophy in the air. The players battled their way through nine rounds of Legacy and only those with the best records have earned the right to return tomorrow morning for another six rounds of Legacy before we cut to the Top 8 Elimination rounds. Only six players emerged from Day 1 with undefeated records: Jamie Naylor, Steven Iucci, Brian Rockenbach, Thomas Smiley, Daniel Weisser, and Joe Lossett.


The field of decks looked wildly diverse this morning, but Miracles decks using Counterbalance in tandem with Sensei’s Divining Top seem to be rising to the top of the standings. Countless strategies including Grixis Delver, Burn, Eldrazi, and even Food Chain decks still have horses in the race. What decks will be left standing after another six rounds of Legacy? Stay tuned to continuing coverage of Grand Prix Columbus!
