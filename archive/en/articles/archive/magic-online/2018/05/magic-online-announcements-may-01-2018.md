*Magic Online* Conduct Policy Updated
-------------------------------------


In our ongoing effort to make *Magic Online* a fun, safe, inclusive experience, we're making some updates to how we handle code-of-conduct violations and toxic player behavior. To learn all about those updates, and the reasoning behind them, check out [Chris Kiritz's new article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-conduct-update-2018-05-01).


Team Modern Super League: ACTUAL Finals
---------------------------------------


Did you think it was over? GOTCHA! In either a legendary prank or possibly an error in communication (the world may never know), we incorrectly informed you that last week would be the finals of Team Modern Super League. However, the *actual* finals are in fact tonight. It is really, truly your last chance to watch the action live this season. For real this time.


As always, TMSL begins at 5 p.m. PT tonight (Tuesday) on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about Team Modern Super League [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/tmsl-info/). Missed an episode, or all of them? Catch all the episodes on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg/videos).


Team Vintage Super League Every Thursday
----------------------------------------


As TMSL wraps up, TVSL is getting into full swing. The "Conqueror" format is the same as TMSL, with team-based deck-building rules, deck bannings, and play-till-you-lose tournament structure. The main difference, of course, is that the teams are playing Vintage, so expect insanely powerful cards and interactions every step of the way. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!


TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).


MOCS Playoff Event May 5
------------------------


This Saturday, May 5, brings a much-anticipated *Magic Online* Championship Series Playoff Event to MTGO! The format will be Modern, and things will kick off at 7 a.m. PT. Only players who have qualified via a recent MOCS Monthly Event are eligible for entry, and the winner will receive (among other things) invitations to both the 2018 *Magic Online* Championship and Pro Tour "Spaghetti."


Learn more about MOCS events [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2018-magic-online-championship-series).


MOCS Monthly Event May 6
------------------------


Sunday, May 6, a MOCS Monthly Event will take place, beginning at 7 a.m. The format will be Phantom *Dominaria* Sealed Deck. Players can enter with 35 Qualifier Points, and top finishers will qualify for the MOCS Playoff Event on June 28.

*Magic Online* Format Challenges Every Weekend—Now Including Brawl
------------------------------------------------------------------


The *Magic Online* Format Challenges continue every weekend for Modern, Vintage, 1v1 Commander, Legacy, and Pauper formats—and, in case you missed it, a brand-new offering: 1v1 Brawl!
