Now that there are less people in the field, I have more time between drafts to bring you some numbers here from Nice. Previously I revealed how many of each color combination of deck were played, but this time I went one step further, and calculated the exact match win percentage for each deck! This time around there were 116 players in the field, of which none played Blue/Red or Green/White. Let's have the numbers speak for themselves. As usual, all percentages are rounded to the nearest one tenth.

COLOR BREAKDOWN (Ranked by number played) Decks with Black: 72 Total (62.1% of the field)  
 Decks with Green: 61 Total (52.6% of the field)  
 Decks with Blue: 59 Total (50.9% of the field)  
 Decks with Red: 53 Total (45.7% of the field)  
 Decks with White: 37 Total (31.9% of the field)

DECK BREAKDOWN (Ranked by number played)  
 1) G/R: 17 Decks (14.7%)  
 2) B/U: 13 Decks (11.2%)  
 3) B/R: 10 Decks (8.6%)  
 3) B/R/G:10 Decks (8.6%)  
 5) B/U/W:9 Decks (7.7%)  
 6) B/U/G: 8 Decks (6.9%)  
 7) G/U/W: 7 Decks (6.0%)  
 8) B/G: 6 Decks (5.2%)  
 8) U/W: 6 Decks (5.2%)  
 10) B/W: 5 Decks (4.3%)

 17)B/U/G/W:1 Deck (0.9%)  
 17) R/W: 1 Deck (0.9%)  
 17) G/R/W: 1 Deck (0.9%)  
 21) G/W and U/R: None were played.

COLOR BREAKDOWN (Ranked by winning percentage)  
 Decks with Blue: 132-108 (55%)  
 Decks with Black: 147-136 (51.9%)  
 Decks with Red: 105-104 (50.2%)  
 Decks with White: 68-72 (48.6%)  
 Decks with Green: 119-128 (48.2%)

DECK BREAKDOWN (Ranked by winning percentage)  
 1) R/W: 4-0 (100%), 1 Undefeated  
 2) B/U/G/W: 4-0 (100%), 1 Undefeated  
 3) B/U/R: 11-5 (68.8%)  
 4) B/U: 34-18 (65.4%), 2 Undefeated  
 5) R/U/G: 12-8 (60%), 1 Undefeated  
 6) U/W: 15-9 (57.7%), 1 Undefeated  
 7) B/R: 22-18 (55%), 1 Undefeated, 1 Winless  
 8) B/G: 12-12 (50%)  
 8) U/G: 10-10 (50%), 1 Winless  
 8) B/W/G: 4-4 (50%)  
 8) R/U/W: 4-4 (50%)  
 8) G/R/W: 2-2 (50%)

 16) B/W: 9-11 (45%)  
 17) B/R/G: 16-19 (45.7%)  
 18) B/U/G: 14-18 (43.8%)  
 19) G/U/W: 11-17 (39.3%), 1 Winless  
 20) B/R/W: 2-10 (16.7%), 1 Winless

As you can see, although Red/Green was by far the most played deck, it had a horrible win percentage. Of the decks that had multiple copies played, Blue/Black variants seem to be the safest bet. There were nine players who went undefeated, and seven who didn't win a match (five of them went 0-4, two of them went 0-3 drop).
