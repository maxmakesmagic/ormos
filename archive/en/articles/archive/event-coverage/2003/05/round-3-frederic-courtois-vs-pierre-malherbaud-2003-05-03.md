Pierre is the only player to win French Nationals twice, as well as having had a few top 32s on the Pro Tour. Frederic has come tenth at a team Pro Tour and a Grand Prix, and is also notorious from Cephalid Sea Food Restaurant (one of the top clans on Magic Online) whose message is 'Featuring Grand Prix top 32 Frederic Courtois.

### Game 1

![Tephraderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tephraderm)Pierre went first and made a morph and a [Skirk Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider). This was a red-green mirror match. Fred played a turn three [Wirewood Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage) and a turn four [Wirewood Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald). Pierre's play of just a morph on his fifth turn suggested his hand wasn't that great.Courtois dropped a [Tephraderm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tephraderm) and drew a card from the Savage. Malherbaud made both [Elvish Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Vanguard) and [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf). The Vanguard was killed by [Crested Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn) as Courtois drew another card from the Savage. Malherbaud had no answer or the card advantage, all he could do was drop an [Elvish Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior).

When Courtois played [Krosan Vorine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Vorine) and [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher), drawing yet another card, Pierre conceded. The board was looking very bad for him, but the concession seemed a little premature since both players were still on twenty life.

### Game 2

Pierre mulliganed a hand containing five lands and two off-color morphs, whistling as he did so. He seemed in surprisingly high spirits given the kicking he had received in Game 1. He began with an [Elvish Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Vanguard). Frederic stalled on two lands and all he could cast was a [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher).

Pierre beat down with a morph and the Vanguard as he was also short on land. If he drew a fourth it would be game over as he had [Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler) in hand, but he had to cycle a [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) to find one so it could only be cast as a 3/3.

Courtois drew his third land giving him a choice between [Wirewood Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage) (pumping the Vanguard), or a morph. He played the Savage which was immediately [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ed. Pierre played an [Elvish Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior) as well, increasing his Vanguard to 4/4, and Fredric scooped.

### Game 3

![Canopy Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Canopy+Crawler)Frederic got off to a quick start with a second turn [Stonewood Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invoker), third turn morph, and fourth turn Vorine. The Invoker traded with Pierre's off-color [Riptide Biologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Biologist). Malherbaud's fourth turn was pretty good, though. He made a [Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler) and amplified it with [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler), [Crested Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn), and a second Crawler!Frederic could actually kill the Crawler since his morph was [Patron of the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild). He also dropped a [Wirewood Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald). Pierre played the second Crawler as a 4/4, then traded his Craghorn for Fred's [Tephraderm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tephraderm). He also had a [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) for a [Wirewood Savage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage). Courtois used a [Wirewood Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald) as a chump-blocker, but unfortunately, didn't use it to search his library for an elf. "Don't write this," he pleaded to no avail. Pierre started attacking with a [Skirk Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider) and a [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) which were all but impossible to block because of the [Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler). Fred played a few chump blockers but as all he drew was Elves, nothing was capable of dealing with the potentially 6/6 attackers, he was soon forced to concede.

**Final Result:** Pierre Malherbaud defeats Frederic Courtois 2-1
