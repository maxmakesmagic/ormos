The United States and Mexico share a long border, and players from the two countries frequent nearly all the same events in North America. In other words, these two countries are plenty used to competing against each other.


So, naturally, they flew halfway across the world to do it.


And there couldn't be more on the line. As both teams sat down for the first round of the final group stage, they did so in vastly different situations. As the top seed of the group, Mexico has multiple avenues to finish in the Top 8 of the tournament and return on Sunday. The United States, as team captain and No. 1 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald put it, has been playing from the bottom of the standings all weekend. As the fourth seed in the pool, the Americans would likely need to 3-0 the group to advance to play on Sunday.

The Decks
=========



In Seat A, Emmanuel Ramirez Sanchez was handling what has become the most reliable archetype in Standard: Abzan Midrange. Across from him sat the United States' Andrew Baeckstrom wielding its opposite: the explosive but vulnerable White-Blue Heroic.


Next to them was Mexico's Marcelino Freeman wielding Mardu Midrange trying to take down the world's top-ranked player in Turtenwald and his Black-Green Constellation deck featuring showstoppers such as [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant) and [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). And on the end Adrian Luna brought Temur Midrange to battle Neal Oliver's Jeskai Tokens list.


The Games
=========


As Freeman drew a perfect opener and quickly knocked off Turtenwald to put Mexico up a game, the other two matches settled in for the long haul.


Oliver was able to get out early with the namesake of his deck courtesy of [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), but those were quickly outclassed by the [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) that Luna responded with. A [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) to kill the Dragon and then a [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) gave Oliver a path back into the game, but [Fanatic of Xenagos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Xenagos) joined to continue to pressure his life total and bring the American closer to [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws) range.


That is, until a timely [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) allowed Oliver to both attack for 6 damage with his tokens and more importantly regain some of the life he lost. Now comfortably back in double digits, he was able to chain burn spells to finish off the Polukranos and then finish off the game with his tokens.


There was some back-and-forth in Oliver's game, but it had nothing on the game Baeckstrom and Sanchez were playing.


Things started off slower than the Heroic deck would like. Sanchez was on the play and was the first to the board with a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), which began trading damage with a [Battlewise Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Hoplite) from Baeckstrom. With both life totals beginning to dwindle, the two players began to go in opposite directions.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/r11_mexico.jpg)*Mexico started off strong in their matches, but things quickly halted in the other matches.* 




For Sanchez, that meant going wide. [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), another [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and then a [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) meant he could attack for quite a bit of damage. A giant attack left Baeckstrom at 5 life and moved Sanchez back to 17.



For Baeckstrom, it meant going vertical. He began to load enchantments onto his [Hero of Iroas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Iroas) and continuously growing it. [Heliod's Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Pilgrim) found an [Ordeal of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) that both pumped the Hero enough to take down Sorin while also restoring Baeckstrom's life total. A pair of [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite)s found their way onto the board to chump block the following turn while the Hero picked up a [Stratus Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stratus+Walk) and closed the life total to 12-5 in Mexico's favor.


The Pilgrim-into-[Ordeal of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) trick was so effective Baeckstrom decided to repeat it the next turn, and Sanchez was forced to [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) the now-12/12 Hero simply to survive. But the move also restored Baeckstrom's life total to 14 yet again, and when Sanchez couldn't find a way to deal that much damage the next turn he was forced to scoop up his cards.


Meanwhile, Oliver put the Americans up a match as he took advantage of a mana-light Luna to swarm over him with tokens. That shifted the attention back to Turtenwald and Freeman, who were locked in a Game 3 that could decide the entire match.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/2014WMC/r11_usa.jpg)*The United States need a 3-0 to ensure a Top 8 appearance,but with the number one ranked player of the world as their captain, anything is possible.* 




Both players enjoyed strong starts in the decider. Freeman opened with [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) into [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), while Turtenwald had the optimal [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid)-[Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) start.



The first real haymaker came a few turns later when Turtenwald found [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant) to clear away all of Freeman's tokens. Freeman responded with a removal spell for the Giant and a [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) to begin to repopulate his side of the board, but Turtenwald had survived the early rush and hit the magical mark of seven mana.


That means [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). And then a second [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen). More than enough to make the [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) Freeman found look silly. With the battlefield lost, Freeman began to take the direct route, with a [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) knocking Turtenwald to 1 life and giving Freeman a chance to draw more burn for the win.


It was a good plan, and one that could easily have worked had Turtenwald not found [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) to immediately pull himself out of the danger zone. A swarm of bees later, and the Americans had completed the first step on their final journey to claim a Top 8 berth.
