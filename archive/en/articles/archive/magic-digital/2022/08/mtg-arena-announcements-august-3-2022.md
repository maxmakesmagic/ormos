Mythic Constructed and Limited Leaderboard Issue

Last week, we encountered an issue that caused the Mythic Constructed leaderboard to work off incorrect player standings. After further investigation, we have found a similar issue that also impacted the Mythic leaderboard for ranked Limited play shortly after the release. You can read more on this and the adjustments we'll be making in the [update to the July 2022 *MTG Arena* Ranked Season](https://www.magic.gg/news/update-to-the-july-2022-mtg-arena-ranked-season) article.
