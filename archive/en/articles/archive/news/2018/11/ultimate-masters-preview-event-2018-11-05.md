If you haven't read [the announcement of *Ultimate Masters*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-ultimate-masters-2018-11-05), do that right now. I mean, you could read on, but your hype meter probably won't be adequately adjusted. It's okay, everything will still be here when you get back.


Okay, so *Ultimate Masters* is certainly an exciting set. And the fact that you just learned about it now and it already comes out December 7? That's almost now!


But why wait even that long? PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia is hosting a preview event *a week before the set releases!* It's kind of like a Prerelease, but—well, no "but." It's basically that.


Here's the deal: Every day during PAX Unplugged, Pastimes will be running *Ultimate Masters* events in the *Magic* tournament area of the show. You'll have to have a badge for PAX Unplugged. Once in, head to the Wizards of the Coast Tournament Area to register for these events:


**Friday, November 30**


* 12 noon – *Ultimate Masters* Sealed (6 boosters, 3 Swiss rounds)
* 2 p.m. – *Ultimate Masters* Two-Headed Giant (8 boosters/team, 3 Swiss rounds)
* 5 p.m. – *Ultimate Masters* Draft (3 boosters, 3 Swiss rounds)

**Saturday, December 1**


* 12 noon – *Ultimate Masters* Sealed (6 boosters, 3 Swiss rounds)
* 2 p.m. – *Ultimate Masters* Two-Headed Giant (8 boosters/team, 3 Swiss rounds)
* 5 p.m. – *Ultimate Masters* Draft (3 boosters, 3 Swiss rounds)

**Sunday, December 2**


* 11 a.m. – *Ultimate Masters* Two-Headed Giant (8 boosters/team, 3 Swiss rounds)
* 12 noon – *Ultimate Masters* Sealed (6 boosters, 3 Swiss rounds)
