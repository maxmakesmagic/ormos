You look pretty smart. You've probably got the new Standard format all figured out, right? Well, here's your chance to prove it!


The Fantasy Pro Tour lets you predict which cards will show up in this weekend's Pro Tour *Dark Ascension*. Brian David-Marshall [already went into all the details](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/twtw/180), so we'll just hit the high points here.


**STEP ONE**: Go to the [Fantasy Pro Tour](http://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/) on Facebook.


**STEP TWO**: Select a "team" of cards, made up of a Planeswalker, a large creature, a medium creature, a small creature, an instant, a sorcery, an enchantment, an artifact, a nonbasic land. Add a Pro Tour player as your tiebreaker. You have until Friday (Feb. 10) at 2pm EST to lock your rosters.


**STEP THREE**: Once the Pro Tour starts on Friday, you'll be able to compare your team to your friends' teams. Follow the coverage to see what cards are showing up!


**STEP FOUR**: You'll get between 2 and 5 points for every time a card you picked appears in the top-performing Standard decks at the Pro Tour. A "top-performing" deck is one that goes at least 6-4 across the ten Swiss constructed rounds.


**STEP FIVE**: You won! Great work!


That about covers it. The [Fantasy Pro Tour](http://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/) awaits!
