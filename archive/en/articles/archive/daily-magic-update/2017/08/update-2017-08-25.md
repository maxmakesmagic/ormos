The August 25, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on August 25, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by *Commander (2017 Edition)*, which releases today!


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [Grand Prix Indianapolis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpind17) | [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) | 7:15 a.m. PT/10:15 a.m. ET/2:15 p.m. UTC

We've got one last look at *Hour of Devastation* Limited this weekend, as scores of people decend on Indianapolis with fingers crossed a [Glorybringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer) can, well, bring them glory.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. ["Draconic Domination" *Commander 2017* Deck Tech and Upgrades featuring The Ur-Dragon – MTG!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAnl5xreirI) | The Mana Source | Wedge

There are a lot of good suggestions in here on how to build out the "Draconic Domination" deck from *Commander (2017 Edition)*, though I'm honestly looking forward to playing the decks straight out of the box. Still, when the time comes to upgrade them—and that time will come—this is a good place to start.

1. [*Commander 2017* Flavor Spotlight](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snacktimewithmikeandant-08252017-snack-time-55-commander-2017-flavor-spotlight/) | Gathering Magic | Ant Tessitore and Mike Linnemann

*Commander 2017* is packed with flavor, which is right in the wheelhouse of the Snack Time crew. So grab your finest ascot, lift the needle off your favorite record, grab a cold brew, and savor some delicious C17 flavor.


1. [What Made This Standard Format So Great?](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/what-made-this-standard-format-so-great/) | ChannelFireball | Josh Silvestri

My personal theory is that the format's greatness is precisely proportional to how playable [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) is. That means there's still room to improve!


1. [The Scarab God Appreciation Week](https://www.toplevelpodcast.com/the-scarab-god/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

Every week should be [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) appreciation week! I mean, can you imagine reanimating a [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer)? Zombie [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer)!


1. [Sneaky Bad Cards and Sneaky Good Cards](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-403-sneaky-bad-cards-and-sneaky-good-cards/) | Limited Resources | Luis Scott-Vargas and Marshall Sutcliffe

[Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) isn't sneaky good, it's just good, so they don't talk about it here. But they do cover how card evaluation changes as a format evolves, plus thoughts on where *Hour of Devastation* Draft has evolved to. All in a scant 65 minutes.


1. [*Magic* Story: Alara to Amonkhet](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/articles/49648-magic-story-alara-to-amonkhet) | MTGSalvation | Jay Annelli

Before we embark on the voyage that is the *Ixalan* story (starting up again in two weeks!), Jay Annelli takes us on a trip from the Mending to present day.


1. [Five Predictions for the Broken Gatewatch Saga](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/08/five-predictions-broken-gatewatch-saga/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Beck Holden

More story content today, which is always awesome. This one looks forward as Beck Holden makes five predictions for the story from *Hour of Devastation*—where the Gatewatch broke—forward. I love reading these things and then looking back on them when some of the predictions either fail or come to fruition.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [[Survey RESULTS] I'd like to know how you play at FNM](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6vx0z4/survey_results_id_like_to_know_how_you_play_at_fnm/)

I can't speak to the veracity of the survey, but it's certainly an interesting read, especially as something originating from a player.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [New Perspectives](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-08-23)

After failing spectacularly at Pro Tour *Amonkhet*, [New Perspectives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives) combo pretty much fell off the radar. But as more decks become midrange focused and worry more about destroying artifacts with the rise of [God-Pharaoh's Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift) and the return of [Oketra's Monument](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oketra%27s+Monument), it's never been better to base your deck around an enchantment. Or in Melv.P's case, two enchantments. Unlike previous versions of this deck that killed with [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun), people are experimenting with other win conditions. I've seen [Vile Manifestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Manifestation) plus [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling), for example. Melv.P went with a single copy of [Faith of the Devoted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith+of+the+Devoted), which, all-told, requires only ten to thirteen mana (depending on if it was already in play), where [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) required fourteen. It also has the advantage of simply being played for value.


The other big upgrade was [Nimble Obstructionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Obstructionist), which actually does things in Standard right now. Shutting off [Gate to the Afterlife](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gate+to+the+Afterlife), for example, is no small feat. Also, funnily enough, [Nimble Obstructionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Obstructionist) can be used to break up other [New Perspectives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives) decks if they have exactly seven cards in hand when they cycle. [Nimble Obstructionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Obstructionist) can counter the card drawing ability of cycling, since it's activated, keeping your opponent off seven cards and shutting off [New Perspectives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives)' cycling discount.
