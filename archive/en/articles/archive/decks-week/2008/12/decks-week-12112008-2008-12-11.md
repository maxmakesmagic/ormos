It's Thursday and you know what that means: Decks of the Week is here! The 2008 World Championships are happening *right now* and you can find the live coverage of the event on the [Daily MTG section](http://www.magicthegathering.com) of magicthegathering.com. So this week we bring you Decks of the Week, Worlds-is-happening-right-now edition!

Batting in first position are *Shards of Alara* Sealed Top 8 lists from the PTQ season for Kyoto. There are a few weeks left to qualify, so if you haven't trekked to your local PTQ, [what are you waiting for](/en/node/640906)? You can prepare for the event by scoping out the strategies that have been successful so far this season, and of course [you can practice 24/7](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/digital/magiconline.aspx) thanks to **Magic Online**.

The last few Champs lists are straggling in, and we're happy to give you Prince Edward Island's results. Consider it eight more lists you can use as a starting point for playing in **Magic Online** PEs. Speaking of which, want to know what's been successful in the world of digital **Magic**? We've got that too! From regular PEs in the Classic, Standard, Extended, and *Alara* Block formats to the online [Game in the Gulf](/en/events/coverage/magic-cruise-qualifying-season-top-8-decklists) cruise qualifiers and championship, there are a ton of lists to scope out. And, make sure to check back on [magicthegathering.com](http://www.dailymtg.com) all weekend long for live updates from the floor in Memphis, Tennessee, home of the 2008 **Magic** World Championships!
