The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on December 8, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Tim Aten, four-day *Jeopardy!* champion, general trivia master, and editor extraordinaire.](#8)


Today's Musts
=============


1. [Panharmonicon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) Videos

See! It's not just me! People care about this deck! Today, two people in particular—Seth Manfield, who made the Top 8 of [Grand Prix Denver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpden16) with the deck, has [a video and sideboarding talk](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13669&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=12-8-2016). Pascal Maynard, who finished in the Top 64 with the deck, also has [gameplay videos and a discussion of the deck](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-pmayne-standard-uw-panharmonicon/). So I know what I'll be watching today.


And, heck, let's throw in [a written deck guide](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/uw-panharmonicon-deck-guide/) from Eric Froehlich on ChannelFireball. Because the internet loves me today.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Mirror Interviews](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-366-mirror-interviews/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Marshall, meet Luis. Luis, meet Marshall. Now interview one another. Such is the premise of this week's episode. For some reason I have the whole thing pictured like a Wes Anderson movie, complete with awkwardly standing across from one another, a set that looks like it's made out of cardboard, and both men wearing bright colors.


1. [Being Present](http://www.constructedcriticism.com/podcasts/constructed-criticism-164-being-present/) | Constructed Criticism | Spencer Howland, Casey Bloodworth, and Michael Hinderaker

The crew talks Standard, Standard, Standard after all of the action last weekend, and then ties up the show with a discussion of being present in a game of *Magic*, which is kind of like being focused, but, um, well I'll let them explain it.


1. [Blue-Black Metallurgic Summonings Deck Guide](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/ub-metallurgic-summonings-deck-guide/) | ChannelFireball | Bobby Fortanely

[Panharmonicon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) wasn't the only wacky deck to see play at high levels last weekend—Fortanely finished in 11th place at Grand Prix Denver with a [Metallurgic Summonings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallurgic+Summonings) deck. I've seen a number of these lists come in for Standard Showdown as well, so don't be too shocked when someone throws down a five-mana enchantment that doesn't do anything until they untap. Because when they do untap? You're in for a world of pain.


1. [Top 5 Coolest/Weirdest *Magic: The Gathering* Products and Items!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYoslHW3RdM) | The Mana Source | Wedge

*Magic* statutes? A Chandra skateboard? We've had some off-the-wall products over the years, and Wedge collects his Top 5 for your viewing pleasure.

1. [5 Decks You'll Play This Weekend](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/brandonisleib-12082016-5-decks-youll-play-this-weekend/) | Gathering Magic | Brandon Isleib

Isleib looks at some decks you could play this weekend at a Standard Showdown. The first three are pretty well-known, but check out those last two for some interesting brews that have the chops to compete.


Happy Anniversary
=================


1. *Magic: Puzzle Quest*'s First Anniversary

*Magic: Puzzle Quest* is celebrating its first anniversary, and it's celebrating it in style with a new update today (the actual anniversary is December 10). There's a bunch of new stuff—including [*Kaladesh* content](https://d3go.com/mtgpq-card-list-kaladesh/)—and new events. You can check out the [gameplay video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2gnLEw0C_U), which visits all of the new challenges you can face in the game.


But the real challenge? Try to build a deck better than my [Jace, Unraveler of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Unraveler+of+Secrets) deck. [Thopter Spy Network](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Spy+Network) and [Drowner of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope) are just unbeatable together.

[@AllFairness](https://twitter.com/AllFairness) is Tim Aten, an old-school *Magic* Pro and former Wizards of the Coast employee who is now the [four-day champion on *Jeopardy!*](https://www.jeopardy.com/about/this-week-on-jeopardy). And absolutely no one who has ever played trivia with him at a local bar is surprised in the least.

The Masters of Modern posted a whole slew of questions under the hashtag [#YearInReview](https://twitter.com/hashtag/YearInReview?src=hash). Then again, so did a million other non-*Magic* Twitter folks. If you want to partake in their review of 2016, best just to head to [their Twitter page](https://twitter.com/theMMcast) and respond to their questions there.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Mono-Red Isn't Dead

I received a number of aggressive mono-red decks for the Standard Showdown, and all of them look great, but this one struck me as the greatestest. [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) is maybe a touch optimistic in a 24-land [Village Messenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Village+Messenger) deck, but it's hard to argue with just jamming Chandras in your red deck.


Not only is this deck aggressive and burn-minded, but it also has the [Hanweir Garrison](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanweir+Garrison) and [Hanweir Battlements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanweir+Battlements) combo to just Eldrazi some people out. I know the red mages around here approve, so why not burn some people out at this Saturday's Standard Showdown?
