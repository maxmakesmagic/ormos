Everybody reading this knows who Jace is. At least I hope they do. He's kind of a big deal in **Magic**. In  ***Magic** 2014*  he looks like this:

And in  ***Magic** 2014*  he got a new friend. A blue flying eel: [Jace's Mindseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Mindseeker)!

I can only imagine the trouble that the vet went through to apply that magical tattoo. (In fact, rumor has it that three goblins died in the procedure!)


But, if you look closer at the markings around the Mindseeker's eye you might realize they can actually be found on Jace's clothing! Here's [Jace's Mindseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Mindseeker) next to the art from [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure).

Now, for another fun thing to do with this new card, let's take a look at Greg Staples' original sketch for the Mindseeker.
