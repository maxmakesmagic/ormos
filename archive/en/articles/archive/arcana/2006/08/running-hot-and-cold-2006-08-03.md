[Thermopod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Thermopod) is a snow creature, but it super-heats its underside to glide over the ice. [Surging Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surging+Flame) depicts an orc shaman surrounded by snow and freezing rain, yet he summons a gout of spiraling flame on his enemies. There is definitely a tension between hot and cold in *Coldsnap*-era Terisiare, with Heidar and his Rimewind wizards at the center of it.

[Braid of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braid+of+Fire) depicts a shaman so focused on his meditation that he has melted the snow around him.

[Thermal Flux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Flux) shows a rocky outcropping draped in a chilly shawl of snow, but also thawing from the sun's heat. (Hi, Cantrip Week!)

There's quite the thermal jumble going on in the art of [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance), in which a spell has annihiliated with its illusionary counterpart, sort of like a matter-antimatter reaction.
