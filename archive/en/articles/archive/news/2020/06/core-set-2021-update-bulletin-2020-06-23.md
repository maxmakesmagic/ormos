Hello, everyone!


I'm here on warm and toasty Regatha, since *Core Set 2020* is all about . . . um . . .


I see Teferi's up to his time tricks. Moving right along, it's time for *Core Set 2021*! If you care about more than the Dog update (and I wouldn't blame you if that's all you care about—they're good Dogs), read on.


As usual, you'll be able to find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/)—at this time, one or both of those might not be updated just yet, so I'm describing a general truth here. Keep in mind that this article was written before the rules changes were finalized in editing, so there may be minor deviations from what I describe below.
