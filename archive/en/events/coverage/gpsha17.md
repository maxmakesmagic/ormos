DAY 2 COVERAGE



At dawn, 714 players from around the region converged at Shanghai, each hoping to be crowned a Grand Prix Champion. By dusk, grizzled veteran Song Huachao took down the trophy with Temur Energy, keeping the title on local soil.


Grand Prix Kobe 2015 Champion Takuma Morofuji an astonishing run, going 15-0 in the Swiss rounds. Such a hot streak would have been perfect if he had won it all, however Morofuji fell in the quarterfinals.


This weekend was also memorable for (12) Yuuya Watanabe, tying Martin Jůza, Oliver Ruel, and Shuhei Nakamura at 28 lifetime Grand Prix Top 8s apiece. In addition, this weekend was his chance to achieve a record-breaking 8th Grand Prix title to break three-way tie with Shuhei Nakamura and Kai Budde but that dream would have to wait another day.


Team MTG Mint Card’s (8) Kelvin Chew lost to Yam Wing Chun in Round 10, but still ended up making the Top 8 together. In addition, fellow Hong Konger Lee Wing Tat who was part of Yam’s local playtesting team also made it through. Moral of the story? Teamwork does pay off! Rounding off the rest of the Top 8 were finalist Hironao Tanaka and semifinalist Naoya Okada for their breakthrough!


Congratulations to Song Huachao once again for winning Grand Prix Shanghai 2017!
