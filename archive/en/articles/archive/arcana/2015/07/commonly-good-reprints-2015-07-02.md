As the final core set, *Magic Origins* has a fair number of reprints re-energizing Standard. Just last Friday [Sam Stoddard re-introduced us to](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/reprints-magic-origins-2015-06-26) [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver). And while not all reprints can be that splashy, we'll be happy to have a number of these back in Standardâ€¦or continuing in Standard for the time being. So, as a bonus preview before the entire set is revealed tomorrow, here are five returning common cards in *Magic Origins*, one for each color.

Originally printed in M14, [Celestial Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Flare) saw quite a bit of Standard play in White-Blue Control decks while also playing a pretty strong role in Limited. Back again in *Origins*, it seems like a pretty good way to handle lone Dragons going after your life total.

Good old [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). It's not going anywhere any time soon.

Originally printed as a common in *Onslaught*, [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) was bumped to an uncommon for *Ninth Edition* and *Tenth Edition*, where it saw quite a bit of Standard play in concert with [Promise of Bunrei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Bunrei). That combo is long gone, but *Origins* gives you another opportunity to seek out [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk)-powered combos.

Here's a saucy one. Often seen in Modern Burn sideboards, [Smash to Smithereens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smash+to+Smithereens) hasn't seen the light of Standard since *Shadowmoor*. Now back to wreck the dreams of many an artificer, Smash will surely see some play if there are any artifacts that need exploding.

Finally, we have [Might of the Masses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+the+Masses), a truly tough trick back in *Rise of the Eldrazi*. Best when paired with tokens, [Might of the Masses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+the+Masses) can deliver a ton of damage for a single mana. Be very wary of it when doing math in Limited. "She can't surely deal an extra 5 damage for a single mana, can she?" Yes, yes she can.
