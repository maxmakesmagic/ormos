Yuuya Watanabe found a way to defeat the nearly invincible Shouta Yasooka [in the finals of the Players Championship](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/finalscrushing-cascades-2012-08-31) to capture his second Player of the Year title. Watanabe joins the immortal Kai Budde as the only multiple Player-of-the-Year winners.


Yasooka entered the Top 4 as the dominant favorite, having dropped just one match over the entire tournament prior to the finals. But Watanabe prevailed in a thrilling five-game match over his countryman to be crowned the 2011-2012 Player of the Year.
