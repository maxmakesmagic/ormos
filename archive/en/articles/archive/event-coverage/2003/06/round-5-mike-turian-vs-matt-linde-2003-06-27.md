![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natus03/a895.jpg)Two of the longest running members of the Pro Tour gravy train met in a round five Feature Match. Mike Turian and Matt Linde each won all three day 1 constructed matches, but each lost their first draft match of the tournament. Turian was running a soldier deck with a splash of blue while Linde's deck is mono-black.

Turian came out fast in Game 1 with [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) and [Zealous Inquisitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Inquisitor). However, when he failed to play a land on turn four he looked over at me and growled. It seems that my former teammate never seems to draw any land when I watch him play.

I was forgiven a turn later when Turian's deck delivered up a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and enabled a 4/4 [Daru Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger). Linde had already used his [Death Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Pulse) on the early Inquisitor so Turian was pretty happy with his Stinger, but the last card in Linde's hand was [Lingering Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Death). Turian sent in his team and bashed Linde down to 4 before his 4/4 Stinger finished dying and then Turian promptly drew a second one off the top of his deck. One turn later Linde was scooping up his cards.

Linde had two copies of [Lingering Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Death) in game 2 along with a [Deathmark Prelate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark+Prelate) and a [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival), so it was hard for Turian to keep his creatures alive. The [Crown of Awe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Awe) that he brought in from the sideboard came in quite handy, though, since it staved off the [Lingering Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Death) of a [Zealous Inquisitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Inquisitor) and then created a monster that Linde's mono-black deck just couldn't deal with.

Turian even showed off a nice trick by shooting his own Inquisitor with a 2/2 [Daru Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger) so he could redirect the damage to kill Linde's 1/1 [Crypt Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Sliver). In the end all Linde could do was shrug and lament "I can't beat a Crown ..."

**Final Result:** Turian – 2 (now 4-1), Linde – 0 (now 3-2)
