Ah, but who are these people? Obviously they're all incredible people (especially the ones who work on this website) but what if we could get their answers to some basic questions?


### Aaron Forsythe


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm the Director of Research & Development for *Magic*.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** Sometime before *Fallen Empires* came out—early '94.


**What is your favorite card?** [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** By threatening—I mean "motivating"—all my employees to play their hardest.




---

### Chris Kiritz


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am currently the Business Manager for **Magic* Online*.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** Started in 1994 and played super casually. Started playing for real with *Tempest* and *Urza's Block* and stopped again after *Invasion* block. Started again with *Lorwyn* and haven't looked back.


**What is your favorite card?** I really have a soft spot for [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), but I still get a kick out of playing ridiculous beaters with [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack).


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** By playing *Magic* digitally. Also, by helping ensure that they are so dazzled by their experience here that they cannot concentrate on the game. Failing all else, I will have the dev team "fix" the shuffler.




---

### Dave Guskin


**What do you do for Wizards?** I work in *Magic* R&D on the Digital team, which includes design and development work for *Magic Online*, *Duels of the Planeswalkers*, and other exciting upcoming Digital projects related to *Magic*!


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** I started playing around *Revised/Antiquities* and continued playing until around *Alliances*. I returned to the game around the time of *Odyssey* block.


**What is your favorite card?** My favorite card is [Etched Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle), although [Deathbringer Thoctar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathbringer+Thoctar) (one of my first designs printed!) is a close second.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** My unique powers of programming (from my previous jobs) and game design give me mastery of the ancient art of Shufflemancy, which will allow me to mana screw all of our Community Team opponents. Suckers! In all honesty, I play FFL Standard internally, so I'm an experienced master at the format.




---

### Dave Humpherys


**What do you do for Wizards?** Manage the R&D development team


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** Spring break of 1994


**What is your favorite card?** [Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Intimidating bling




---

### Dave Marsee


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a UI designer for the new version of *Magic Online*.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** October 2009, right after *Zendikar* was released.


**What is your favorite card?** For fun: [Admonition Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Admonition+Angel). I play this land, and your stuff disappears!  



**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Through the power of HUMONGOUS CREATURES!




---

### Dwayne St. Arnauld


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a Test Lead for the new MTGO client.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** I started playing around *The Dark*, took a break and came back when *Lorwyn* came out.


**What is your favorite card?** My favorite card is [Plow Under](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plow+Under) (says a lot about me, right?)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Since I still playtest competitive formats in the Tourney Practice room, I think my "game" is still at a high level! The Community is going down!




---

### Erik Lauer


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am a developer. I was on every development team in standard, and led M11 and *Mirrodin Besieged*.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** Beta


**What is your favorite card?** [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence)

**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** Late 1994 (*Fallen Empires*)


**What is your favorite card?** [Tawnos's Coffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tawnos%27s+Coffin)/[Mana Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Ages old strategy: "Play Cards, Win Game"




---

### Gordon Culp


**What do you do for Wizards?** I direct the Game Systems Design team for the *Magic* Digital Studio. The studio’s architects, UX Designers, Visual Designers, Tech Analysts and Tech Writers make up the Design Team.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** I began playing *Magic* my second day at work in April 1997. I was taught to play with *Fifth Edition* cradz.


**What is your favorite card?** My favorite card is still [Rhystic Cave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhystic+Cave). My play group at Wizards took to mocking its effectiveness, and my whole cube ended up wallpapered with them for a short time. I am still plotting my revenge.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** As before, I will lull the Community team into complacency with my mediocrity, then the S-M-R-T members of the Wizards team will defeat them.




---

### Jason Radabuagh


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am a software developer and I work on *Magic: The Gathering Online*. Specifically I work on what we call the Content Team, which is responsible for new sets, decks and other content created for your enjoyment. In particular, I work quite a bit with the MTGO rules engine, implementing new cards and fixing bugs.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** Fourth grade. I remember being super excited trading for my first [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire). I played until late *Tempest*  block, then fell out of the game until around *Mirrodin*, which came out when I was in college. I picked the game back up, and have playing ever since.


**What is your favorite card?**  I really like recursion, so it is hard to find a card I like more than [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), or maybe [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). I am also a big fan of [Kazuul, Tyrant of the Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazuul%2C+Tyrant+of+the+Cliffs), since that is the one card I designed.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Let's just say the MTGO shuffler has been "fixed".




---

### Jon Hickey


**What do you do for Wizards?** Assistant Brand Manager. I work on marketing and stuff.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** 1994. I was in 4th grade and played on the cement during recess. It was a simpler time.


**What is your favorite card?**  [Library of Alexandria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria) (My copy is signed by Richard Garfield. He drew birds on it.)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Honestly, we don't really need help. It's pretty obvious who is going to win.




---

### Kelly Digges


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am the editor of **DailyMTG.com**, and it's also my privilege and pleasure to moonlight on design and development teams—so far, for *Worldwake*, *Archenemy*, **Magic* 2012*, and [REDACTED].


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** I started playing some time in 1995, when *Revised Edition* was the latest set. Two friends of mine invited me over to show me this awesome new game they found. There was a [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape), and a [Wall of Wood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Wood), and a [Living Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wall)... They weren't the most exciting cards, and we barely understood the rules, but I was intrigued enough to buy some cards of my own. My very first pack had a [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) in it, and that was that—I was hooked for life.


**What is your favorite card?** This question is so impossible—you do realize *there are more than 11,000 *Magic* cards*, right?—but if I absolutely had to pick just one, it would probably be [Rite of Replication](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Replication) (kicked, of course). Something crazy happens every time that card gets cast, whether it's five [Hellkite Charger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellkite+Charger)s swinging for the win in Limited, five [Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor)s watching each other's backs in Commander, or billions of [Precursor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precursor+Golem)s filling the board in my wildest dreams.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** An elaborate campaign of propaganda and misinformation to turn the public against them. If that fails, beat them at *Magic*, I guess?




---

### Lee Sharpe


**What do you do for Wizards?** 'm a data analyst for Wizards of the Coast's digital platforms, with my primary focus on *Magic Online*. This involves helping to determine what tournament offerings are available for players, including entry fees, prize structures, and other factors. I also work on the event coverage you see on [mtgonline.com](http://www.mtgonline.com/) , *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS), *Magic Online* Player Rewards (MOPR), and data you see in the *Magic Online* Newsletter. I also assist R&D with card templating and rules work, and I was on the development team for the Commander product, which is on sale soon!


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** The first set that I ever played with was Revised.


**What is your favorite card?** I have trouble pinning down a specific card, but when I cube draft, 2-power creatures for 1 mana fill my deck. I have a great love for the Boros aggro decks, so anything that goes in that deck is awesome.


**How will you help defeat the Community Cup?** First I'll crush everyone in Modern matches. I don't know what deck I'm playing yet, but I'm confident it will be the nuts. After that, I'll head out to karaoke with willing Community Cup players, alongside coverage reporter and karaoke ringer Nate Price. In addition to providing them with a good time, they'll be tired and not in great shape to play Standard on Friday morning. Ask Evan Erwin, he knows what I'm talking about. Wait, the community team doesn't get to read these bios, right?




---

### Mark Rosewater


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am the Head Designer for *Magic*.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** I began playing during *Alpha*.


**What is your favorite card?** [Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro).


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I plan to lower their morale through careful taunting.




---

### Matt Tabak


**What do you do for Wizards?** I work in R&D as an editor. I'm also the current *Magic* Rules Manager. My responsibilities include maintaining the well-oiled machine that is the rulebook. Also, I make sure we're pushing the envelope in responsible, comprehensible ways.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** It was about four in the afternoon (in June 1995)


**What is your favorite card?** My [Spiny Starfish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiny+Starfish) deck will always hold a dear place in my heart.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I'm hoping my undefeated record helps. If we need even more help, I'm perfectly willing to change some rules on the fly. [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb)'s not legal in Modern, is it?




---

### Max McCall


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm one of the development interns for *Magic* R&D. They pay me to draft. It's pretty awesome.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** *Ice Age*.


**What is your favorite card?**  [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam).


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** The current plan is to distract LSV by throwing copies of [Gruesome Encore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruesome+Encore) at him every ninety seconds.




---

### Mike Robles


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm part of the Community Team! Wait... not the MTGO Community Team... although I am part of that. I'm a Community Manager for *Magic: The Gathering*! I engage players in conversation on Twitter, Facebook, the Forums, and on my personal Twitter account. Oh, and when I go to conventions, I USUALLY have a ton of free stuff to give away. For some reason that makes me REALLY popular.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** I actually started playing during *Alpha*. Why did I get rid of all those cards? I played a lot, my friends and I would buy boxes, sell the rares, and buy more boxes. I quit just after *Ice Age*, then came back right around the Kamigawa block. I really liked the original *Mirrodin* block and had an amazing 5 color deck that revolved around [Doubling Cube](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Cube) and [Door to Nothingness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+to+Nothingness).


**What is your favorite card?** What?!? That's like asking a parent to choose their favorite child. I don't know if it's just for the pure nostalgia value or not, but I might have to go with the original [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). It's like the guy in the artwork was saying "HA H-awe..."


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Simple. Mind Games. And pure intimidation.




---

### Mike Turian


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm the Organized Play Digital Manager. I work on projects such as Wizards Event Reporter and the Store & Event Locator. Being in Organized Play means I get to work with all of our awesome OP offerings such as Friday Night *Magic*, Pro Play, and *Magic* Celebration! Before Organized Play I was in *Magic* R&D where I was the Development lead for sets like *Scars of Mirrodin*, *Worldwake*, and *Conflux* (among others).


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** I started playing *Magic* during my sophomore year of high school. That was the fall of 1994, 17 years ago!


**What is your favorite card?**  [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland). I love all non-blue *Magic* cards but I have a special place in my heart for [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)!


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I'm pretty good at drafting.




---

### Monty Ashley


**What do you do for Wizards?** I have a variety of website-related duties, including writing *Magic* Arcana, the finest *Magic* column in the world. Just look around you and feel how great this Arcana is. And I didn't even write most of it! Hey, while I've got you here, I want you to know that tomorrow's Arcana is going to be amazing. So watch for that!


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** A week after it debuted at Gen Con, I saw a couple of *Alpha* starters at the 1993 San Diego Comic Con. It took a few weeks to get my own cards, though, because I had to convince my local game store to start carrying *Magic*.


**What is your favorite card?** Either [Silhouette](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhouette) (for its art) or [Bullwhip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bullwhip) (for its incredible power in Rath Cycle draft). Or the *Worldwake* Plant token. Oh! Actually, it's [Fluctuator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fluctuator). Yeah. Definitely that one.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** If the Wizards Team loses, I have the power to change the website to reflect whatever result I want to have happened. That seems like something that could come in handy.




---

### Ryan Spain


**What do you do for Wizards?** As of this writing I haven't started yet, but ostensibly I've been hired in R&D as a game designer for the Digital team, working primarily on *Magic Online*. I can neither confirm nor deny the rumors that I was actually hired as a Limited ringer to ensure Wizards victory in this year's Community Cup, but either way, I'm thrilled to be joining the team that makes the best strategy game in the world!


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** In 1995 I played my first game of *Magic* against Marshall Sutcliffe of the Community team, got sidetracked immediately by an infatuation with another CCG, but came back to *Magic* heavily in 1996 and have been playing ever since.


**What is your favorite card?** [Warp World](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp+World)! I'm a Limited Spike, but a Constructed Timmy/Johnny, and Warp World is my favorite card for pulling off epic things cleverly. My favorite common pack one, pick one in Draft is probably [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter).


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Having just come from the community side, I know how they think, I can get in their heads--especially Marshall's. Some may question my loyalties having switched sides so recently, but I look forward to proving my allegiance to Wizards of the Coast on the Community Cup battlefield! Marsh, I love you like a little brother, but I'm going to crush you like a little brother, too.




---

### Tom LaPille


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a developer. I help decide what cards should do. I led the development of *Masters Edition III, Masters Edition IV, Archenemy*, and **Magic* 2012*.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** *Tempest*.


**What is your favorite card?** [Grim Lavamancer.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer.)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** By going 4-0.




---

### Troy Reppas


**What do you do for Wizards? *Magic*** Game Support


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** *Invasion* Paper Block


**What is your favorite card?** [Healing Salve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healing+Salve)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** You meant, [Crush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush), [Annihilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annihilate), and [Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) them, right? Let's just say they won't know what a [Whippoorwill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whippoorwill) is when we're done with them.




---

### Worth Wollpert


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am the *Magic* Studio director and I am in charge of all things related to digital *Magic* for Wizards.


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** 1993 - half my life ago!


**What is your favorite card?** Probably most proud of [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander), a card I designed, but my favorite card is probably [Jackal Pap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pap) (note the correct spelling here) or [Mise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mise)!


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Basically I plan to be a giant lucksack and watch as all my opponents mulligan to 2.




---

### Zac Hill


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a designer/developer for *Magic* R&D. I make the cards!


**When did you first start playing *Magic*?** I learned how to play on an airplane when I was 8 years old. *Revised* was the newest set.


**What is your favorite card?** As a player? [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). As a designer? [Stormtide Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormtide+Leviathan).


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** By striking fear into the hearts of my enemies, and competing with bloodlust in my heart.




---

So what exactly is the Wizards Team playing for? Well, if the Community Team manages to defeat the Wizards Team, all players who log on to *Magic Online* anytime on Wednesday, June 15; Thursday, June 16; or Friday, June 17, will be invited to a no-entry-requirement Planeswalker-format Constructed tournament on July 3! All players who play in this four-round, Swiss-pairings event will receive one **Magic* 2011* booster pack. All players who earn 12 match points by going undefeated will also receive any three *Magic Online* booster packs of their choice—yes, *any* three!


If the Wizards Team wins, however, players will not go empty handed; all players who logged in between June 13 and June 17 will receive a Darksteel Relic promotional card with a June 17, 2011 date stamp!


While all new accounts created within the last year have Planeswalker cards, players on older accounts who do not have any Planeswalker cards can contact Game Support to get a free Planeswalker Deck Pack so they can participate in this tournament in the unlikely event the Community Team actually does win.


Good luck, Community. You'll need it!
